  1:   56| [45] [--Once Natsuhiko and the others had overridden the security lockouts--]
  2:  134| [45] [Watase, Jun, Ukita, and Salyu arrived at Area Zero.]
  3:  140| [45] [The Senior Fellows that Watase had brought down with him on his last trip there were lying dead by the elevators.]
  4:  145| [45] [Watase had resigned himself to their deaths, and everyone else knew about their fates due to Natsuhiko's BC usage on them all earlier, so none of them were surprised, but--]
  5:  150| [47] [Watase]
  6:  151| [45] [(... I'm sorry.)]
  7:  156| [45] [Watase still felt deep regret about the whole thing.]
  8:  161| [45] [Jun put her hands together in prayer for the two lost souls, then looked around.]
  9:  190| [47] [Jun]
 10:  193| [45] ["I can't believe there's a place like this under LABO..."]
 11:  219| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  222| [45] ["The deepest basement area... the heart of LABO."]
 13:  227| [45] [Ukita looked away from the bodies and muttered to himself.]
 14:  250| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  251| [45] ["..."]
 16:  256| [45] [Salyu said nothing. She just looked at the ceiling with dull eyes.]
 17:  264| [47] [Watase]
 18:  267| [45] ["... I planted the bomb in Subject N's room. Let's go."]
 19:  318| [45] [Watase led everyone to the room in question.]
 20:  323| [45] [And when they got there--]
 21:  379| [47] [Jun]
 22:  382| [45] ["What... this is--!?"]
 23:  387| [45] [Jun couldn't help raising her voice in shock.]
 24:  395| [47] [Watase]
 25:  398| [45] ["This was Subject N's straightjacket. They restrained her in this thing."]
 26:  433| [47] [Jun]
 27:  436| [45] ["N-no, not that..."]
 28:  441| [45] [Jun looked around.]
 29:  446| [45] [Not at the straightjacket, but at the entire room.]
 30:  454| [47] [Watase]
 31:  457| [45] ["What's wrong, Moribe?"]
 32:  483| [47] [Jun]
 33:  486| [45] ["... No, nevermind. Anyway, let's take care of that bomb pronto!"]
 34:  512| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  515| [45] ["Indeed!"]
 36:  520| [45] [The group ran over to the bomb set in the middle of the room.]
 37:  607| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  610| [45] ["This the tetryl bomb?"]
 39:  618| [47] [Watase]
 40:  621| [45] ["Yeah. The detonator to this one is much more complex than the other bombs."]
 41:  629| [47] [Watase]
 42:  632| [45] ["It's got a tilt sensor and an optical sensor, so it won't be easy to disarm."]
 43:  658| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  661| [45] ["Sheesh, how typical of a terrorist organization..."]
 45:  696| [47] [Jun]
 46:  699| [45] ["But we can probably take care of it if we can remove the digital protection."]
 47:  725| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  728| [45] ["Understood. First we undo the protection. Now that Alice is connected, we use the liquid nitrogen on it."]
 49:  736| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  739| [45] ["We can't do anything if we don't disable the sensors first, see."]
 51:  747| [47] [Watase]
 52:  750| [45] ["Got it."]
 53:  755| [45] [Watase then took the liquid nitrogen can out of his pocket.]
 54:  760| [45] [He was then about to use it on the bomb when--]
 55:  832| [47] [Watase]
 56:  833| [45] [(...!?)]
 57:  838| [45] [He suddenly noticed something.]
 58:  870| [47] [Jun]
 59:  873| [45] ["What's wrong, Captain!? If you don't hurry, the time of the explosion's gonna..."]
 60:  881| [47] [Watase]
 61:  884| [45] ["W-well, about that--"]
 62: 1025| [45] [Everyone looked at the bomb's timer when he said that.]
 63: 1031| [45] [The digital countdown displayed the time remaining until the explosion.]
 64: 1077| [45] ["00:39:16"]
 65: 1123| [45] ["00:39:15"]
 66: 1169| [45] ["00:39:14"]
 67: 1229| [45] [According to Watase's watch, the current time was "5:37:47".]
 68: 1234| [45] [It was then that Watase realized--]
 69: 1239| [45] [No-- that he -remembered- it.]
 70: 1247| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1250| [45] ["H-hey...!"]
 72: 1258| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1261| [45] ["The detonation time...!"]
 74: 1269| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1272| [45] ["It was set to '6:17 PM', wasn't it!?"]
 76: 1298| [47] [Jun]
 77: 1301| [45] ["Wh-what about it...!?"]
 78: 1309| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1312| [45] ["This doesn't make sense!"]
 80: 1320| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1323| [45] ["I made sure to set the bomb so that it went off one minute after the lockdown was lifted!"]
 82: 1331| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1334| [45] ["So-- why did the timer in the control room say the lockdown would lift at '6:19 PM'!?"]
 84: 1342| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1345| [45] ["That's two minutes short! The bomb'll go off before the lockdown's lifted!!"]
 86: 1409| [47] [All 3]
 87: 1412| [45] ["!!"]
 88: 1423| [45] [Everyone gasped.]
 89: 1428| [45] [The bomb's timer wasn't off.]
 90: 1433| [45] [It was the lockdown timer that was off-- it was now scheduled for just a few minutes later than when Watase and Ukita had first checked it.]
 91: 1459| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1462| [45] ["Y-yeah, that is strange! When we went to the control room for the first time at the start of the search--"]
 93: 1470| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1473| [45] ["Brain Cell showed that the lockdown would be lifted at '6:16 PM'!"]
 95: 1499| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1502| [45] ["Why...? When was it delayed!?"]
 97: 1510| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1513| [45] ["I-I don't know! Did someone change the lockdown end time!?"]
 99: 1539| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1542| [45] ["No, that's impossible!"]
101: 1568| [47] [Ukita]
102: 1571| [45] ["Brain Cell automatically sets that time based on the BC particle energy level readings in Area N!"]
103: 1597| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1600| [45] ["Normally, it'd be impossible for the lockdown end time to fall behind!"]
105: 1626| [47] [Salyu]
106: 1629| [45] ["What could cause it, then?"]
107: 1655| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1658| [45] ["Mmm... well, I suppose it could happen if the amplifier went haywire again and caused the BC particle energy levels to rise once more, or..."]
109: 1666| [47] [Watase]
110: 1669| [45] ["...!?"]
111: 1674| [45] [Something about Ukita's explanation clicked in Watase's mind.]
112: 1704| [47] [Watase]
113: 1707| [45] ["O-old man... what'd you just say!?"]
114: 1733| [47] [Ukita]
115: 1736| [45] ["Huh? Oh, well, if the WX particle amplifier were to go haywire again--"]
116: 1744| [47] [Watase]
117: 1747| [45] ["No, before that!"]
118: 1755| [47] [Watase]
119: 1758| [45] ["How did you say Brain Cell automatically sets the lockdown end time!?"]
120: 1784| [47] [Ukita]
121: 1787| [45] ["That's..."]
122: 1813| [47] [Ukita]
123: 1816| [45] ["It does that by measuring the BC particle energy readings in Area N and calculating approximately how long it'll take for them to die down to 1 mSv."]
124: 1845| [47] [Watase]
125: 1848| [45] ["...!"]
126: 1895| [45] [Just then, numerous pieces fell into place in Watase's head.]
127: 1949| [45] [The fact that Natsuhiko had been lying unconscious in Area N for a long time.]
128: 1954| [45] [The auditory hallucination he had heard for six hours.]
129: 2006| [45] [Senses Sympathy.]
130: 2011| [45] [Communicators.]
131: 2063| [45] [BC particle energy levels--]
132: 2086| [47] [Watase]
133: 2089| [45] ["... Now I get it. I've figured out why the lockdown end time changed..."]
134: 2115| [47] [Jun]
135: 2118| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
136: 2126| [47] [Watase]
137: 2129| [45] ["It wasn't just the WX particle amplifier that was amplifying the BC particle energy levels."]
138: 2137| [47] [Watase]
139: 2140| [45] ["It was also Natsuhiko... He was amplifying the energy levels in Area N for six hours."]
140: 2148| [47] [Watase]
141: 2151| [45] ["Because he was constantly using BC in Area N that whole time!"]
142: 2212| [47] [Jun]
143: 2215| [45] ["Ah...! Aaaaah!"]
144: 2241| [47] [Ukita]
145: 2244| [45] ["I-I see... so the energy produced by the WX particle amplifier and the energy emitted by Natsuhiko together--"]
146: 2270| [47] [Ukita]
147: 2273| [45] ["Added up to a slight increase of the overall BC particle energy levels in Area N!"]
148: 2299| [47] [Salyu]
149: 2302| [45] ["So that means Brain Cell recalculated the lockdown end time--"]
150: 2310| [47] [Watase]
151: 2313| [45] ["Yeah."]
152: 2318| [45] [Watase instinctively held his head.]
153: 2326| [47] [Watase]
154: 2329| [45] ["So the lockdown end time was extended by three minutes, meaning the bomb will go off two minutes before then...!"]
155: 2334| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at those words.]
156: 2360| [47] [Jun]
157: 2363| [45] ["Th-this is real bad... we need to let the others know!"]
158: 2389| [47] [Ukita]
159: 2392| [45] ["No, there's no time for that...!"]
160: 2418| [47] [Salyu]
161: 2421| [45] ["What would telling them even accomplish? It won't do anything to improve the situation."]
162: 2429| [47] [Watase]
163: 2432| [45] ["Y-yeah...!"]
164: 2515| [45] [Despite his words, Watase was feeling intense regret.]
165: 2520| [45] [Though he'd already set the bomb, he figured the nine of them could just wait for the lockdown to lift and escape as soon as that happened.]
166: 2525| [45] [But with the bomb set to go off before the lockdown ended, freeing Kazami from her malice wouldn't matter in the slightest.]
167: 2530| [45] [They would all die in the explosion.]
168: 2535| [47] [Watase]
169: 2536| [45] [(Goddammit, this can't be happening...!)]
170: 2541| [47] [Watase]
171: 2542| [45] [(This never would have happened if we hadn't set the bomb to begin with!)]
172: 2547| [45] [Just as Watase thought that--]
173: 2558| [45] [--he heard some noise coming from the ceiling.]
174: 2566| [47] [Watase]
175: 2569| [45] ["What was that!?"]
176: 2575| [45] [He looked up in surprise.]
177: 2580| [45] [When he did, he heard Natsuhiko's voice coming out of a speaker built into the ceiling.]
178: 2588| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2591| [45] ["--Ms. Tachibana, can you hear me?"]
