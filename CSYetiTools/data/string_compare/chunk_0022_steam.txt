  1:   22| [45] [--]
  2:   27| [45] [----]
  3:   32| [45] [------His consciousness was in eternal darkness.]
  4:   37| [45] [Without the ability to rely on his five senses, he had no clue where he was.]
  5:   42| [47] [Watase]
  6:   43| [45] [(... I'm...?)]
  7:   48| [45] [His hazy mind just barely managed to construct that thought. He then--]
  8:   53| [45] [--made out the sound of someone breathing nearby.]
  9:  125| [47] [???]
 10:  128| [45] ["... *huff* *huff*..."]
 11:  136| [47] [???]
 12:  139| [45] ["... Sheesh, Captain Kasasagi, you sure do weigh a ton...!"]
 13:  144| [47] [Watase]
 14:  145| [45] [(...?)]
 15:  204| [45] [When he opened his eyes, he saw half of someone's face.]
 16:  209| [45] [It seemed someone was walking while carrying him on their shoulder.]
 17:  214| [47] [Watase]
 18:  215| [45] [("Captain Kasasagi"...? Who's that...?)]
 19:  220| [45] [No sooner had he thought this than did everything come back to him.]
 20:  225| [47] [Watase]
 21:  226| [45] [(That's right! I fell unconscious...!)]
 22:  231| [45] [Watase's fives senses swiftly recovered with that thought.]
 23:  301| [47] [Watase]
 24:  304| [45] ["Teach...?"]
 25:  352| [47] [Ena]
 26:  355| [45] ["Oh! You're awake?"]
 27:  363| [47] [Ena]
 28:  366| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, are you okay?"]
 29:  374| [47] [Watase]
 30:  377| [45] ["Wh-where am I...? Why are you...?"]
 31:  428| [45] [The last thing Watase remembered was chasing that girl.]
 32:  433| [45] [He tried to recall what happened after that, but all he found was a total blank.]
 33:  441| [47] [Ena]
 34:  444| [45] ["Ms. Moribe found you lying in the inner ring and brought you all the way back to the emergency staircase."]
 35:  452| [47] [Ena]
 36:  455| [45] ["She's currently putting out the fire on floor B2 with Ms. Tachibana."]
 37:  463| [47] [Ena]
 38:  466| [45] ["So they asked me to take you back to the control room."]
 39:  482| [47] [Watase]
 40:  485| [45] ["So that's what happened... sorry for giving you so much trouble."]
 41:  493| [47] [Ena]
 42:  496| [45] ["You've got that right. It was hell to carry you and your heavy carcass all the way up those stairs, you know."]
 43:  501| [45] [Watase gave Ena a wry smile, then suddenly remembered something.]
 44:  509| [47] [Watase]
 45:  512| [45] ["... By the way, what happened with that girl?"]
 46:  523| [47] [Watase]
 47:  526| [45] ["So that's what happened... by the way, what happened with that girl?"]
 48:  534| [47] [Ena]
 49:  537| [45] ["Well... according to Ms. Moribe, it seems Ms. Sannomiya got away."]
 50:  545| [47] [Ena]
 51:  548| [45] ["She said she searched the entire contaminated zone in the inner ring, but didn't even find a trace of her."]
 52:  556| [47] [Watase]
 53:  559| [45] ["Did she run away to another area...?"]
 54:  564| [45] [Watase had no clue where she'd disappeared to.]
 55:  569| [45] [He felt like he'd seen her running off somewhere just before he collapsed--]
 56:  574| [45] [But he'd been hit with a particularly painful headache right after that, causing his memories around that point to be extremely vague at best.]
 57:  579| [45] [But he knew for a fact that she'd run away.]
 58:  587| [47] [Watase]
 59:  590| [45] ["Why'd she run off like that...?"]
 60:  598| [47] [Ena]
 61:  601| [45] ["... No clue. Got any ideas?"]
 62:  609| [47] [Watase]
 63:  612| [45] ["None..."]
 64:  707| [45] [But thinking back on it, Yuuri had clearly been scared back when he'd first met her.]
 65:  712| [45] [Perhaps Watase's face looked especially frightening to them in an environment like this.]
 66:  758| [47] [Watase]
 67:  759| [45] [(No, or maybe...)]
 68:  764| [45] [Maybe the girl had also found those bodies. Anyone would be shaken after seeing something like that.]
 69:  769| [45] [In the end, Watase was no closer to figuring out the truth.]
 70:  785| [55] [√After Chapter 2]
 71:  793| [45] [Watase sighed and moved away from Ena.]
 72:  855| [47] [Ena]
 73:  858| [45] ["Can you walk?"]
 74:  866| [47] [Watase]
 75:  869| [45] ["Yeah..."]
 76:  877| [47] [Watase]
 77:  880| [45] ["Anyway, she ran off into a contaminated zone... so it's possible she's being exposed to radiation."]
 78:  888| [47] [Ena]
 79:  891| [45] ["Actually, there might be some hope on that front."]
 80:  896| [45] [Ena said that and took something out.]
 81:  940| [45] [It was an empty AD ampule.]
 82:  952| [47] [Watase]
 83:  955| [45] ["What's that?"]
 84:  981| [47] [Ena]
 85:  984| [45] ["It was lying near the staircase. If Ms. Sannomiya was the one who used it, then that gives her at least some protection."]
 86:  992| [47] [Watase]
 87:  995| [45] ["Then I guess she'll be okay if she stays out of any more contaminated zones, huh..."]
 88: 1000| [45] [But he couldn't be optimistic. It was very unlikely that she had a Procyon.]
 89: 1005| [45] [Ena continued talking.]
 90: 1031| [47] [Ena]
 91: 1034| [45] ["... She'll be fine. Truth be told, that girl's a prodigy who excels at almost everything."]
 92: 1042| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1045| [45] ["A prodigy?"]
 94: 1053| [47] [Ena]
 95: 1056| [45] ["Right. I just know she's the kind of girl who can figure out a way to survive by herself."]
 96: 1064| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1067| [45] ["I see... that definitely is... hopeful."]
 98: 1072| [45] [Even if it was only a faint hope-- Watase felt he should believe in it.]
 99: 1164| [45] [--The pair exited the connecting passageway and made it to the door to the control room.%NYuuri was waiting out there.]
100: 1232| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1235| [45] ["Um... did something... happen...?"]
102: 1262| [47] [Ena]
103: 1265| [45] ["... Looks like Captain Kasasagi here passed out right after he went into a contaminated zone."]
104: 1291| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1294| [45] ["You went to a contaminated zone?"]
106: 1299| [45] [Yuuri walked over to Watase with a look of shock adorning her face.]
107: 1325| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1328| [45] ["Why did you pass out...?"]
109: 1336| [47] [Watase]
110: 1339| [45] ["Well, I got this real bad headache all of a sudden... so I don't really remember it all that well..."]
111: 1347| [47] [Watase]
112: 1350| [45] ["But maybe it was some kind of radiation damage. Radiation can damage your brain cells, you see... 'least that's what Tachibana said..."]
113: 1376| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1379| [45] ["Oh no...!"]
115: 1384| [45] [Yuuri stared hard at Watase.]
116: 1392| [47] [Watase]
117: 1395| [45] ["... Are you worried about me?"]
118: 1423| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1426| [45] ["Huh...?"]
120: 1452| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1455| [45] ["... N-no."]
122: 1463| [47] [Watase]
123: 1466| [45] ["I see..."]
124: 1471| [45] [Yuuri's response was surprising, but also heartwarming.]
125: 1476| [45] [She'd been acting like she didn't want to go near Watase the whole time she'd been with them.]
126: 1481| [45] [He didn't know why that was-- but the concern she'd shown him just now seemed to be proof that she was becoming a bit more comfortable around him.]
127: 1486| [47] [Watase]
128: 1487| [45] [(Is it because of all the times I've risked my life...?)]
129: 1492| [45] [Watase then gave Yuuri a smile.]
130: 1519| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 1522| [45] ["Huh...?"]
132: 1527| [45] [Yuuri muttered that and looked down as if she were embarrassed.]
133: 1532| [47] [Watase]
134: 1533| [45] [(Oh boy, looks like she's still being a bit cautious with me...)]
135: 1538| [45] [But he still believed that Yuuri had been truly worried about him.]
136: 1546| [47] [Watase]
137: 1549| [45] ["... It's okay, Yuuri."]
138: 1557| [47] [Watase]
139: 1560| [45] ["This is just our way of life. We'd be out of a job if we made civilians, especially young girls, worry about us."]
140: 1586| [47] [Ena]
141: 1589| [45] ["Oh my, you're finally starting to sound like a man of your station, Captain Amnesia."]
142: 1597| [47] [Watase]
143: 1600| [45] ["Well, the amnesia aside, I still -am- a bona-fide rescue worker, you know. This is just my way of playing it cool."]
144: 1605| [45] [Just as he said that, it suddenly hit Watase.]
145: 1610| [45] [His subordinates were currently fighting the fires down on floor B2.]
146: 1618| [47] [Watase]
147: 1621| [45] ["... Crap, I should be helping Tachibana and Moribe out. You guys wait in the control room."]
148: 1647| [47] [Ena]
149: 1650| [45] ["Huh? A-are you sure you're okay? You only fainted just a few minutes ago."]
150: 1658| [47] [Watase]
151: 1661| [45] ["Yep, I'm already as good as new. So now I've gotta make up for lost ground."]
152: 1707| [47] [Ena]
153: 1710| [45] ["Sheesh, you're such a tough guy."]
154: 1715| [45] [Watase starting running off towards the emergency staircase as he heard Ena say that.]
