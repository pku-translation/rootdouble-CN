  1:   59| [45] [--They easily got through the reception desk.]
  2:   64| [45] [They were handed microphones and a remote as they made their way to their room.]
  3:   69| [45] [Natsuhiko hadn't personally been to this store, but he had heard rumors that their policy was lax.]
  4:  131| [45] [The room was of an old fashioned style that had been in use for over 20 years.]
  5:  136| [45] [But it was safe, and that was all that mattered.]
  6:  141| [45] [After one final check to make sure there were no surveillance cameras, the kids stretched wide.]
  7:  149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  152| [45] ["Whew... Good grief. I feel like a fugitive."]
  9:  193| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  196| [45] ["You okay, Salyu? Not tired?"]
 11:  266| [45] [As Mashiro asked her question, Salyu looked restlessly around the room.]
 12:  292| [47] [Salyu]
 13:  295| [45] ["Um... Natsuhiko, how do you sing here?"]
 14:  303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  306| [45] ["Huh? Salyu, you mean you want to sing?"]
 16:  332| [47] [Salyu]
 17:  335| [45] ["Yes. Quite interested."]
 18:  343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  346| [45] ["I'm not quite sure this is the most appropriate occasion to sing, though..."]
 20:  351| [45] [He was thinking it'd be better for them to sleep and let their bodies rest.]
 21:  377| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  380| [45] ["Well, why not, Natsuhiko? I'm sure Salyu's got some pent-up stress and anxiety from all that's happened today."]
 23:  388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  391| [45] ["You're too soft on her, Mashiro..."]
 25:  396| [45] [But Mashiro had a point. Natsuhiko reconsidered and spoke again.]
 26:  450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  453| [45] ["Okay, Salyu. First, you choose which song you want to sing using this remote."]
 28:  479| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  482| [45] ["Remote? This thing?"]
 30:  517| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  520| [45] ["Yes. If you press that button, the song list comes up, see..."]
 32:  546| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  549| [45] ["Like this...?"]
 34:  560| [45] [Under Mashiro's guidance, Salyu used the remote to bring up a list of songs.]
 35:  574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  575| [45] [(... Mashiro's helpful even at times like these, huh...)]
 37:  580| [45] [Even though she must've been worried, she still took care of Salyu.]
 38:  585| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke with Mashiro in the time before the song began.]
 39:  593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  596| [45] ["Mashiro, you're kind of like Salyu's older sister."]
 41:  622| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  625| [45] ["You're right. I'm happy to have gotten a new little sister, too."]
 43:  651| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  654| [45] ["I don't have any real siblings, so I've always dreamed of having one."]
 45:  659| [45] [In any case, it was a pleasant sight for Natsuhiko to see those two get along.]
 46:  671| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  674| [45] ["... Hmm, I guess this is Salyu's first karaoke experience, huh."]
 48:  700| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  703| [45] ["Mmm. I've experienced a lot of things for the first time since coming to this town. Though a lot of those experiences were today."]
 50:  708| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Salyu had followed Natsuhiko everywhere he went today without complaint.]
 51:  713| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  714| [45] [(I want to reward her with at least one -fun- experience like karaoke...)]
 53:  719| [45] [Natsuhiko harbored that thought in secret.]
 54:  727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  728| [45] [(... But still, these two girls are actually pretty tough.)]
 56:  733| [45] [Perhaps it was actually the girls who were adapting to the circumstances better than Natsuhiko was.]
 57:  738| [45] [Natsuhiko harbored that thought in secret.]
 58:  943| [45] [--And after a short while, the three of them sang songs in turn.]
 59:  948| [45] [Until they lost track of the time and felt satisfied.]
 60:  953| [45] [Along the way, Salyu became quite possessive of the microphone.]
 61:  979| [47] [Mashiro]
 62:  982| [45] ["Um, Salyu, can I sing next?"]
 63:  987| [45] [Even when Mashiro asked nicely, Salyu flat-out rejected her.]
 64: 1013| [47] [Salyu]
 65: 1016| [45] ["No. Five more songs."]
 66: 1042| [47] [Mashiro]
 67: 1045| [45] ["N-no way..."]
 68: 1053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1056| [45] ["Why not, Mashiro? You're the 'older sister' here, so let it slide."]
 70: 1082| [47] [Mashiro]
 71: 1085| [45] ["Yeah, but... I know, let's do a duet!"]
 72: 1090| [45] [They had small quibbles like that as they sang, but they smiled together.]
 73: 1095| [45] [It certainly may not have been the best time to sing.]
 74: 1100| [45] [And perhaps they were merely running away from the harsh reality outside.]
 75: 1105| [45] [But it was an unmistakable truth that the three of them enjoyed this time they had together.]
