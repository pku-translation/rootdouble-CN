  1:   23| [45] [The group headed from Area 4 to Area 3's inner ring.]
  2:   28| [45] [While en route, they looked over their newfound maps.]
  3:   75| [47] [Watase]
  4:   78| [45] ["Wow, this map really does make it easy to tell where you are!"]
  5:   86| [47] [Jun]
  6:   89| [45] ["Honestly, I've been having a lot of trouble telling where I've been up 'til now."]
  7:   94| [45] [They hurried as they talked.]
  8:  404| [45] [They were now in the connecting passageway from Area's 3 inner ring to its outer ring--%Nthe one whose door had failed to open earlier.]
  9:  537| [45] [Watase tried his security card just to be sure.]
 10:  542| [45] [But it didn't respond at all.]
 11:  585| [47] [Watase]
 12:  588| [45] ["... Yep, it's broken."]
 13:  596| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  599| [45] ["Then please go ahead, Mr. Ukita."]
 15:  607| [47] [Ukita]
 16:  610| [45] ["Right. I don't know what I'll be able to do, but I'll give it a try."]
 17:  615| [45] [Ukita took out the army knife and used it to start fiddling with the card slot.]
 18:  674| [47] [Watase]
 19:  677| [45] ["... Well, Mr. Ukita? Think you'll be able to do something?"]
 20:  703| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  706| [45] ["Mmm... it's hard to say. Even if I can, it might take time..."]
 22:  711| [45] ["Then maybe it'd be best to try the other route as well."]
 23:  737| [45] [Watase looked at Kazami as he thought that-- but she was rubbing her arms.]
 24:  745| [47] [Watase]
 25:  748| [45] ["... Tachibana, what's wrong?"]
 26:  783| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  786| [45] ["Oh, nothing... I just felt this tingling pain in my skin..."]
 28:  794| [47] [Watase]
 29:  797| [45] ["What!?"]
 30:  802| [45] [Watase started panicking.]
 31:  807| [45] [He hadn't realized it up until this point, but it'd been 45 minutes since their last injection of AD.]
 32:  812| [47] [Watase]
 33:  813| [45] [(What's Tachibana's cumulative exposure at now...?)]
 34:  818| [47] [Watase]
 35:  819| [45] [(If that damaged AD's effects didn't fully manifest, does that mean she can only handle under 2000 mSv?)]
 36:  824| [47] [Watase]
 37:  825| [45] [(But we don't even have a single AD on us right now. At this rate, we'll all...!)]
 38:  890| [47] [Jun]
 39:  893| [45] ["M-Mr. Ukita... can I try?"]
 40:  919| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  922| [45] ["Don't get impatient, Moribe. Let Mr. Ukita go at his own pa--"]
 42:  927| [45] [And as Kazami said that...]
 43:  932| [45] [Yuuri suddenly spoke up from behind them all.]
 44:  998| [47] [Yuuri]
 45: 1001| [45] ["Ah, there's smoke..."]
 46: 1009| [47] [Watase]
 47: 1012| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 48: 1017| [45] [Watase turned around as soon as he heard that.]
 49: 1025| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1028| [45] ["Smoke? Where?"]
 51: 1036| [47] [Yuuri]
 52: 1039| [45] ["Over there..."]
 53: 1044| [45] [Yuuri had just pointed to the center of the passageway when--]
 54: 1277| [47] [All]
 55: 1280| [45] ["!?"]
 56: 1285| [45] [The floorboards were blown away and fire came jetting out of them.]
 57: 1339| [47] [Watase]
 58: 1342| [45] ["Wha!? What the hell, how'd fire get all the way here!?"]
 59: 1422| [47] [Kazami]
 60: 1425| [45] ["Moribe! Get a hose ready!"]
 61: 1474| [47] [Jun]
 62: 1477| [45] ["Roger!"]
 63: 1482| [45] [There was a fire hydrant right by the gate.]
 64: 1487| [45] [Jun promptly took a fire hose out of it and handed the nozzle to Kazami.]
 65: 1540| [47] [Kazami]
 66: 1543| [45] ["Everyone, please get back!"]
 67: 1551| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1554| [45] ["Lieutenant! Water's coming now!"]
 69: 1559| [45] [Kazami turned to the advancing flames and began hosing them down.]
 70: 1616| [45] [However--]
 71: 1844| [45] [more floorboards were blown away.]
 72: 1849| [45] [One flame after another kept spurting out of them.]
 73: 1916| [47] [Kazami]
 74: 1919| [45] ["Khh, our way out is...!"]
 75: 1924| [45] [Even with Kazami in a weakened state, the flames were progressing slowly, so it seemed she was doing her best.]
 76: 1952| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1955| [45] ["*cough*..."]
 78: 1998| [47] [Jun]
 79: 2001| [45] ["Yuuri, get down! You guys too! You'll breathe in less smoke that way!"]
 80: 2093| [45] [Ena followed her advice and held Yuuri in her arms.]
 81: 2098| [45] [She then crouched down and started shouting.]
 82: 2166| [47] [Ena]
 83: 2169| [45] ["Mr. Ukita! Think it'll be much longer!?"]
 84: 2177| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 2180| [45] ["I'm trying! But--"]
 86: 2206| [47] [Ukita]
 87: 2209| [45] ["I-I'm sorry! I honestly don't know if I can do it...!"]
 88: 2235| [47] [Ena]
 89: 2238| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
 90: 2243| [45] [It wasn't just Ena; everyone was speechless.]
 91: 2269| [47] [Jun]
 92: 2272| [45] ["Fuck! If only this damn gate weren't here!"]
 93: 2283| [45] [Jun kicked the gate.]
 94: 2448| [45] [At that moment, debris fell from the ceiling.]
 95: 2457| [47] [Watase]
 96: 2460| [45] ["Hmm!?"]
 97: 2465| [45] [Watase looked up-- then stared intently at what lay there.]
 98: 2493| [47] [Watase & Jun]
 99: 2496| [45] ["An air duct!"]
100: 2507| [45] [Watase quickly scanned the path of the duct.]
101: 2512| [45] [It apparently went right over the gate and straight into the outer ring.]
102: 2517| [45] [He then remembered what Ukita had said earlier.]
103: 2522| [45] ["The air ducts have radioactive material filters set up all over in them. They block all potential routes to the surface and other areas."]
104: 2527| [47] [Watase]
105: 2528| [45] [(Then maybe there isn't a filter in there blocking the way to the outer ring!)]
106: 2536| [47] [Watase]
107: 2539| [45] ["Moribe! Can we go through that air duct!?"]
108: 2565| [47] [Jun]
109: 2568| [45] ["Worth a shot! We might be able to open the gate from the other side!"]
110: 2573| [45] [But the air duct was blocked by a grate.]
111: 2646| [47] [Jun]
112: 2649| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, give me the knife!"]
113: 2675| [47] [Ukita]
114: 2678| [45] ["Huh? O-okay!"]
115: 2683| [45] [Jun took the army knife from Ukita.]
116: 2709| [47] [Jun]
117: 2712| [45] ["I'll remove the grate and go to the other side!"]
118: 2720| [47] [Jun]
119: 2723| [45] ["My body's smaller than the Captain's, so I'm better suited for this role!"]
120: 2739| [47] [Watase]
121: 2742| [45] ["Okay, go! I'll give you a lift on my shoulders!"]
122: 2768| [47] [Jun]
123: 2771| [45] ["Right on!"]
124: 2782| [47] [Watase]
125: 2785| [45] ["No, I should--"]
126: 2811| [47] [Jun]
127: 2814| [45] ["You'll never make it with that massive body of yours! Anyway, give me a lift on your shoulders already!"]
128: 2822| [47] [Watase]
129: 2825| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
130: 2945| [45] [Watase then lifted Jun on his shoulders, allowing her to begin dismantling the grate.]
131: 2995| [45] [Screws soon began falling-- first one, then two, three, and four. Finally, the grate itself fell.]
132: 3000| [45] [--It had only taken a mere 30 seconds.]
133: 3008| [47] [Watase]
134: 3011| [45] ["Damn, that was fast!"]
135: 3024| [47] [Jun]
136: 3027| [45] ["Yeah, being handy's the best part about me!"]
137: 3083| [45] [Jun left those words behind as she climbed into the air duct in the blink of an eye.]
138: 3091| [47] [Watase]
139: 3094| [45] ["We're counting on you, Moribe...!"]
140: 3168| [45] [But the flames behind them had only grown fiercer during this time.]
141: 3194| [47] [Kazami]
142: 3197| [45] ["Khh...!"]
143: 3202| [45] [Kazami groaned in pain as heat waves surged from the fire.]
144: 3228| [47] [Ena]
145: 3231| [45] ["Ms. Moribe...! Please hurry!"]
146: 3236| [45] [Ena still had her arms wrapped around Yuuri.]
147: 3241| [45] [And as Watase also prayed for the same thing from the bottom of his heart--]
148: 3320| [45] [The security gate opened.]
149: 3362| [47] [Watase]
150: 3365| [45] ["Yes!"]
151: 3370| [45] [Joy filled the group's faces all at once.]
152: 3421| [45] [But something was strange.]
153: 3426| [45] [The other side of the gate was full of smoke, and Jun was nowhere to be seen.]
154: 3490| [47] [Watase]
155: 3493| [45] ["...!?"]
156: 3498| [45] [An ominous feeling took grip of Watase. So he quickly scanned the area--]
157: 3506| [47] [Watase]
158: 3509| [45] ["Moribe!!"]
159: 3514| [45] [--and spotted Jun lying on the floor.]
