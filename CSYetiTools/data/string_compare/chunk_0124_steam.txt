  1:   67| [45] [--It had already been nine hours since Watase had awoken with amnesia.]
  2:   72| [45] [He checked his watch to find that the time was "6:15 PM"--.]
  3:   77| [45] [It wouldn't be long before the lockdown was finally lifted.]
  4:  122| [45] [He finally arrived in front of the closed bulkhead that led to the surface.]
  5:  127| [45] [None of his five companions who he'd been through thick and thin with were accompanying him.]
  6:  132| [45] [Nor were any of the three children they'd all tried to save--]
  7:  140| [47] [Watase]
  8:  143| [45] ["It's finally over..."]
  9:  148| [45] [Indeed. The end of the nightmare was nigh.]
 10:  153| [45] [--What reality will be waiting for me when I wake up from this nightmare?]
 11:  158| [45] [Watase thought about that as he looked at the red lights shining on the bulkhead.]
 12:  163| [45] [That thought contained an unspeakable terror.]
 13:  168| [45] [But once that bulkhead opened, he could learn who the real "Watase Kasasagi" was.]
 14:  173| [45] [Was he a rescue worker, or a killer--?]
 15:  178| [45] [The answer to that would most likely become clear once the crimes that had occurred in LABO were examined by more unbiased eyes.]
 16:  183| [45] [And once they saw the many corpses that littered the place--]
 17:  886| [45] [Those thoughts ran through Watase's mind until...]
 18:  912| [47] [Watase]
 19:  915| [45] ["Wh-what the...!?"]
 20:  955| [47] [Watase]
 21:  958| [45] ["What's that sound...!?"]
 22:  966| [47] [Watase]
 23:  969| [45] ["Wha... what's going on...!?"]
 24:  974| [45] [A thunderous roar and vibrations rumbled at his feet and were closing in on him.]
 25: 1024| [45] [Watase then turned to the emergency staircase behind him--]
 26: 1029| [45] [--Only for shockwaves and heat to come surging forward with the roar!]
 27: 1158| [47] [Watase]
 28: 1161| [45] ["--!?"]
 29: 1299| [45] [--]
 30: 1304| [45] [----]
 31: 1323| [45] [--He could hear a sound echoing from somewhere.]
 32: 1331| [47] [Watase]
 33: 1334| [45] ["Ugh... ughh..."]
 34: 1339| [45] [Watase's consciousness was in a shattered world.]
 35: 1344| [45] [Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch... all of his senses had been ravaged.]
 36: 1349| [45] [His eyes were open, yet he could barely see anything.]
 37: 1354| [45] [He couldn't even tell how far away that sound was, much less what direction it was coming from.]
 38: 1359| [45] [The only thing that was clear to him was the stench of something burnt.]
 39: 1364| [45] [His sense of taste had completely vanished.]
 40: 1369| [45] [To top it all off, he couldn't move his body an inch--]
 41: 1374| [45] [He didn't even know if he still had limbs or not.]
 42: 1379| [45] [It didn't feel like there was a world around for him to experience at all.]
 43: 1391| [86] [???]
 44: 1392| [86] ["Stay on your guard, men!"]
 45: 1400| [85] ["Stay on your guard, men!"]
 46: 1457| [86] [???]
 47: 1458| [86] ["We don't know what happened in there! Report in as soon as you've confirmed the situation!"]
 48: 1466| [85] ["We don't know what happened in there! Report in as soon as you've confirmed the situation!"]
 49: 1486| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1487| [45] [(Wha... what just-- happ--... ened...?)]
 51: 1492| [45] [Light flooded into Watase's presently disconnected field of vision--]
 52: 1629| [47] [???]
 53: 1632| [45] ["Your top priority is securing the two test subjects! Don't forget to use NBC countermeasures!"]
 54: 1637| [47] [???]
 55: 1640| [45] ["Take anyone else you find and send them to Rokumei City Hospital, dead or alive!"]
 56: 1645| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1646| [45] [(Wha--... t? What are... they tal...--king about?)]
 58: 1651| [45] [Just then, Watase's blurry eyes caught sight of the letters "NBC" written on the men's protection suits.]
 59: 1656| [47] [???]
 60: 1659| [45] ["Sir! We've located a survivor! We'll bring him out stat!"]
 61: 1664| [45] [But the men started carrying him somewhere as the meaning of those letters remained a mystery to him.]
 62: 1716| [45] [Watase desperately rose his voice in the midst of the endless nightmare.]
 63: 1724| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1727| [45] ["Ugh, agh... agh...... agh..."]
 65: 1728| [85] [(What--... the hell... happened here... in LABO...?)]
 66: 1731| [86] [(What--... the hell... happened here... in LABO...?)]
 67: 1734| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1737| [45] ["Ugh... agh... ugh... agh..."]
 69: 1738| [85] [(In the end... just who in the world--...)]
 70: 1741| [86] [(In the end... just who in the world--...)]
 71: 1744| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1745| [45] [(Was the man... known as "Watase Kasasagi"...?)]
 73: 1750| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1753| [45] ["Ugh, agh... agh...... agh..."]
 75: 1754| [85] [(What--... the hell... happened here... in LABO...?)]
 76: 1757| [86] [(What--... the hell... happened here... in LABO...?)]
 77: 1760| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1761| [45] [(Someone... tell... me...!)]
 79: 1766| [45] [But all that emerged from Watase's throat were indecipherable groans of agony--]
 80: 1771| [45] [And soon enough... his consciousness began to fade away.]
