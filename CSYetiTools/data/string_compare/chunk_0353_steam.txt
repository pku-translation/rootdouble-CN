  1:   63| [45] [--After leaving the shelter, Natsuhiko borrowed Yuuri's shoulder, and together they reached Area 3.]
  2:   71| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   74| [45] ["Salyu! Where are you!?"]
  4:  100| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  103| [45] ["Salyu!"]
  6:  108| [45] [They called out Salyu's name to find her.]
  7:  113| [45] [Not much time had passed since Watase had encountered her around here.]
  8:  118| [45] [But if Watase had gotten away from her here, then there was no telling when they'd find her.]
  9:  123| [45] [And with that thought in mind, Natsuhiko searched around Area 3.]
 10:  174| [45] [Including the connecting passageway between the inner and outer rings.]
 11:  225| [45] [And the emergency stairs.]
 12:  280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  283| [45] ["Salyu, are you around!?"]
 14:  288| [45] [But they couldn't find her.]
 15:  296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  299| [45] ["Crap, where is she...?"]
 17:  325| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  328| [45] ["Maybe she went to another area..."]
 19:  333| [45] [But not a moment after they whispered that-- they heard her voice.]
 20:  372| [47] [Salyu]
 21:  375| [45] ["Natsuhiko!"]
 22:  398| [45] [They turned around. She was right there.]
 23:  406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  409| [45] ["Salyu!!"]
 25:  444| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  447| [45] ["Ahh... I finally found you...!"]
 27:  459| [45] [Salyu smiled in relief and dashed towards Natsuhiko.]
 28:  562| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  565| [45] ["Gwoh!!"]
 30:  570| [45] [Salyu's small head sank into Natsuhiko's solar plexus.]
 31:  576| [45] [But Salyu paid no attention and just kept nuzzling her head against him.]
 32:  605| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  608| [45] ["I was so worried. I thought that man might've killed you..."]
 34:  616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  619| [45] ["I-It's okay... I'm a little roughed up, but I'm alive."]
 36:  646| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  649| [45] ["Now that you mention it, how did you get here with those injuries?"]
 38:  657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  660| [45] ["Oh, I borrowed Yuuri's shoulder--"]
 40:  687| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  690| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
 42:  715| [45] [Apparently Salyu hadn't noticed Yuuri's presence until then.]
 43:  738| [45] [Salyu took a long hard look at her before murmuring in confusion.]
 44:  764| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  767| [45] ["'Yuuri'...? Your childhood friend?"]
 46:  793| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  796| [45] ["Y-yes."]
 48:  822| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  825| [45] ["... I am confused."]
 50:  851| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  854| [45] ["The professor told me Yuuri died nine years ago. And that you've been seeing a phantom of her ever since."]
 52:  862| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  865| [45] ["Oh, I see... Of course Mom would have you play along with my madness."]
 54:  873| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  876| [45] ["But Yuuri was actually alive."]
 56:  884| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  887| [45] ["For nine whole years, she's been trapped in this facility just like we are now."]
 58:  948| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  951| [45] ["...!?"]
 60:  956| [45] [His explanation only seemed to make Salyu more and more confused.]
 61:  961| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  962| [45] [(... I guess it's understandable. I mean, it confused the hell out of me too.)]
 63:  967| [45] [That was what Natsuhiko was thinking-- but immediately afterwards, Salyu said something completely unexpected.]
 64:  993| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  996| [45] ["Yuuri..."]
 66: 1022| [47] [Yuuri]
 67: 1025| [45] ["Wh... what is it?"]
 68: 1051| [47] [Salyu]
 69: 1054| [45] ["I feel... like I've seen you somewhere before..."]
 70: 1115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1118| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 72: 1123| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
 73: 1128| [45] [Even if she had heard about the phantom issue, Salyu shouldn't have been familiar with Yuuri's appearance, so how--!?]
 74: 1136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1139| [45] ["Wh-what do you mean!? Have you met before!?"]
 76: 1165| [47] [Salyu]
 77: 1168| [45] ["It might be my imagination, but... when I saw Yuuri, I felt somehow nostalgic..."]
 78: 1176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1179| [45] ["Wait... have you met her before, Yuuri?"]
 80: 1205| [47] [Yuuri]
 81: 1208| [45] ["N-no. I think it's just your imagination."]
 82: 1216| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1219| [45] ["...?"]
 84: 1245| [47] [Yuuri]
 85: 1248| [45] ["Since Hikorin's talked to you about me before, it just doesn't feel like this is the first time you've met me, that's all."]
 86: 1256| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1259| [45] ["Does that sound about right, Salyu?"]
 88: 1285| [47] [Salyu]
 89: 1288| [45] ["Mmm... That's probably it. I haven't come across you today, either."]
 90: 1296| [47] [Salyu]
 91: 1299| [45] ["And besides, the professor showed me a picture of you from nine years ago. It's probably because I saw that."]
 92: 1325| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1328| [45] ["Right... So allow me to introduce myself again."]
 94: 1333| [45] [Ignoring the perplexed Natsuhiko, Yuuri spoke to Salyu.]
 95: 1359| [47] [Yuuri]
 96: 1362| [45] ["Nice to meet you, Salyu. I've heard a lot about you from Hikorin."]
 97: 1388| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1391| [45] ["You want to see Mashiron, don't you? She's in Area 5, so we'll take you to her."]
 99: 1417| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1420| [45] ["O-Okay."]
101: 1425| [45] [Yuuri took Salyu by the hand and began to walk.]
102: 1451| [47] [Salyu]
103: 1454| [45] ["Then I'll carry Natsuhiko."]
104: 1462| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1465| [45] ["O-okay, thanks."]
106: 1490| [45] [He felt a little ashamed at having such a small girl carry him, but he didn't want to waste time debating it.]
107: 1495| [45] [So Natsuhiko quickly accepted the offer.]
108: 1543| [45] [They could head straight for Area 5 by taking a shortcut through Area N.]
109: 1659| [45] [And with that thought in mind, they passed through there.]
110: 1667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1670| [45] ["Salyu, are you okay? You don't feel bad anywhere?"]
112: 1696| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1699| [45] ["You mean because of the radiation?"]
114: 1707| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1710| [45] ["... Y-yeah."]
116: 1736| [47] [Salyu]
117: 1739| [45] ["I am fine. I injected AD about 40 minutes ago, so it should still be effective."]
118: 1765| [47] [Salyu]
119: 1768| [45] ["My head hurts a little, but it's nowhere near as bad as last time."]
120: 1773| [45] [That was probably because the WX particle energy levels were decreasing even in Area N.]
121: 1778| [45] [And then Natsuhiko suddenly remembered something.]
122: 1786| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1789| [45] ["Ah... hold on a second."]
124: 1799| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke up and got down from Salyu's back.]
125: 1825| [47] [Salyu]
126: 1828| [45] ["What is the matter?"]
127: 1854| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1857| [45] ["Is there a problem...?"]
129: 1865| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1868| [45] ["Well, Yuuri--"]
131: 1927| [45] [Natsuhiko gave Yuuri an eye signal and sent her telepathy.]
132: 1935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1938| [45] [{I want to check if Salyu's infected with malice or not, just to be completely sure.}]
134: 1962| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1965| [45] [{Huh?}]
136: 1970| [45] [Yuuri's face froze at that message.]
137: 1975| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1978| [45] [{Even if Salyu's under the influence of AD, BC should probably still work on her in here, right?}]
139: 1983| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1986| [45] [{I think we should do it while we've got the chance.}]
141: 1991| [45] [Area N had a reading of over 15000 mSv just two hours ago.]
142: 1996| [45] [So the reading was probably still over 4000 mSv.]
143: 2001| [45] [But Yuuri frantically shook her head.]
144: 2074| [47] [Yuuri]
145: 2077| [45] [{Th-there's no need, Hikorin! Don't you believe in Salyu!?}]
146: 2085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2088| [45] [{I do. But what's scary about that malice is that you aren't aware of it yourself, right?}]
148: 2093| [45] [Natsuhiko's thought was that they should just do it to make sure nothing was wrong, considering everything that could go wrong.]
149: 2117| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 2120| [45] [{Hmm... then let's just check to see if there are any "floral-scented memories" or not.}]
151: 2144| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2147| [45] [{That's all we need to do to know if she's infected with malice or not.}]
153: 2233| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2234| [45] [(...?)]
155: 2239| [45] [For some reason, Yuuri was being almost uncharacteristically obstinate.]
156: 2244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 2245| [45] [(What...? Why's Yuuri so against the idea of diving through Salyu's memories?)]
158: 2250| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2251| [45] [(Is there some sort of connection between Salyu and Yuuri...?)]
160: 2256| [45] [Once he pondered that question, suddenly--]
161: 2261| [45] [A vision of what he saw from within Ena's memory flashed before his eyes.]
162: 2322| [47] [Ena]
163: 2325| [45] ["This article's about... the 'Andresy Witch Hunt'!?"]
164: 2340| [45] [As well as a vision of the day Salyu transferred in.]
165: 2418| [47] [Salyu]
166: 2421| [45] ["I lived in Andresy."]
167: 2440| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2441| [45] [(...!!?)]
169: 2446| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2447| [45] [(Communicator A and Salyu are both from Andresy...!?)]
171: 2507| [45] [And when he looked at Salyu's face--]
172: 2624| [45] [--he felt she somewhat resembled Communicator A.]
173: 2629| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2630| [45] [(Huh... what...? What's the meaning of this?)]
175: 2635| [45] [He didn't understand the reason why, but he had a feeling it had something to do with Yuuri's odd behavior.]
176: 2640| [45] [Since Communicator A spent the last year of her life inside LABO--]
177: 2738| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2741| [45] [{H-hold on a second, Yuuri...}]
179: 2749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 2752| [45] [{There's something you know about Salyu that I don't, isn't there!?}]
181: 2811| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 2814| [45] [{...!}]
183: 2822| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2825| [45] [{Is there some sort of reason we shouldn't dive into Salyu's memories!?}]
185: 2849| [47] [Yuuri]
186: 2852| [45] [{N-no. It's just... we don't have time...}]
187: 2857| [45] [Yuuri fell silent.]
188: 2862| [45] [Salyu then interrupted.]
189: 2896| [47] [Salyu]
190: 2899| [45] ["... You two suddenly went quiet. What's wrong?"]
191: 2907| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2910| [45] ["Uh, well..."]
193: 2915| [45] [It was too hard to explain, so Natsuhiko just gave a noncommittal answer.]
194: 2923| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 2926| [45] ["It's just... there's something we need to do... and so Yuuri and I were discussing it via telepathy."]
196: 2952| [47] [Salyu]
197: 2955| [45] ["Telepathy? Yuuri's a Communicator too?"]
198: 2982| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 2985| [45] ["Y-yes, I am."]
200: 2993| [47] [Salyu]
201: 2996| [45] ["So can you use telepathy, and empathy, and...?"]
202: 3028| [47] [Yuuri]
203: 3031| [45] ["Just those two... well, there aren't any other BC abilities besides those two, right?"]
204: 3039| [47] [Salyu]
205: 3042| [45] ["I see..."]
206: 3047| [45] [Right after she said that-- Salyu took a deep breath.]
207: 3073| [47] [Salyu]
208: 3076| [45] ["... I've solved the mystery."]
209: 3102| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 3105| [45] ["Huh...?"]
211: 3131| [47] [Salyu]
212: 3134| [45] ["Actually, it's been bothering me a little. There are too many unnatural points about my past."]
213: 3142| [47] [Salyu]
214: 3145| [45] ["There are very few details in it despite there being 13 years worth of content."]
215: 3171| [47] [Salyu]
216: 3174| [45] ["Don't you think so too, Natsuhiko?"]
217: 3182| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 3185| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
219: 3190| [45] [True, Natsuhiko did find it somewhat bizarre that her parents wouldn't let their daughter out of the house at all, but--]
220: 3198| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 3201| [45] ["... What about it?"]
222: 3227| [47] [Salyu]
223: 3230| [45] ["I finally know the answer to the reason why that is."]
224: 3235| [45] [Salyu gazed at Yuuri and spoke.]
225: 3261| [47] [Salyu]
226: 3264| [45] ["Yuuri--"]
227: 3272| [47] [Salyu]
228: 3275| [45] ["You manipulated my memories, didn't you?"]
229: 3301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 3304| [45] ["--Wh... what?"]
231: 3309| [45] [Natsuhiko doubted his ears.]
232: 3317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3320| [45] ["S-she manipulated your memories...!?"]
234: 3328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3331| [45] ["Wh-when!? Wait, hold on, have you two even met before!?"]
236: 3336| [45] [Thoroughly confused, Natsuhiko looked to Yuuri.]
237: 3341| [45] [But she did not look particularly surprised.]
238: 3367| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 3370| [45] ["... Salyu, you remember?"]
240: 3396| [47] [Salyu]
241: 3399| [45] ["... Just a little bit."]
242: 3407| [47] [Salyu]
243: 3410| [45] ["When I saw your face, it sparked a memory."]
244: 3436| [47] [Salyu]
245: 3439| [45] ["A memory of September 9th, the day before I met Natsuhiko. "]
246: 3447| [47] [Salyu]
247: 3450| [45] ["The keyword 'memory manipulation'. Area Zero. Your room--"]
248: 3476| [47] [Salyu]
249: 3479| [45] ["I don't remember the details, but... I feel like I owe an irreparable debt to you."]
250: 3484| [45] [Salyu's words confused Natsuhiko even further.]
251: 3492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 3495| [45] ["Y-Yuuri... is what Salyu's saying... true?"]
253: 3500| [45] [Upon hearing that question, Yuuri nodded in resignation.]
254: 3526| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 3529| [45] ["... Yes."]
256: 3537| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 3540| [45] ["The truth is... I have falsified Salyu's memory once before."]
258: 3548| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3551| [45] ["Why...!?"]
260: 3577| [47] [Yuuri]
261: 3580| [45] ["There was no other way. There were things she needed to forget for her own sake..."]
262: 3606| [47] [Salyu]
263: 3609| [45] ["Yuuri, can you return those memories back to normal?"]
264: 3635| [47] [Yuuri]
265: 3638| [45] ["I can, but..."]
266: 3646| [47] [Yuuri]
267: 3649| [45] ["You might be better off not knowing, you know...?"]
268: 3690| [47] [Natsuhiko & Salyu]
269: 3693| [45] ["..."]
270: 3701| [47] [Yuuri]
271: 3704| [45] ["That's why I manipulated your memories in the first place, Salyu."]
272: 3712| [47] [Yuuri]
273: 3715| [45] ["Knowledge of the truth might do nothing but sadden you. Are you sure you want to know?"]
274: 3720| [45] [Salyu answered Yuuri's question on the spot.]
275: 3746| [47] [Salyu]
276: 3749| [45] ["It does not bother me. Please restore my memory."]
277: 3775| [47] [Salyu]
278: 3778| [45] ["I want to know the truth. I'd take that over living a lie."]
279: 3783| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered as he heard that statement.]
280: 3788| [45] [She was exactly right. Averting your eyes from the truth meant you could not move forward.]
281: 3793| [45] [Salyu needed to know the truth in the same way he did...]
282: 3801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 3804| [45] ["Then... should I leave it up to just you to dive into Salyu's memories this time, Yuuri?"]
284: 3833| [47] [Salyu]
285: 3836| [45] ["... No, I want you to see too, Natsuhiko."]
286: 3844| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 3847| [45] ["Huh?"]
288: 3873| [47] [Salyu]
289: 3876| [45] ["I have a vague feeling of what the details of my memories are... so I want to let you see them too."]
290: 3902| [47] [Salyu]
291: 3905| [45] ["And, if you don't mind... I want you to support me."]
292: 3913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
293: 3916| [45] ["...!"]
294: 3921| [45] [Salyu's honest words pierced Natsuhiko in the heart.]
295: 3948| [47] [Yuuri]
296: 3951| [45] ["... Hikorin, I want you to join in too."]
297: 3982| [47] [Yuuri]
298: 3985| [45] ["I want you to see what it is I've done... I want you to see our past."]
299: 3993| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 3996| [45] ["All... all right."]
