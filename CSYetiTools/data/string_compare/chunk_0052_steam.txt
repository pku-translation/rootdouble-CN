  1:  149| [45] [--The group had been guided by hope up until now.]
  2:  154| [45] [They'd had faith that there must be an escape route somewhere. That survivors must still live, awaiting rescue somewhere.]
  3:  159| [45] [And the cargo lift they'd found at the end of their search should have been their only escape route.]
  4:  164| [45] [But-- it had already been destroyed.]
  5:  169| [45] [There had never been any hope to begin with.]
  6:  174| [45] [Instead...]
  7:  179| [45] [... all they'd found there was the unidentified body of a girl.]
  8:  238| [45] [The group was frozen in total shock.]
  9:  243| [45] [Everyone had been struck speechless by this unforeseen turn of events.]
 10:  248| [45] [Soon enough, Kazami--]
 11:  312| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  315| [45] ["I... I'll run a vitals check on her..."]
 13:  320| [45] [--ran over to the girl with that declaration.]
 14:  325| [45] [She took off her Vital Checker and put it around the girl's wrist.]
 15:  492| [45] [All five lights shone a bright red.]
 16:  521| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  524| [45] ["Status all red..."]
 18:  529| [45] [She opened the girl's eyelids up wider and checked her pupils.]
 19:  537| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  540| [45] ["Her pupils have dilated..."]
 21:  545| [45] [Kazami laid the girl down and spoke.]
 22:  571| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  574| [45] ["Moribe, help me out. I'm going to perform CPR."]
 24:  601| [47] [Jun]
 25:  604| [45] ["R-right."]
 26:  662| [45] [Jun hurriedly sat down next to the girl.]
 27:  667| [45] [Kazami performed cardiac massage. 15 compressions.]
 28:  672| [45] [Jun performed artificial respiration. 2 rescue breaths.]
 29:  677| [45] [The girl didn't respond.]
 30:  682| [45] [Watase just stood there in blank amazement, unable to even do a thing.]
 31:  687| [45] [15 compressions.]
 32:  692| [45] [2 rescue breaths.]
 33:  697| [45] [The girl didn't respond.]
 34:  725| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  728| [45] ["... It's hopeless."]
 36:  733| [45] [Ukita kneeled beside the girl and muttered that.]
 37:  738| [45] [Kazami and Jun ignored him and continued their CPR.]
 38:  743| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 39:  751| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  754| [45] ["She's already dead..."]
 41:  759| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 42:  767| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  770| [45] ["You guys couldn't save her..."]
 44:  775| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 45:  801| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  804| [45] ["... And neither could I..."]
 47:  809| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 48:  814| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 49:  819| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 50:  824| [45] [Kazami didn't stop the CPR.]
 51:  853| [47] [Watase]
 52:  856| [45] ["Tachibana, it's too late...!"]
 53:  861| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  862| [45] ["..."]
 55:  867| [45] [Watase's words didn't seem to register with Kazami.]
 56:  878| [45] [Eventually, her watch alarm went off.]
 57:  887| [47] [Watase]
 58:  890| [45] ["!! Tachibana, it's time to administer the AD!"]
 59:  895| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  896| [45] ["..."]
 61:  904| [47] [Watase]
 62:  907| [45] ["Hey, are you listening!?"]
 63:  912| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  913| [45] ["..."]
 65:  921| [47] [Watase]
 66:  924| [45] ["... Khh...!"]
 67:  971| [45] [Watase took out one of the AD ampules and administered it to himself.]
 68: 1016| [45] [He then injected Ena and Yuuri with two other ampules.]
 69: 1021| [45] [Yuuri was so out of it that she didn't even offer up one of her usual protests.]
 70: 1066| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1069| [45] ["Come on Tachibana, you guys have to take some too!"]
 72: 1074| [45] [Kazami didn't reply.]
 73: 1079| [45] [But her lips faintly moved.]
 74: 1105| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1108| [45] ["... ie..."]
 76: 1116| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1119| [45] ["Nagisa, don't die...!"]
 78: 1124| [45] [Jun's eyes widened at that moment.]
 79: 1150| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1153| [45] ["S-Sis...!"]
 81: 1161| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1164| [45] ["This girl isn't Nagisa...!"]
 83: 1169| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1170| [45] [(Nagisa...!?)]
 85: 1175| [45] [Confusion swept over Watase.]
 86: 1180| [45] [Kazami didn't listen and continued her CPR attempts.]
 87: 1206| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1209| [45] ["Lieutenant! Stop it already!"]
 89: 1235| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1238| [45] ["!"]
 91: 1243| [45] [Kazami finally stopped moving at the sound of Jun's cry.]
 92: 1251| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1254| [45] ["... Tachibana..."]
 94: 1259| [45] [He couldn't say any more.]
 95: 1264| [45] [Kazami quietly turned around towards Watase and spoke.]
 96: 1290| [47] [Kazami]
 97: 1293| [45] ["I did everything within my power..."]
 98: 1301| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1304| [45] ["... But she's... dead."]
100: 1309| [45] [Kazami muttered that.]
101: 1369| [45] [Her face seemed absolutely devoid of life.]
102: 1374| [45] [The rest of the group chose that moment to speak up in terrified voices.]
103: 1430| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1433| [45] ["U-um, Lieutenant Tachibana...?"]
105: 1441| [47] [Ena]
106: 1444| [45] ["Er... are you okay?"]
107: 1452| [47] [Kazami]
108: 1455| [45] ["I apologize for causing you all concern. I'm all right now."]
109: 1460| [45] [Her tone of voice and the look on her face were the same as always-- and full of a harshness that wouldn't accept any further questions.]
110: 1503| [47] [Watase]
111: 1504| [45] [(What the hell just happened...?)]
112: 1509| [45] [Kazami had clearly been acting strange.]
113: 1514| [45] [But her attitude made it clear that she would reject any questions regarding the reason for her actions.]
114: 1519| [45] [However, there was one thing they all knew for sure.]
115: 1524| [47] [Watase]
116: 1525| [45] [(There's been... yet another victim...!)]
117: 1530| [45] [The group left the room, their hearts full of melancholy.]
118: 1536| [45] [They left the girl's body where it was--]
119: 1546| [86] [Kazami]
120: 1547| [86] ["... Um, hello?"]
121: 1557| [85] ["... Um, hello?"]
