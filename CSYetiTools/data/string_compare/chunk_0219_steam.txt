  1:   23| [45] [The building was surrounded by a tall fence with a giant gate.]
  2:   28| [45] [The kids climbed over the fence and infiltrated the premises.]
  3:   74| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   77| [45] ["... Looks like we're here."]
  5:  114| [45] [Before their eyes was a gigantic building.]
  6:  119| [45] [LABO-- the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization.]
  7:  124| [45] [The place where Natsuhiko and Yuuri had suffered their permanent emotional scars.]
  8:  187| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  190| [45] ["... It sure is quiet."]
 10:  217| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  220| [45] ["It seems like the terrorist attack hasn't started yet."]
 12:  228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  231| [45] ["Yeah...!"]
 14:  236| [45] [Natsuhiko answered in a stiff voice.]
 15:  241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  242| [45] [(Dammit, I knew it would happen, but...!)]
 17:  247| [45] [Just looking at the building made him break out in goosebumps and a cold sweat.]
 18:  252| [45] [His fear from 9 years ago was alive and well.]
 19:  257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  258| [45] [(... Put up with it. You can overcome this.)]
 21:  263| [45] [--The moment he thought that, a sharp voice rang out from a short distance away.]
 22:  268| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 23:  271| [45] ["What are you kids doing here!? This is a restricted area!"]
 24:  276| [45] [They saw two men who seemed to be security guards rushing up to them from LABO.]
 25:  281| [45] [They were slinging what appeared to be machine guns off their shoulders.]
 26:  304| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  307| [45] ["Ah, uh-- um...!"]
 28:  312| [45] [Mashiro stepped back in fear to see them.]
 29:  317| [45] [But Natsuhiko stepped up as if to cover for Mashiro and Salyu as he answered the security guards.]
 30:  325| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  328| [45] ["Please, wait. I'm Natsuhiko Tenkawa, the son of senior researcher Miyoko Tenkawa."]
 32:  333| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 33:  336| [45] ["... What?"]
 34:  341| [45] [The younger security guard looked dubious as Natsuhiko showed them his student ID and continued.]
 35:  349| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  352| [45] ["I came here to see my mother on urgent business. Can you call her for me?"]
 37:  357| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 38:  360| [45] ["What kind of business?"]
 39:  368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  371| [45] ["... A life-or-death family crisis."]
 41:  379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  382| [45] ["I haven't been able to contact my mother since yesterday... so I had no choice but to come here directly."]
 43:  387| [45] [Natsuhiko came up with a lie.]
 44:  392| [45] [And as he did so, he desperately tried to use empathy.]
 45:  397| [45] [But just then-- telepathy from Mashiro came soaring into his head.]
 46:  420| [47] [Mashiro]
 47:  423| [45] [{Natsuhiko, I can't read their minds...! They aren't opening up their hearts to us.}]
 48:  428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  429| [45] [(Yeah, I can understand why...)]
 50:  434| [45] [Regardless if the security guards were sleeper agents or not, it was only expected that they wouldn't open their hearts to some high school kids who suddenly appeared in a restricted area.]
 51:  439| [45] [They stared at the kids.]
 52:  444| [45] [Eventually the younger security guard whispered to the older one.]
 53:  449| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 54:  452| [45] ["... Should I call Dr. Tenkawa?"]
 55:  457| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 56:  460| [45] ["... Mmm... hmm..."]
 57:  465| [45] [Suddenly, raindrops started falling from the sky.]
 58:  518| [47] [Mashiro]
 59:  521| [45] ["Ah..."]
 60:  534| [45] [Before they knew it, the sky became covered in clouds and it started to rain.]
 61:  539| [45] [The security guards looked up at the sky in frustration.]
 62:  544| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 63:  547| [45] ["Rain, huh... well, fine."]
 64:  552| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 65:  555| [45] ["We'll bring you to the entrance. Wait for Dr. Tenkawa there."]
 66:  563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  566| [45] ["O... okay!"]
 68:  571| [45] [The kids secretly clenched their fists in glee at those words.]
 69:  618| [45] [--The kids were taken to the entrance.]
 70:  623| [45] [The older security guard spoke up.]
 71:  628| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 72:  631| [45] ["I'll call the professor. Wait here for a little bit."]
 73:  642| [45] [He disappeared behind an iron door further down the entrance.]
 74:  647| [45] [The younger security guard stayed behind with the kids.]
 75:  656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  659| [45] ["... You can't take us to her?"]
 77:  664| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 78:  667| [45] ["People from the outside can only come in to this entrance area."]
 79:  672| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 80:  675| [45] ["There are 'security gates' set up around the facility that prevent you from entering unless you have a corresponding card."]
 81:  680| [45] [The man glanced at the iron door.]
 82:  685| [45] [Beside the door was what appeared to be a card swiping slot.]
 83:  711| [47] [Salyu]
 84:  714| [45] ["Where is Dr. Tenkawa?"]
 85:  719| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 86:  722| [45] ["Somewhere in the basement floors, I suppose. But security is even tougher on the bottom floors than the ground floors, so it's strictly off-limits to ordinary people."]
 87:  727| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 88:  730| [45] ["Depending on the situation, you could even be shot and apprehended without warning."]
 89:  735| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 90:  738| [45] ["So if you understand what's best for you, you'd wait here."]
 91:  743| [45] [If security was that severe, then terrorists probably wouldn't be able to get in.]
 92:  748| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93:  749| [45] [(But we can't let our guards down. We don't know how the enemy plans to invade, after all...!)]
 94:  754| [45] [As Natsuhiko considered that possibility, he received telepathy from Mashiro.]
 95:  830| [85] [{We can't afford to waste time, right...?]
 96:  832| [85] [Should we take this opportunity to send telepathy to the professor?}]
 97:  833| [86] [Mashiro]
 98:  834| [86] [{We can't afford to waste time, right...? Should we take this opportunity to send telepathy to the professor?}]
 99:  862| [45] [Natsuhiko was taken aback, but he nodded at Mashiro.]
100:  937| [85] [{Roger... in that case, I'll try sending it.}]
101:  938| [86] [Mashiro]
102:  939| [86] [{Roger... in that case, I'll try sending it.}]
103:  967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104:  968| [45] [(Yeah, I'll try too.)]
105: 1016| [45] [Natsuhiko concentrated his mind.]
106: 1047| [45] [He imagined his mother's characteristic brain waveform in his head.]
107: 1052| [45] [She had told him herself once before. She was a Type 4, just like Salyu.]
108: 1057| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1058| [45] [(There's something I need to tell Mom...)]
110: 1063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1064| [45] [(I've never needed this ability any more than I do now. So of course I'll be able to use telepathy!)]
112: 1070| [45] [The moment he made that conviction, Natsuhiko's five senses suddenly faded.]
113: 1075| [45] [He could feel his message leave his head as it emitted from his brain.]
114: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1247| [45] [{--Mom, can you hear me!? It's me, Natsuhiko!}]
116: 1255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1258| [45] [{We're in LABO's ground floor entrance.}]
118: 1266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1269| [45] [{We came here for reasons related to what we told you about yesterday.}]
120: 1277| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1280| [45] [{That is, terrorism-- There's a possibility that Q is targeting this facility.}]
122: 1288| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1291| [45] [{Q's objective is to destroy this town. That's why they're targeting this facility's nuclear reactor.}]
124: 1299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1302| [45] [{To make matters worse, there's possibly a sleeper agent in this facility. It could be Mr. Ukita or someone else...}]
126: 1310| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1313| [45] [{No matter how strictly precautions are taken, no matter how high security is, if there is a sleeper agent present, then the terrorist plot could succeed.}]
128: 1321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1324| [45] [{So please, Mom... Take all personnel outside of the facility right away and don't let anyone inside.}]
130: 1332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 1335| [45] [{I know I'm asking the impossible. But there's no other way!}]
132: 1488| [45] [--Once he had focused that far, his five senses returned.]
133: 1493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1494| [45] [(... All right!)]
135: 1499| [45] [Natsuhiko was confident he successfully invoked telepathy.]
136: 1504| [45] [And right after that, he received telepathy from Mashiro.]
137: 1580| [85] [{Hey, Natsuhiko, I sent Dr. Tenkawa telepathy...]
138: 1582| [85] [But I can't sense that it got to her.}]
139: 1583| [86] [Mashiro]
140: 1584| [86] [{Hey, Natsuhiko, I sent Dr. Tenkawa telepathy... But I can't sense that it got to her.}]
141: 1615| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1618| [45] ["Huh? How can you tell?"]
143: 1623| [45] [The security guard looked at Natsuhiko suspiciously after he inadvertently spoke out loud.]
144: 1628| [47] [Security Guard 2]
145: 1631| [45] ["Hmm? Tell what?"]
146: 1639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1642| [45] ["Ah, no, it's nothing."]
148: 1647| [45] [As Natsuhiko panicked to smooth things over, Mashiro continued with telepathy.]
149: 1704| [85] [{Once you get used to it, you can use empathy to confirm successful transmission.}]
150: 1705| [86] [Mashiro]
151: 1706| [86] [{Once you get used to it, you can use empathy to confirm successful transmission.}]
152: 1739| [85] [{But something's odd... There's no response at all.}]
153: 1740| [86] [Mashiro]
154: 1741| [86] [{But something's odd... There's no response at all.}]
155: 1769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1770| [45] [(What!? Did something happen to Mom!?)]
157: 1830| [45] [Natsuhiko was hit by an unpleasant premonition as he looked towards the entrance.]
158: 1835| [45] [--And then, suddenly--]
159: 1869| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 1872| [45] ["!!"]
161: 1877| [45] [Memories from nine years ago came back in his mind.]
162: 1982| [45] [--It was July 7, 2021.]
163: 1987| [45] [The memory of when he and Yuuri had sneaked into this facility.]
164: 1992| [45] [At the time, security was lax.]
165: 1997| [45] [They had stowed away on a transport truck and hid behind a security guard to get into the entrance.]
166: 2057| [45] [All staff seemed to be underground as there was no human presence in the entrance.]
167: 2065| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2068| [45] ["Hmm, so this is LABO, huh."]
169: 2073| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around and beside him, Yuuri whispered.]
170: 2081| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2084| [45] ["H-hey, Hikorin... we need to be more sneaky."]
172: 2092| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2095| [45] ["What are you talking about, Yuuri? You agreed to do this, didn't you?"]
174: 2103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 2106| [45] ["We said we'd save Mom since she's always being swamped with work."]
176: 2132| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 2135| [45] ["Y-yeah, I know, but..."]
178: 2140| [45] [That was the reason Natsuhiko and Yuuri had sneaked into LABO.]
179: 2145| [45] [At the time, Dr. Tenkawa was already a core member of the LABO research team and would always work late into the night.]
180: 2150| [45] [In Natsuhiko's eyes, she looked like she was being forced to work.]
181: 2158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 2161| [45] ["This is a mission of justice to save Mom."]
183: 2169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2172| [45] ["So we need to carry ourselves with dignity."]
185: 2198| [47] [Yuuri]
186: 2201| [45] ["But... they'll get mad at us if we get caught."]
187: 2209| [47] [Natsuhiko]
188: 2212| [45] ["You're such a scaredy-cat. C'mon, let's go. You can hold my hand."]
189: 2253| [45] [Natsuhiko gripped Yuuri's hand tight and walked farther inside.]
190: 2266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2269| [45] ["Mom told me that she works in the basement in Area 5."]
192: 2277| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2280| [45] ["She said it's a place only top professors can go."]
194: 2306| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 2309| [45] ["So first we need to find a staircase that goes to the basement, huh."]
196: 2317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 2320| [45] ["It's gotta be behind that door. Let's go, Yuuri."]
198: 2325| [45] [And back then, their path was blockaded by an iron door as well.]
199: 2333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2336| [45] ["Huh... It won't open."]
201: 2362| [47] [Yuuri]
202: 2365| [45] ["How do you think we open it...?"]
203: 2370| [45] [--How would they open it?]
204: 2375| [45] [Why were they able to to the basement back then?]
205: 2380| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko pondered that detail--!]
206: 2538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 2541| [45] ["... Ghh!?"]
208: 2546| [45] [An intense shock suddenly ran through his head, interrupting his thoughts.]
209: 2551| [47] [Security Guard 2]
210: 2554| [45] ["Hmm?"]
211: 2559| [45] [He heard the security guard's dubious voice coming from far away.]
212: 2564| [45] [Natsuhiko leaned against a wall, unable to stand the intense pain.]
213: 2605| [47] [Salyu]
214: 2608| [45] ["--Natsuhiko!?"]
215: 2616| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 2619| [45] ["What's wrong!? Do you feel bad!?"]
217: 2627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2630| [45] ["M... my head...!"]
219: 2635| [45] [He felt as if something were clamping down on his head.]
220: 2640| [45] [It happened when he tried to remember what happened nine years ago.]
221: 2645| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2646| [45] [(Why...!? Why does my head hurt so much!?)]
223: 2651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2652| [45] [(... No, I don't care! I need to remember!)]
225: 2657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2658| [45] [(Something's off here, isn't it!? Even if the security system has changed from how it was in the past, the structure of the facility itself wouldn't change too, would it!?)]
227: 2663| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 2664| [45] [(Why were we able to go to the basement!?)]
229: 2669| [45] [Back then, neither Natsuhiko nor Yuuri had a security card.]
230: 2674| [45] [And yet when they messed around with the card slot in an attempt to open the door--]
231: 2679| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 2680| [45] [(... That's right.)]
233: 2685| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 2686| [45] [(If I'm not mistaken, back then, there was an alarm...!)]
235: 2691| [45] [As he tried to remember, another headache struck!]
236: 2725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2728| [45] ["Guh, uugh, uuugghh....!"]
238: 2733| [45] [Natsuhiko staggered, unable to bear it.]
239: 2776| [45] [--And that moment--]
240: 2915| [45] [He heard a tremendous roar beneath his feet.]
