  1:    5| [47] [Watase]
  2:    6| [45] [(This isn't normal...!)]
  3:   11| [45] [His inner doubts began rapidly piling up.]
  4:   16| [45] [Something was off. Something about this wasn't right.]
  5:   21| [47] [Watase]
  6:   22| [45] [(What is it? Did Yuuri do something to me?)]
  7:   27| [47] [Watase]
  8:   28| [45] [(----!?)]
  9:   33| [47] [Watase]
 10:   34| [45] [("Did Yuuri do something to me"? What the hell's wrong with me!?)]
 11:   39| [45] [Watase was confused by his own baseless thoughts.]
 12:   44| [45] [Just then, a memory flashed through his brain--]
 13:  140| [45] [A memory of a mere few minutes ago.]
 14:  148| [47] [Yuuri]
 15:  151| [45] ["--...--...--...--"]
 16:  156| [45] [He'd found Yuuri in the elevator hall. She'd been saying something to him.]
 17:  161| [45] [But oddly enough, he couldn't remember what it was.]
 18:  166| [45] [Yuuri eventually walked over towards him calmly--]
 19:  236| [45] [--and that was it. Everything after that had up and vanished.]
 20:  241| [45] [No, that wasn't it. Even the memory Watase had just remembered was a "total mystery" to him.]
 21:  246| [47] [Watase]
 22:  247| [45] [(Wha... I lost that memory without even being aware of it...?)]
 23:  252| [47] [Watase]
 24:  253| [45] [(No way, could that have happened when my memories got muddled up a minute ago...!?)]
 25:  258| [45] [But there was one other thing he didn't understand.]
 26:  263| [45] [Why had Yuuri been so calm when she was hanging around in a contaminated zone?]
 27:  268| [45] [A mysterious anxiety burst into Watase's heart.]
 28:  273| [47] [Watase]
 29:  274| [45] [(Could it be... that Yuuri isn't affected by radiation...?)]
 30:  279| [45] [Even he knew that was an utterly insane idea.]
 31:  284| [45] [But something inside Watase was asserting that belief.]
 32:  289| [47] [Watase]
 33:  290| [45] [(If she's immune to radiation--)]
 34:  295| [45] [And the fact that there was a blank in Watase's memories of the previous time he'd been in the elevator hall meant--!]
 35:  300| [47] [Watase]
 36:  301| [45] [(--Could Yuuri still be lurking around in the contaminated zone!?)]
 37:  306| [45] [Watase came to that conclusion and quickly backtracked to B2.]
 38:  355| [45] [He suffered a horrific headache the moment he returned to the contaminated zone.]
 39:  360| [45] [Watase then became sure of it:]
 40:  365| [45] [There was no way a frail girl like Yuuri could have ever put up with a headache like that.]
 41:  370| [47] [Watase]
 42:  371| [45] [(Then that means she really is...!)]
 43:  376| [47] [Watase]
 44:  377| [45] [(But if that's the case, then what in the world -is- Yuuri...!?)]
 45:  382| [45] [If there really was a person unaffected by radiation, then they were probably something not human.]
 46:  431| [47] [Watase]
 47:  432| [45] [(--Remember!)]
 48:  437| [45] [Watase kept on commanding himself to remember with all his might as he searched the contaminated zone.]
 49:  442| [45] [He felt that the answer lied somewhere in his vanished memories.]
 50:  447| [45] [His headache grew much worse at that very moment.]
 51:  452| [45] [But Watase gritted his teeth and desperately searched his memories.]
 52:  526| [47] [Watase]
 53:  527| [45] [(That's right... I found Yuuri in the elevator hall back then...)]
 54:  532| [47] [Watase]
 55:  533| [45] [(She then stretched her palm out to me, and then...)]
 56:  661| [47] [Watase]
 57:  662| [45] [(That's right... I got scared...!)]
 58:  667| [47] [Watase]
 59:  668| [45] [(Because I saw Yuuri... and that monster... as one and the same...!)]
 60:  673| [45] [Watase remembered that-- but just then...]
 61:  750| [47] [Watase]
 62:  753| [45] ["Ghh, agh..."]
 63:  830| [47] [Watase]
 64:  833| [45] ["GAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHH!"]
 65:  838| [45] [Watase held his head and screamed.]
 66:  843| [45] [His brain was being assaulted by a head-splitting headache.]
 67:  848| [45] [It was at that moment that Watase remembered...]
 68:  853| [45] [... that he'd been experiencing the same kind of agony just a short while ago.]
 69:  858| [47] [Watase]
 70:  859| [45] [(This is the radiation's--!!)]
 71:  864| [45] [But by the time he realized it, it was too late.]
 72:  869| [45] [The pain churned the inside of his brain. His brain itself hit its limit, and his brain cells tore apart.]
 73:  874| [45] [--I'm breaking apart!]
 74:  951| [47] [Watase]
 75:  954| [45] ["OWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"]
 76:  959| [45] [He couldn't stop screaming.]
 77:  964| [45] [He heard the sound of his capillaries snapping apart in his head.]
 78:  969| [45] [Blood then poured out of his nose.]
 79: 1019| [45] [His eyes and ears then suffered the same fate--!]
 80: 1024| [45] [But suddenly--]
 81: 1073| [45] [--everything vanished from Watase's world.]
 82: 1078| [45] [From light, to sound, to his screams, and even the pain ravishing his brain.]
 83: 1083| [45] [That's right, everything...]
 84: 1088| [45] [... even the memories that made Watase who he was...]
 85: 1093| [45] [Vanished.]
 86: 1098| [45] [Disappeared into thin air.]
 87: 1103| [45] [Became indecipherable.]
 88: 1108| [45] [No, there was one thing that was clear.]
 89: 1113| [45] [His brain had been completely destroyed.]
 90: 1118| [45] [And then-- his world became one of nothingness.]
