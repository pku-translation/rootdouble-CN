  0:   60| [45] [--Watase's life as a rescue worker continued.]
  1:   65| [45] [He'd been on more dispatches than he could count, saving many lives along the way.]
  2:   70| [45] [It was by no means an easy life, but it was one he eventually got used to.]
  3:   75| [45] [Now in his early 30s, he was a man of extremely sound mind that had no disturbances in his life.]
  4:  150| [45] [--It was a warm day.]
  5:  155| [45] [Watase finished his shift and took a walk around the city at dusk with his mind at total peace.]
  6:  160| [45] [There had been a lot of peaceful days like this recently with no dispatches.]
  7:  165| [47] [Watase]
  8:  166| [45] [(Hmm, why do I feel a bit unsatisfied...?)]
  9:  171| [47] [Watase]
 10:  172| [45] [(I mean, I never would have dreamed that there'd ever be days like this back then.)]
 11:  220| [45] [His job and coworkers had supported him all this way.]
 12:  225| [45] [Among those coworkers, there were two of them who had similar backgrounds as Watase.]
 13:  230| [45] [They were "Seiji Dojima" and "Kazuki Hiyama".]
 14:  235| [45] [Much like him, they had also lost family and loved ones in the Great Arson and had been brought up in the city.]
 15:  240| [45] [They had all become rescue workers for similar motives and were all close in age, so the three of them got along very well.]
 16:  245| [45] [He had been blessed with coworkers whom he could pour his heart out to, a job he that was worth doing-- and on top of that, a subordinate who loved him dearly.]
 17:  250| [45] [He'd often been thinking recently that his life wasn't so bad after all.]
 18:  308| [45] [Just as he returned to his apartment and finished changing, his PDA rang.]
 19:  316| [47] [Watase]
 20:  319| [45] ["...?"]
 21:  324| [45] [The display read "Caller Unknown".]
 22:  337| [45] [Watase hesitated for a moment, then picked up the phone.]
 23:  345| [47] [???]
 24:  348| [45] ["Mr. Watase Kasasagi, I presume?"]
 25:  359| [45] [He heard a man's voice on the other end.]
 26:  364| [45] [His voice sounded somewhat mechanical, like it was being filtered through a voice changer.]
 27:  372| [47] [Watase]
 28:  375| [45] ["Umm... who is this?"]
 29:  383| [47] [???]
 30:  386| [45] ["I'm not one to give away my name. The truth is, there is something I'd like to tell you."]
 31:  394| [47] [Watase]
 32:  397| [45] ["Huh? Me?"]
 33:  402| [45] [The man started talking dispassionately just as Watase was ready to fully write this off as a prank.]
 34:  410| [47] [???]
 35:  413| [45] ["I apologize, but we've looked into you."]
 36:  421| [47] [Watase]
 37:  424| [45] ["Huh?"]
 38:  432| [47] [???]
 39:  435| [45] ["Watase Kasasagi, age 31. Lost your family in the 'Great Rokumei City Arson' 15 years ago."]
 40:  443| [47] [???]
 41:  446| [45] ["After that, you were taken under the protection of Rokumei City and moved into municipal housing."]
 42:  454| [47] [???]
 43:  457| [45] ["You enrolled in firefighting school after graduating high school. After graduating that, you were assigned to the Rokumei City Fire Department."]
 44:  465| [47] [???]
 45:  468| [45] ["You quickly stuck out amongst your peers and passed the rescue worker exam two years later. You then enlisted in Sirius..."]
 46:  476| [47] [???]
 47:  479| [45] ["I know it must have been tough for you to lose your family, but you avoided lashing out and grew up to be an honest man."]
 48:  502| [47] [Watase]
 49:  505| [45] ["...!"]
 50:  510| [45] [Shivers ran down Watase's spine.]
 51:  515| [45] [For he didn't know for what reason his caller would run a background check on him.]
 52:  523| [47] [Watase]
 53:  526| [45] ["... What the hell are you, some kind of stalker?"]
 54:  534| [47] [Watase]
 55:  537| [45] ["Stalking other men? You sure have some sick hobbies."]
 56:  545| [47] [???]
 57:  548| [45] ["It's not a hobby. There's a reason I looked into you."]
 58:  556| [47] [???]
 59:  559| [45] ["It's because you're an unfortunate victim of the Great Arson."]
 60:  567| [47] [Watase]
 61:  570| [45] ["... Don't talk about that. I don't want to hear that kind of stuff from other people."]
 62:  578| [47] [???]
 63:  581| [45] ["You are indeed probably tired of hearing people offer their sympathies for the loss of your family. I can understand why you don't want to talk about this--"]
 64:  589| [47] [???]
 65:  592| [45] ["But what if I told you that your family didn't die just because of some arson?"]
 66:  600| [47] [Watase]
 67:  603| [45] ["... What?"]
 68:  608| [45] [Watase gasped.]
 69:  616| [47] [Watase]
 70:  619| [45] ["Hold on, what the hell's that supposed to mean!?"]
 71:  627| [47] [???]
 72:  630| [45] ["Let me make one thing clear in advance. If you learn the truth, your life will probably change forever."]
 73:  653| [47] [Watase]
 74:  656| [45] ["...!"]
 75:  664| [47] [???]
 76:  667| [45] ["If you treasure your current life, then hang up now."]
 77:  675| [47] [???]
 78:  678| [45] ["Then everything will stay the way it is. You can go back to your peaceful life."]
 79:  686| [47] [???]
 80:  689| [45] ["But if you still wish to know the truth-- then come to the ruins of the Old Rokumei City Hospital. Alone."]
 81:  700| [45] [And with those last words, the caller hung up.]
 82:  708| [47] [Watase]
 83:  711| [45] ["H-hey!"]
 84:  716| [45] [There was no response from his PDA no matter how much he yelled at it.]
 85:  776| [45] [Watase stood in a daze for a while in his apartment.]
 86:  781| [47] [Watase]
 87:  782| [45] [(The ruins of the Old Rokumei City Hospital...? What "truth" is he talking about?)]
 88:  790| [47] [Watase]
 89:  793| [45] ["... Dammit..."]
 90:  798| [45] [His desire to know the truth and his desire to keep on living in contentment were at odds in his mind.]
 91:  881| [45] [But Watase eventually made his decision, dashing out of his apartment.]
 92:  950| [45] [It had been 15 years since he'd last visited this place.]
 93:  955| [45] [The place where Wataru had lost her life had apparently been left the way it was for all those years.]
 94:  960| [45] [Probably because it was such a big hospital that demolishing it would cost a sum that no man was willing to pay.]
 95:  965| [45] [There was no sign of anyone in the ruined hospital.]
 96:  973| [47] [Watase]
 97:  976| [45] ["Hey! Is anyone there!?"]
 98:  981| [45] [Watase's shouts simply echoed meaninglessly through the halls.]
 99:  989| [47] [Watase]
100:  992| [45] ["Tch... so it really was a prank."]
101: 1005| [45] [Overcome with both irritation and relief, Watase was about to leave the ruins--]
102: 1010| [45] [--when he spotted something shining on the ground by the entrance.]
103: 1019| [47] [Watase]
104: 1022| [45] ["... The hell's this?"]
105: 1027| [45] [It was a PDA.]
106: 1032| [45] [He took a close look at it to find that the words "Call in progress" were displayed on its screen.]
107: 1037| [47] [Watase]
108: 1038| [45] ["..."]
109: 1049| [45] [Watase picked up the PDA, a sense of unease weighing on his mind.]
110: 1054| [45] [When he did, he heard the voice of the man who'd called him earlier coming from the speakers.]
111: 1062| [47] [???]
112: 1065| [45] ["Hey there. Looks like you really did come."]
113: 1073| [47] [Watase]
114: 1076| [45] ["So it really was you. Rather roundabout way of pranking people, don't you think?"]
115: 1084| [47] [???]
116: 1087| [45] ["Several problems could possibly arise if you were to see my face. Please forgive me for resorting to this method."]
117: 1095| [47] [Watase]
118: 1098| [45] ["And again, I don't get a word you're saying..."]
119: 1106| [47] [Watase]
120: 1109| [45] ["Well, whatever. Anyway, keep your damn promise and tell me that 'truth' you were mentioning, or whatever."]
121: 1114| [45] [The man started talking in a meek voice.]
122: 1171| [47] [???]
123: 1174| [45] ["--As you know, fires broke out simultaneously in 15 different places in this city on September 16th, 2014."]
124: 1182| [47] [???]
125: 1185| [45] ["That's the event we now call the Great Rokumei City Arson... but there are many unsolved mysteries behind that incident, wouldn't you agree?"]
126: 1193| [47] [Watase]
127: 1196| [45] ["Huh? Well, yeah, that's true..."]
128: 1211| [45] [Watase knew about that too.]
129: 1216| [45] [Most of the information concerning the trials related to the incident had not been made public.]
130: 1221| [45] [The country and Rokumei City had been hounded by the media, but they hadn't gotten much information out of them apart from "the incident was caused by an extremist group".]
131: 1229| [47] [???]
132: 1232| [45] ["They claim the incident to be a kind of terrorist attack committed by a group who aimed to reject Communicators."]
133: 1240| [47] [???]
134: 1243| [45] ["They say they kept the details away from the public to prevent copycat criminals and public unrest from rising up."]
135: 1251| [47] [???]
136: 1254| [45] ["Well, it all adds up... It's a rather simple story to swallow."]
137: 1262| [47] [Watase]
138: 1265| [45] ["... What are you implying?"]
139: 1273| [47] [???]
140: 1276| [45] ["The truth is actually the other way around."]
141: 1284| [47] [???]
142: 1287| [45] ["The extremist group that was arrested were nothing more than scapegoats."]
143: 1295| [47] [???]
144: 1298| [45] ["The incident was actually caused by a lone Communicator."]
145: 1303| [45] [Watase doubted what he heard.]
146: 1311| [47] [Watase]
147: 1314| [45] ["A lone Communicator did that!?"]
148: 1322| [47] [Watase]
149: 1325| [45] ["Don't be ridiculous. How the hell could a single Communicator set fire to 15 separate places in the city all at once?"]
150: 1333| [47] [???]
151: 1336| [45] ["It's possible."]
152: 1344| [47] [???]
153: 1347| [45] ["For the cause of it all was a Communicator who possessed an extraordinary power."]
154: 1355| [47] [Watase]
155: 1358| [45] ["What...?"]
156: 1366| [47] [???]
157: 1369| [45] ["She eventually came to be known as 'Communicator A'."]
158: 1374| [45] [The man began explaining the details about this Communicator in a subdued voice.]
159: 1382| [47] [???]
160: 1385| [45] ["A's real name was Alice Enflamme. She moved to Rokumei City from France 15 years ago."]
161: 1393| [47] [???]
162: 1396| [45] ["At the time, the Rokumei City government was inviting Communicators from all over the world to move to the city."]
163: 1404| [47] [???]
164: 1407| [45] ["They needed human resources for various experiments and studies in order to advance their research in the suddenly valuable field of BC."]
165: 1412| [45] [Watase remembered that.]
166: 1417| [45] [Rokumei City had indeed been doing just that all those years ago.]
167: 1425| [47] [???]
168: 1428| [45] ["They called the one who came from France 'A'."]
169: 1436| [47] [???]
170: 1439| [45] ["A was the first Rank S Aptitude Communicator discovered in the world. That's why she caught Rokumei City's eye."]
171: 1447| [47] [???]
172: 1450| [45] ["A was shown in to the PRC and became a test subject for the study and development of BC abilities."]
173: 1458| [47] [???]
174: 1461| [45] ["Back then, all they knew about BC was that it allowed for abilities to send your voice to a faraway person and to read others' minds--"]
175: 1469| [47] [???]
176: 1472| [45] ["But the PRC discovered the underlying mechanisms of telepathy and empathy through their study of A."]
177: 1480| [47] [???]
178: 1483| [45] ["And through all those experiments, A's own BC abilities developed and grew stronger."]
179: 1491| [47] [???]
180: 1494| [45] ["She became able to use telepathy and empathy freely, their effective ranges grew wider, and her power just kept on growing on and on with no end in sight."]
181: 1502| [47] [???]
182: 1505| [45] ["But if that was all there'd been to it, there wouldn't have been any problems."]
183: 1513| [47] [???]
184: 1516| [45] ["The problem was... that A harbored a deep 'malice' in her mind."]
185: 1524| [47] [Watase]
186: 1527| [45] ["Malice...?"]
187: 1535| [47] [???]
188: 1538| [45] ["Yes. All sorts of negative emotions such as resentment, hatred, and rage. They then shifted into malice for others--"]
189: 1546| [47] [???]
190: 1549| [45] ["And A's life was so tragic that it filled her heart."]
191: 1554| [45] [The screen on the PDA then changed when the man said that.]
192: 1632| [45] [It appeared to be a magazine article written in a foreign language.]
193: 1640| [47] [Watase]
194: 1643| [45] ["... What's this?"]
195: 1651| [47] [???]
196: 1654| [45] ["This is a French gossip magazine article about an incident that occurred in A's hometown in February 2014."]
197: 1662| [47] [???]
198: 1665| [45] ["Discrimination against Communicators was fervent at the time in that country, so it appears that A, with her especially tremendous power, was ostracized horribly by the people around her."]
199: 1673| [47] [???]
200: 1676| [45] ["In particular, she was publicly ostracized by a recently established local religious sect--"]
201: 1684| [47] [???]
202: 1687| [45] ["A, with her seemingly incomprehensible abilities, was likely viewed as a servant of the Devil by them."]
203: 1695| [47] [???]
204: 1698| [45] ["Therefore, they caused the incident described in the article before you: they set fire to A's house."]
205: 1707| [47] [Watase]
206: 1710| [45] ["... How inhuman."]
207: 1719| [47] [???]
208: 1722| [45] ["Indeed. But the real inhumanity came after that."]
209: 1730| [47] [???]
210: 1733| [45] ["This is just a guess of mine-- but I'd say that after A became a part of the PRC, it's likely she..."]
211: 1741| [47] [???]
212: 1744| [45] ["Was confined and made into a test subject for human experimentation."]
213: 1752| [47] [Watase]
214: 1755| [45] ["What!?"]
215: 1763| [47] [???]
216: 1766| [45] ["It's very likely when you consider the achievements of the PRC back in those days."]
217: 1774| [47] [???]
218: 1777| [45] ["She fled to Japan to escape persecution only to encounter even more suffering... causing the malice in her heart to amplify further."]
219: 1785| [47] [???]
220: 1788| [45] ["Despite that, the PRC developed her abilities even further... without ever realizing the true danger they possessed."]
221: 1796| [47] [Watase]
222: 1799| [45] ["What was so dangerous about them?"]
223: 1807| [47] [???]
224: 1810| [45] ["You don't know? BC-- telepathy, that is, isn't just the ability to send your voice to a faraway person."]
225: 1818| [47] [???]
226: 1821| [45] ["You can also send your feelings to others with it."]
227: 1829| [47] [???]
228: 1832| [45] ["In other words, powerful BC could very well change other people's thoughts."]
229: 1840| [47] [???]
230: 1843| [45] ["So what do you think would happen if someone who had been turned into malice incarnate like A were to indiscriminately let her thoughts loose on everyone around her?"]
231: 1851| [47] [???]
232: 1854| [45] ["Those thoughts would bring out the 'malice' that lurks in the hearts of every man."]
233: 1862| [47] [???]
234: 1865| [45] ["Her malice would spread to everyone around her like a virulent disease."]
235: 1873| [47] [???]
236: 1876| [45] ["... Now you understand just how dangerous it is, don't you?"]
237: 1899| [47] [Watase]
238: 1902| [45] ["...!"]
239: 1907| [45] [Watase was rendered speechless.]
240: 1912| [45] [He just silently continued to listen to the man.]
241: 1920| [47] [???]
242: 1923| [45] ["... However, A is not at fault. Much of the fault lies in the PRC for exploiting her abilities without even considering the consequences."]
243: 1931| [47] [???]
244: 1934| [45] ["The researchers at the PRC took that poor woman and raised her to become a monster."]
245: 1942| [47] [???]
246: 1945| [45] ["The researchers realized how dangerous A was far too late and set up surveillance to keep her from wandering out into the city--"]
247: 1953| [47] [???]
248: 1956| [45] ["But on September 16th, 2014, A escaped from the facility."]
249: 1964| [47] [Watase]
250: 1967| [45] ["Escaped... then you mean she...!"]
251: 2101| [47] [???]
252: 2104| [45] ["Yes, A spread her malice-laced thoughts all throughout the city that night."]
253: 2112| [47] [???]
254: 2115| [45] ["Those thoughts influenced the minds of the people of Rokumei City in some way."]
255: 2123| [47] [???]
256: 2126| [45] ["This caused the already high levels of malice held by would-be criminals to spike through the roof--"]
257: 2258| [47] [???]
258: 2261| [45] ["And led them to setting the city on fire."]
259: 2269| [47] [???]
260: 2272| [45] ["This is the truth behind the 'Great Rokumei City Arson'."]
261: 2277| [45] [The man declared all of that in a clear voice.]
262: 2351| [47] [Watase]
263: 2352| [45] [(... It can't be...!?)]
264: 2357| [45] [Watase noticed that his hands had started shaking.]
265: 2362| [47] [Watase]
266: 2363| [45] [(Rokumei City and the PRC did all of that...!?)]
267: 2368| [45] [The story was sudden and difficult to believe, but the man spoke in an unwaveringly serious voice, leaving no room for doubt.]
268: 2373| [45] [Watase remained silent as the man continued.]
269: 2381| [47] [???]
270: 2384| [45] ["... This was a scandal for the PRC, and consequently, a scandal for the Rokumei City government, the ones managing the PRC."]
271: 2392| [47] [???]
272: 2395| [45] ["But they won't admit to that."]
273: 2403| [47] [???]
274: 2406| [45] ["Rokumei City hid the truth behind the incident along with the existence of A."]
275: 2414| [47] [???]
276: 2417| [45] ["A was taken back to the PRC in absolute secrecy and confined in a basement of sorts again."]
277: 2474| [47] [???]
278: 2477| [45] ["In the meantime, LABO was constructed on the outskirts of the city. Once it was completed,%NA was transferred from the PRC to LABO."]
279: 2485| [47] [Watase]
280: 2488| [45] ["Wha... why LABO?"]
281: 2496| [47] [Watase]
282: 2499| [45] ["That's a nuclear research facility, isn't it? Why would they send a Communicator there--?"]
283: 2507| [47] [???]
284: 2510| [45] ["No, LABO is no nuclear research facility. It's actually a BC research facility."]
285: 2518| [47] [Watase]
286: 2521| [45] ["Impossible! I never heard anything about that!"]
287: 2539| [47] [???]
288: 2542| [45] ["Of course not. It's this city's biggest secret."]
289: 2550| [47] [???]
290: 2553| [45] ["But don't you think it's strange? There are many hurdles you have to overcome to create a new nuclear reactor."]
291: 2561| [47] [???]
292: 2564| [45] ["You have to clear strict construction standards and legal problems, then make the necessary arrangements with the city council-- yet all of those conditions were cleared quickly and LABO was built."]
293: 2572| [47] [???]
294: 2575| [45] ["Why was LABO able to easily overcome those hurdles and get built in the first place?"]
295: 2583| [47] [???]
296: 2586| [45] ["The answer is simple: it's because LABO doesn't actually have a nuclear reactor. Because it's a BC research facility, not a nuclear research facility."]
297: 2609| [47] [Watase]
298: 2612| [45] ["...!"]
299: 2617| [45] [--The "common sense" Watase had thought to be true up until this point was gradually being rewritten.]
300: 2622| [45] [The man waited a moment for Watase to respond, then continued.]
301: 2630| [47] [???]
302: 2633| [45] ["But the one problem that stood in their way was the sentiments of the townspeople."]
303: 2641| [47] [???]
304: 2644| [45] ["Their antipathy towards nuclear power was overwhelming, as you'd expect."]
305: 2652| [47] [???]
306: 2655| [45] ["But the city explained to the civilians that 'the implementation of truly safe nuclear power is essential to Japan now that our natural resources are drying up'--"]
307: 2663| [47] [???]
308: 2666| [45] ["Which led to the townspeople finally accepting their decision."]
309: 2671| [45] [Watase remembered the turmoil of that time.]
310: 2676| [45] [Watase had been 18 years old at the time, but as he had just enrolled in firefighting school, he hadn't had much of a reaction to all the fuss other than "well, guess the city's gotta do what it's gotta do".]
311: 2684| [47] [???]
312: 2687| [45] ["... But that series of events was all a cover."]
313: 2695| [47] [???]
314: 2698| [45] ["Everyone was opposed to 'nuclear power', but no one suspected that LABO was actually a%N'BC research facility'."]
315: 2706| [47] [???]
316: 2709| [45] ["And they used the dangers and confidentiality of nuclear power research as a pretext to successfully keep the townspeople far away from LABO."]
317: 2717| [47] [Watase]
318: 2720| [45] ["So you mean the guys behind Rokumei City even used the townspeople's feelings of opposition to their advantage...!?"]
319: 2728| [47] [Watase]
320: 2731| [45] ["That's something no person should be allowed to do!"]
321: 2739| [47] [???]
322: 2742| [45] ["That is of trivial importance to the people of LABO. Their only moral code is to take the best possible actions for their research."]
323: 2750| [47] [Watase]
324: 2753| [45] ["No way..."]
325: 2761| [47] [???]
326: 2764| [45] ["At any rate, LABO was then completed."]
327: 2772| [47] [???]
328: 2775| [45] ["And it's no ordinary research facility either. It's also a facility for keeping dangerous Communicators like A locked up."]
329: 2783| [47] [???]
330: 2786| [45] ["There's a residential area of sorts deep beneath LABO. That's where they confined A."]
331: 2794| [47] [Watase]
332: 2797| [45] ["W... wait! Wasn't A put on trial?"]
333: 2805| [47] [Watase]
334: 2808| [45] ["Why would Rokumei City shelter A after all she did!?"]
335: 2816| [47] [???]
336: 2819| [45] ["It's obvious."]
337: 2827| [47] [???]
338: 2830| [45] ["It was so that they could keep on using A as a lab rat after she had caused that huge incident!"]
339: 2838| [47] [Watase]
340: 2841| [45] ["What!?"]
341: 2849| [47] [???]
342: 2852| [45] ["The Rokumei City government and the PRC would be forced to take responsibility were the truth behind the incident to ever come to light."]
343: 2860| [47] [???]
344: 2863| [45] ["So the people behind Rokumei City figured they should cover the whole incident up and continue the research in another location."]
345: 2871| [47] [???]
346: 2874| [45] ["Thus Communicator A came to be known as 'Subject A' from that day onwards and participated in LABO's BC ability research and development."]
347: 2882| [47] [???]
348: 2885| [45] ["Meanwhile, with the PRC having served its purpose, it was turned into a mere dummy facility."]
349: 2893| [47] [???]
350: 2896| [45] ["The results of the BC research secretly conducted at LABO are published through the PRC."]
351: 2904| [47] [???]
352: 2907| [45] ["That way, no one would suspect LABO was a BC research center. And thus, their perfect cover-up system was completed."]
353: 2915| [47] [???]
354: 2918| [45] ["Both LABO and the PRC are government managed facilities. Trace them back to their source and you'll find that they're all closely connected, under the jurisdiction of Rokumei City."]
355: 2923| [47] [Watase]
356: 2924| [45] ["--..."]
357: 2929| [45] [Watase thought things over as calmly as possible, despite the agitation causing his insides to tremble.]
358: 2934| [45] [He wanted to make sure there weren't any inconsistencies in what the man was saying.]
359: 2942| [47] [Watase]
360: 2945| [45] ["... No, hold on..."]
361: 2953| [47] [Watase]
362: 2956| [45] ["Is that really all there is to it? When you think about it normally, wouldn't someone in on the whole thing have tried to stop that whole chain of events?"]
363: 2964| [47] [???]
364: 2967| [45] ["They didn't. You see, back then, Rokumei City was all about focusing their efforts into BC research."]
365: 2975| [47] [???]
366: 2978| [45] ["I think you remember this too, but Japan was showing signs of being in an economic and industrial deadlock back in those days."]
367: 2986| [47] [???]
368: 2989| [45] ["And then new 'technology' known as BC showed up right there and then."]
369: 2997| [47] [???]
370: 3000| [45] ["The guys behind Rokumei City bet on that possibility and pressed forward with their BC technological development, even if it meant pushing every obstacle in their way aside."]
371: 3008| [47] [Watase]
372: 3011| [45] ["What did they have to gain from that...!?"]
373: 3019| [47] [???]
374: 3022| [45] ["All of their advanced technology has the potential to earn them riches beyond your wildest dreams."]
375: 3030| [47] [???]
376: 3033| [45] ["BC is genuinely new technology that no one else in the world has invested in."]
377: 3041| [47] [???]
378: 3044| [45] ["If Japan beat the rest of the world to the punch in its research, that'd put them in the top of that field."]
379: 3052| [47] [???]
380: 3055| [45] ["The fact is that telepathy can be applied to the field of psychiatry..."]
381: 3063| [47] [???]
382: 3066| [45] ["... while empathy has nearly countless potential uses. It could be used for secret intelligence gathering in all sorts of fields, like industry, politics, and the military."]
383: 3074| [47] [???]
384: 3077| [45] ["Thus, those involved built a system based on their new interests and grew obsessed with doing whatever it took to protect those interests, even if it meant covering up anything inconvenient for them."]
385: 3085| [47] [???]
386: 3088| [45] ["And you're yet another victim of those efforts.."]
387: 3096| [47] [Watase]
388: 3099| [45] ["I am!?"]
389: 3107| [47] [???]
390: 3110| [45] ["118 people died in the Great Rokumei City Arson."]
391: 3118| [47] [???]
392: 3121| [45] ["The bereaved families of the victims were given courteous patronage and granted assistance with their lives, moving on to college, and finding jobs."]
393: 3129| [47] [???]
394: 3132| [45] ["There are many others like you who were given homes in public housing and became civil servants."]
395: 3140| [47] [???]
396: 3143| [45] ["But don't you find that strange? Why would a simple local government go so far in taking the bereaved families of the victims into consideration?"]
397: 3151| [47] [???]
398: 3154| [45] ["Their goal was to take the bereaved families under the city's wing and keep a close eye on how they developed from there."]
399: 3162| [47] [Watase]
400: 3165| [45] ["That... that can't be...!"]
401: 3173| [47] [???]
402: 3176| [45] ["Having trouble believing it? Well, I don't blame you. Then I'll send you some documents we've obtained."]
403: 3184| [47] [???]
404: 3187| [45] ["Take a look at them and decide for yourself if what I'm saying is true."]
405: 3192| [45] [An e-mail with an attachment was sent to the PDA right after the man said that.]
406: 3197| [47] [Watase]
407: 3198| [45] [(...?)]
408: 3209| [45] [Watase opened the e-mail and checked the contents of the file.]
409: 3214| [45] [They were various documents that supported the man's claims.]
410: 3257| [45] ["A photo of LABO's interior"--]
411: 3262| [45] [This showed that LABO was no nuclear power research center.]
412: 3267| [45] ["A photo of an e-mail sent from LABO to the PRC"--]
413: 3272| [45] [This e-mail proved that a "BC insulator" that LABO had developed was publicly announced as something from the PRC.]
414: 3277| [45] ["Subject A's Data"--]
415: 3282| [45] [A lot of the data in this one had been deleted, but what remained did confirm that LABO had indeed confined a Communicator called that.]
416: 3287| [45] [All sorts of other documents were there, each one supporting the idea that what the man had said was true.]
417: 3330| [45] [So when he finished reading all of it-- Watase muttered in a stunned voice.]
418: 3338| [47] [Watase]
419: 3341| [45] ["... Is what you're telling me... really true...!?"]
420: 3349| [47] [???]
421: 3352| [45] ["It is. Though it must not be easy to believe, nor is it something you would want to believe."]
422: 3360| [47] [???]
423: 3363| [45] ["But think back on how abnormal this city is. They control information and conduct surveillance on their townspeople without batting an eye, right?"]
424: 3371| [47] [???]
425: 3374| [45] ["Anything's possible in this city, no matter how unbelievable it may sound."]
426: 3379| [45] [Watase was taken aback at those words.]
427: 3384| [45] [The city had grown to do all sorts of things that would normally be considered a violation of human rights on the supposed grounds that Rokumei City was a "government designated top secret city".]
428: 3438| [45] [Such as setting up surveillance cameras all over the city.]
429: 3490| [45] [The city gates that controlled the coming and going of townspeople.]
430: 3495| [45] [The citizen database that only certain people were allowed to access...]
431: 3510| [45] [The townspeople had been opposed to the creation of every single one of them.]
432: 3515| [45] [But their complaints eventually died down, and the security cameras and so on were implemented little by little--]
433: 3520| [45] [And before they knew it, all those things had become like air to the townspeople.]
434: 3525| [45] [No, the townspeople had simply "gotten used" to those abnormalities.]
435: 3545| [47] [Watase]
436: 3546| [45] [(...)]
437: 3551| [45] [Watase felt chills run through him when it hit him just how strange the whole thing was.]
438: 3556| [45] [Since it wasn't directly related to them, no one had thought about it seriously.]
439: 3561| [45] [And thus all sorts of things that couldn't be undone had gone forward without him even noticing it.]
440: 3569| [47] [Watase]
441: 3572| [45] ["... So what are you saying...!?"]
442: 3580| [47] [Watase]
443: 3583| [45] ["My family... died because of that monster built up by the Rokumei City government and the PRC..."]
444: 3591| [47] [Watase]
445: 3594| [45] ["Yet at the time, the Rokumei City government hid their crimes and never took responsibility..."]
446: 3603| [47] [Watase]
447: 3606| [45] ["And... I received money from that very same government and lived a comfortable life up until today without knowing a damn thing...!?"]
448: 3614| [47] [???]
449: 3617| [45] ["Unfortunately, that's exactly it."]
450: 3625| [47] [???]
451: 3628| [45] ["You were raised by the government responsible for your family's deaths and have been working for them as a civil servant."]
452: 3708| [47] [Watase]
453: 3711| [45] ["--!!"]
454: 3716| [45] [Watase let out a wordless scream.]
455: 3721| [45] [His blood boiled and a deep red filled his vision.]
456: 3729| [47] [Watase]
457: 3732| [45] ["F-f... fuck that!!"]
458: 3740| [47] [Watase]
459: 3743| [45] ["What happened to Subject A!? Is she still living in LABO!?"]
460: 3751| [47] [???]
461: 3754| [45] ["No, she died."]
462: 3762| [47] [Watase]
463: 3765| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
464: 3773| [47] [???]
465: 3776| [45] ["After causing that incident, A was used by LABO as a human test subject-- and then died there just a year after she'd been confined."]
466: 3784| [47] [???]
467: 3787| [45] ["She probably died a cruel death. In the end, A too was nothing more than a victim of Rokumei City's wrongdoings."]
468: 3795| [47] [Watase]
469: 3798| [45] ["..."]
470: 3803| [45] [A sense of emptiness filled Watase's body.]
471: 3808| [45] [Having immediately lost the target of his hatred-- he switched it over to a new one.]
472: 3816| [47] [Watase]
473: 3819| [45] ["What happened with the Rokumei City government... after that?"]
474: 3827| [47] [Watase]
475: 3830| [45] ["What happened with LABO after they lost their valuable test subject due to A's death?"]
476: 3838| [47] [???]
477: 3841| [45] ["They abducted new test subjects and used them to continue their BC research."]
478: 3849| [47] [???]
479: 3852| [45] ["Out of all the Communicators who live in Rokumei City-- those who possess particularly superb abilities are confined in LABO and made into test subjects."]
480: 3860| [47] [???]
481: 3863| [45] ["However, to continue their research... they are victimizing children."]
482: 3868| [45] [Watase felt sympathy well up in his heart when he heard that.]
483: 3873| [47] [Watase]
484: 3874| [45] [(Even if they're Communicators, victimizing kids is just...!)]
485: 3879| [45] [It was absolutely unforgivable.]
486: 3887| [47] [???]
487: 3890| [45] ["But no one's realized this. So there's no one who can talk about or leak this."]
488: 3898| [47] [???]
489: 3901| [45] ["The truth will forever continue to be covered-up and vanish into the deepest darkness."]
490: 3909| [47] [Watase]
491: 3912| [45] ["... I see..."]
492: 3920| [47] [Watase]
493: 3923| [45] ["So the Rokumei City government... Wataru's killers..."]
494: 3931| [47] [Watase]
495: 3934| [45] ["... are doing the same thing they did 15 years ago all over again...!"]
496: 3939| [45] [Flames of rage burned up within Watase.]
497: 3944| [45] [He sealed those pitch black flames deep within his chest and continued.]
498: 3952| [47] [Watase]
499: 3955| [45] ["Hey, lemme ask you something... What do you gain from telling me all this?"]
500: 3963| [47] [Watase]
501: 3966| [45] ["What do you want me to do...?"]
502: 3974| [47] [???]
503: 3977| [45] ["Let me reverse the question. What do -you- want to do?"]
504: 4000| [47] [Watase]
505: 4003| [45] ["..."]
506: 4011| [47] [???]
507: 4014| [45] ["Watase Kasasagi, I ask this straight to your heart. Now that you know the truth, can you return to that false peace?"]
508: 4022| [47] [???]
509: 4025| [45] ["Tell me your true feelings."]
510: 4093| [45] [Watase's heart pounded loudly at that request.]
511: 4098| [47] [Watase]
512: 4099| [45] [(Can I keep on living the same carefree life now that I know the truth...!?)]
513: 4157| [45] [The Rokumei City government had killed his sister and parents, twisted his life--]
514: 4162| [45] [And on top of all that, they'd hidden the truth and forced him to live an unknowing lie for 15 years.]
515: 4214| [45] [Watase had pushed his hatred of the culprit of the incident into the deepest corners of his heart by following his sister's dream.]
516: 4219| [45] [But the truth was, there was a certain desire he'd secretly held all these years.]
517: 4237| [47] [Watase]
518: 4240| [45] ["... I..."]
519: 4248| [47] [Watase]
520: 4251| [45] ["... I wanted to make the culprit go through the same pain Wataru did."]
521: 4259| [47] [???]
522: 4262| [45] ["Ah yes, Wataru was your sister, correct?"]
523: 4270| [47] [Watase]
524: 4273| [45] ["... Yeah."]
525: 4356| [47] [Watase]
526: 4359| [45] ["She... she was such a good person..."]
527: 4367| [47] [Watase]
528: 4370| [45] ["She was weak, but motivated... Stupid, but gentle...!"]
529: 4386| [45] [Tears poured out of Watase's eyes when he said that.]
530: 4391| [45] [--Watase loved Wataru.]
531: 4396| [45] [He hated the one who had taken her away from him forever from the bottom of his heart.]
532: 4401| [45] [But everything about the culprit, including her very existence, had been concealed by the Rokumei City government.]
533: 4406| [45] [If possible, he would've very much liked to tear A limb from limb, but that was no longer an option.]
534: 4411| [45] [Then that left the Rokumei City government as the only target for Watase's hatred and anger.]
535: 4419| [47] [Watase]
536: 4422| [45] ["... Hey..."]
537: 4430| [47] [Watase]
538: 4433| [45] ["Should I feel ashamed... about wanting revenge...?"]
539: 4438| [47] [???]
540: 4439| [45] ["..."]
541: 4447| [47] [Watase]
542: 4450| [45] ["... Is it okay for me to want revenge... when it's my job to save lives?"]
543: 4458| [47] [Watase]
544: 4461| [45] ["Is it okay for me to hate the bastards running Rokumei City?"]
545: 4469| [47] [???]
546: 4472| [45] ["Of course."]
547: 4477| [45] [The man's answer was clear and blunt.]
548: 4485| [47] [???]
549: 4488| [45] ["It's only human... for you to hate your family's killer."]
550: 4496| [47] [???]
551: 4499| [45] ["And if you truly feel that way--"]
552: 4507| [47] [???]
553: 4510| [45] ["Then you can become one of us. Our comrade."]
554: 4521| [45] [Watase heard footsteps coming from behind at that moment.]
555: 4544| [47] [Watase]
556: 4547| [45] ["!!"]
557: 4552| [45] [Watase turned around in surprise--]
558: 4576| [45] [--only to see a man standing there.]
559: 4581| [45] [Judging from the fact that he was holding a PDA, he had likely been the one talking to Watase just now.]
560: 4589| [47] [Watase]
561: 4592| [45] ["Wh-who are you...!?"]
562: 4600| [47] [Ukita]
563: 4603| [45] ["Me? I'm a researcher at LABO."]
564: 4608| [45] [The man put his PDA away and answered.]
565: 4646| [47] [Ukita]
566: 4649| [45] ["But I too hate LABO and Rokumei City, much like you."]
567: 4657| [47] [Watase]
568: 4660| [45] ["What...!?"]
569: 4665| [45] [A whistleblower-- that term passed through Watase's head.]
570: 4670| [45] [He'd sent him pictures of LABO and data about the test subject just minutes ago.]
571: 4675| [45] [Only someone on the inside could have obtained those things.]
572: 4683| [47] [Watase]
573: 4686| [45] ["But what did you mean by 'become one of us'... No, wait, what do you mean by 'us'?"]
574: 4712| [47] [Ukita]
575: 4715| [45] ["You see, while I work as a researcher for LABO, I am also a member of a certain organization."]
576: 4723| [47] [Watase]
577: 4726| [45] ["What organization?"]
578: 4734| [47] [Ukita]
579: 4737| [45] ["The extremist organization who was arrested for the Great Arson 15 years ago."]
580: 4745| [47] [Ukita]
581: 4748| [45] ["The ones who were branded as criminals instead of Communicator A."]
582: 4771| [47] [Watase]
583: 4774| [45] ["--!"]
584: 4779| [45] [Watase was astonished.]
585: 4787| [47] [Watase]
586: 4790| [45] ["Wait, do you mean... you guys are terrorists!?"]
587: 4816| [47] [Ukita]
588: 4819| [45] ["Terrorists, huh? It's true that those who stand up against authority have been frequently called by that term."]
589: 4827| [47] [Watase]
590: 4830| [45] ["Quit mincing words! What you guys do is commit acts of destruction, plain and simple!"]
591: 4838| [47] [Watase]
592: 4841| [45] ["You're the ones who set up bombs at the PRC before, weren't you!? All you've done is give us that much more work to do--"]
593: 4867| [47] [Ukita]
594: 4870| [45] ["Hold on! It's not like I'm a member of this extremist organization because I want to be!"]
595: 4878| [47] [Ukita]
596: 4881| [45] ["There's just no other organization out there who I can count on to oppose Rokumei City.%NThat's all there is to it."]
597: 4889| [47] [Watase]
598: 4892| [45] ["What...? But can't you just tell the police to..."]
599: 4918| [47] [Ukita]
600: 4921| [45] ["Won't work. Considering the fact that they've been able to keep such a large-scale cover-up running for so long, it's best to assume Rokumei City has the police in their pocket."]
601: 4947| [47] [Ukita]
602: 4950| [45] ["And when you look at how much information control is going on, that leaves the media out of the picture too."]
603: 4976| [47] [Ukita]
604: 4979| [45] ["And before you suggest standing up to them by myself, that's out of the question too. Someone tried that once, and they got murdered in a way that looked like an accident."]
605: 4987| [47] [Ukita]
606: 4990| [45] ["But despite all that, I want to reveal the truth...!"]
607: 4998| [47] [Ukita]
608: 5001| [45] ["I want to bring LABO's wrongdoings to light, even if it means making an enemy of the entire city!"]
609: 5009| [47] [Watase]
610: 5012| [45] ["Wh... why are you going so far!?"]
611: 5038| [47] [Ukita]
612: 5041| [45] ["Much like you, I also have a reason to fight."]
613: 5049| [47] [Ukita]
614: 5052| [45] ["You should understand by now why I told you all this."]
615: 5060| [47] [Ukita]
616: 5063| [45] ["My comrades and I are currently formulating a plan to deal a crippling blow to Rokumei City and LABO."]
617: 5071| [47] [Ukita]
618: 5074| [45] ["And we need your help to carry out this plan."]
619: 5082| [47] [Watase]
620: 5085| [45] ["You need... me?"]
621: 5111| [47] [Ukita]
622: 5114| [45] ["You're free to refuse, of course."]
623: 5140| [47] [Ukita]
624: 5143| [45] ["If you then proceed to go to the police and tell them everything you've just heard, I will most likely be arrested as a terrorist."]
625: 5169| [47] [Ukita]
626: 5172| [45] ["Though perhaps LABO will get to me before the police can, and kill me."]
627: 5180| [47] [Watase]
628: 5183| [45] ["..."]
629: 5209| [47] [Ukita]
630: 5212| [45] ["I'm taking a huge risk by showing you my face and telling you all about my background."]
631: 5220| [47] [Ukita]
632: 5223| [45] ["But I'd like to believe that you'll become one of our comrades..."]
633: 5231| [47] [Ukita]
634: 5234| [45] ["I want to believe that all the things you said about your deceased sister just minutes ago were true."]
635: 5258| [45] [The man then looked Watase dead in the eye.]
636: 5284| [47] [Ukita]
637: 5287| [45] ["You can still turn back now. You can forget everything and return to your normal life."]
638: 5295| [47] [Ukita]
639: 5298| [45] ["But if you want to fight Rokumei City alongside us--"]
640: 5324| [47] [Ukita]
641: 5327| [45] ["Then become one of us."]
642: 5332| [45] [Watase looked the man back in the eye.]
643: 5337| [45] [After a long silence, he finally answered.]
644: 5345| [47] [Watase]
645: 5348| [45] ["... What's the name of your organization?"]
646: 5374| [47] [Ukita]
647: 5377| [45] ["--Q."]
648: 5385| [47] [Ukita]
649: 5388| [45] ["We are the ones who pose the unrelenting questions to this insidious world."]
