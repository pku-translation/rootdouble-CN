  1:    9| [45] [Just then, Ena, who'd kept quiet the whole time, cut into the conversation.]
  2:   89| [47] [Ena]
  3:   92| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, why aren't you saying anything?"]
  4:  100| [47] [Ena]
  5:  103| [45] ["Are you just going to let what they said pass as fact?"]
  6:  111| [47] [Watase]
  7:  114| [45] ["Teach... you don't trust me either?"]
  8:  119| [45] [Then that meant that Watase had lost the trust of the whole team.]
  9:  145| [47] [Ena]
 10:  148| [45] ["That's..."]
 11:  174| [47] [Ena]
 12:  177| [45] ["... But if things keep going this way, I can't trust you."]
 13:  185| [47] [Ena]
 14:  188| [45] ["You'll need to show some proof if you want to be trusted."]
 15:  196| [47] [Ena]
 16:  199| [45] ["You need to tell everyone what you were doing in that 'six minute blank'."]
 17:  204| [45] [The six minute blank--]
 18:  209| [45] [That was indeed the main reason why no one trusted him right now.]
 19:  217| [47] [Watase]
 20:  220| [45] ["B-but..."]
 21:  225| [45] [He couldn't recall the events of those six minutes no matter how hard he tried.]
 22:  230| [45] [Ena then spoke to Watase in a compelling voice.]
 23:  256| [47] [Ena]
 24:  259| [45] ["Please, Captain Kasasagi... I want to trust you. But I can't do that now."]
 25:  267| [47] [Ena]
 26:  270| [45] ["I need a reason to help you out."]
 27:  278| [47] [Watase]
 28:  281| [45] ["T-Teach..."]
 29:  286| [47] [Watase]
 30:  287| [45] [(Could she be giving me a chance?)]
 31:  292| [45] [Watase desperately tried to think of something that would support Ena's argument.]
 32:  297| [45] [--But he had nothing.]
 33:  302| [45] [He couldn't find anything that would satisfy his comrades' doubts.]
 34:  369| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  372| [45] ["I think we've waited long enough, Ms. Tsubakiyama."]
 36:  380| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  383| [45] ["We've already offered enough evidence to cast suspicion on Captain Kasasagi.%NAny more discussion would be fruitless."]
 38:  425| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  428| [45] ["Right? Don't you agree, Ms. Moribe?"]
 40:  454| [47] [Jun]
 41:  457| [45] ["Yeah... I can't trust the Captain anymore either..."]
 42:  483| [47] [Ena]
 43:  486| [45] ["Hold on, guys! Let's hear him out for a little while--"]
 44:  512| [47] [Ukita]
 45:  515| [45] ["No, he's had enough time to make his excuses."]
 46:  541| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  544| [45] ["Or do you have some concrete reason to want to cover for him?"]
 48:  570| [47] [Ena]
 49:  573| [45] ["W-well..."]
 50:  599| [47] [Jun]
 51:  602| [45] ["You don't, right? Then just shut up already."]
 52:  610| [47] [Jun]
 53:  613| [45] ["If you don't-- then things could get ugly again, like when we found that gun you were hiding."]
 54:  639| [47] [Ena]
 55:  642| [45] ["..."]
 56:  647| [45] [Jun and Ukita's harsh glares shut Ena right up.]
 57:  652| [45] [Ukita then turned his gaze to Watase and spoke.]
 58:  722| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  725| [45] ["Now then... what to do with you?"]
 60:  733| [47] [Jun]
 61:  736| [45] ["Why don't we tie him up and lock him away somewhere?"]
 62:  744| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  747| [45] ["Sounds good. Now that that's decided, let's find something to bind him--"]
 64:  755| [47] [Jun]
 65:  758| [45] ["Oh, how about this cable? Will it work?"]
 66:  766| [47] [Ukita]
 67:  769| [45] ["Yes. I'm sure pulling out one mere cable won't do any harm to the system."]
 68:  774| [45] [The two of them smirked at each other maliciously as they pulled a cable out from under the control panel.]
 69:  779| [45] [It was then that Watase finally realized it:]
 70:  863| [45] [Their eyes were full of madness.]
 71:  927| [47] [Watase]
 72:  928| [45] [(Th-this is bad... these guys aren't in their right minds...!)]
 73:  933| [45] [Watase glanced briefly at the door as he shuddered in fear.]
 74:  938| [45] [--Just then.]
 75:  994| [47] [Jun]
 76:  997| [45] ["Ah! Trying to run!?"]
 77: 1005| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1008| [45] ["Not good! Hold him down!"]
 79: 1113| [45] [The two of them suddenly sprung at Watase.]
 80: 1123| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1126| [45] ["--!"]
 82: 1142| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1145| [45] ["L-let me go!"]
 84: 1152| [45] [Watase succumbed to panic and shook them off of him.]
 85: 1157| [45] [It was right then that his elbow smashed into Jun's face.]
 86: 1233| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1236| [45] ["Ahh!"]
 88: 1241| [45] [Jun screamed, and then--]
 89: 1292| [45] [Watase heard a very thick sound behind him.]
 90: 1347| [45] [He turned around to see Jun's head crashing into the edge of a piece of machinery.]
 91: 1355| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1358| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 93: 1363| [45] [Jun moaned in agony-- then suddenly stopped moving right then and there, her eyes still agape.]
 94: 1428| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1431| [45] ["M-Moribe!?"]
 96: 1436| [45] [Kazami spoke in what almost sounded like a scream and held Jun's body in her arms.]
 97: 1444| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1447| [45] ["Moribe! Hang in there! Moribe!"]
 99: 1452| [45] [But Jun didn't answer.]
100: 1478| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1481| [45] ["I-it can't be..."]
102: 1486| [45] [Kazami lost her composure and checked Jun's Vital Checker.]
103: 1583| [45] [--All red. Vital signs flat.]
104: 1588| [45] [Watase saw that with his own eyes.]
105: 1612| [47] [Watase]
106: 1615| [45] ["A-are you kidding me...?"]
107: 1620| [45] [Humans shouldn't be able to die so easily.]
108: 1625| [45] [That thought flickered through Watase's head.]
109: 1630| [45] [But the fact remained that Jun was neither moving nor breathing.]
110: 1660| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1663| [45] ["Aaah, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
112: 1671| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1674| [45] ["Jun! Please answer me! Jun! Jun!"]
114: 1700| [47] [Kazami]
115: 1703| [45] ["Why... why did this...!?"]
116: 1747| [45] [Kazami's shouts of grief echoed through the room.]
117: 1809| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1812| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... you've really done it this time...!"]
119: 1817| [45] [A dark flame smoldered in Ukita's eyes.]
120: 1825| [47] [Watase]
121: 1828| [45] ["N-no... no, I didn't...!"]
122: 1887| [45] [Watase panicked. Before he knew it, he was bolting for the door.]
123: 1917| [45] [Ena stood in his way.]
124: 1922| [45] [Watase immediately shouted at her.]
125: 1930| [47] [Watase]
126: 1933| [45] ["Teach! Please get out of my way!"]
127: 1941| [47] [Ena]
128: 1944| [45] ["No... I can't do that..."]
129: 1970| [47] [Ena]
130: 1973| [45] ["I hate to say it... but you have committed a grave sin..."]
131: 1981| [47] [Ena]
132: 1984| [45] ["Now you must live up to it as an adult. As a man."]
133: 2010| [47] [Ena]
134: 2013| [45] ["So please-- don't run away from the reality behind you! I'm begging you!"]
135: 2018| [45] [Ena looked Watase straight in the eye, compelling him to listen to her.]
136: 2023| [45] [There were no signs of madness in her eyes.]
137: 2031| [47] [Watase]
138: 2034| [45] ["Teach..."]
139: 2039| [45] [Watase had indeed committed a sin.]
140: 2044| [45] [Accident or not, he had still taken the life of one of his comrades with his very hands.]
141: 2049| [45] [That was something completely unforgivable.]
142: 2054| [47] [Watase]
143: 2055| [45] [(I... dammit...)]
144: 2060| [45] [Watase stopped trying to run away, his strength slowly leaving him.]
145: 2065| [45] [He then looked at Ena and spoke.]
146: 2073| [47] [Watase]
147: 2076| [45] ["I'm sorry... I'll do as you say."]
148: 2081| [45] [Watase feebly gave that answer-- but then...]
149: 2110| [47] [Watase]
150: 2113| [45] ["!!"]
151: 2118| [45] [Someone suddenly rammed right into his back with all their might.]
152: 2123| [45] [Watase was sent flying to the ground--]
153: 2164| [47] [Ena]
154: 2167| [45] ["Ahh!"]
155: 2172| [45] [--and knocked into Ena, who fell with him.]
156: 2226| [45] [When he came to his senses, someone was bending over his back.]
157: 2231| [47] [Watase]
158: 2232| [45] [(--Who is it!?)]
159: 2237| [45] [Was it Ukita? Or Kazami?]
160: 2242| [45] [But as Watase tried to turn around--]
161: 2250| [47] [Watase]
162: 2253| [45] ["--!?"]
163: 2258| [45] [His whole body went numb with a shock.]
164: 2263| [45] [Something had been slid between his ribs through his back.]
165: 2268| [45] [--Something cold?]
166: 2273| [45] [That thought crossed Watase's mind for a minute,]
167: 2278| [47] [Watase]
168: 2279| [45] [(It burns!)]
169: 2284| [45] [but he was mistaken. His brain had merely perceived it incorrectly.]
170: 2289| [45] [A second later, he realized what had happened.]
171: 2294| [47] [Watase]
172: 2295| [45] [(I've-- been stabbed!?)]
173: 2300| [45] [By who? With what? Why?]
174: 2305| [45] [Those questions flashed through his head all at once.]
175: 2375| [47] [???]
176: 2378| [45] ["Haah... haah... haah..."]
177: 2383| [45] [He heard someone panting heavily.]
178: 2391| [47] [Ena]
179: 2394| [45] ["Wha... why would you--!?"]
180: 2399| [47] [Watase]
181: 2400| [45] [(--Who is it!?)]
182: 2405| [47] [Watase]
183: 2406| [45] [(Who stabbed me!?)]
184: 2411| [45] [But before he could figure it out--]
185: 2543| [47] [Watase]
186: 2546| [45] ["Gagh-- gaaaaagh!"]
187: 2551| [45] [Watase threw blood up on Ena's chest.]
188: 2556| [45] [And it didn't stop there--]
189: 2564| [47] [Watase]
190: 2567| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
191: 2572| [45] [A great rush of blood came flooding out of his mouth with each violent coughing fit.]
192: 2577| [45] [His lungs were already full of blood.]
193: 2582| [45] [He couldn't breathe.]
194: 2587| [45] [It hurt. So much so that he couldn't take it.]
195: 2595| [47] [Watase]
196: 2598| [45] ["*cough* *cough*! *cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*!"]
197: 2603| [45] [His vision was dyed dark red with blood.]
198: 2608| [45] [And then--]
199: 2656| [45] [Light suddenly dissipated from his field of vision.]
200: 2661| [45] [Sound also faded away from his world.]
201: 2666| [45] [Despite that, his suffering did not end.]
202: 2671| [45] [He was drowning in the blood filling his lungs.]
203: 2676| [45] [It hurts.]
204: 2681| [45] [It hurts.]
205: 2686| [45] [It hurts.]
206: 2691| [45] [He screamed.]
207: 2699| [47] [Watase]
208: 2702| [45] [" "]
209: 2707| [45] [My voice isn't coming out!]
210: 2712| [45] [It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.]
211: 2717| [47] [Watase]
212: 2718| [45] [(Is this my punishment for taking Jun's life!?)]
213: 2723| [47] [Watase]
214: 2724| [45] [(Then please-- let it end quickly!)]
215: 2729| [45] [Watase's consciousness was then devoured wholly by his agony.]
216: 2817| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%Nã€€%N]
217: 2820| [45] [âˆšA Bad Ending #10 [The Murderer]]
218: 2823| [85] [ã€€]
219: 2826| [45] [The result of Ena not having enough trust in Watase and not sticking up for him.]
220: 2829| [85] [ã€€]
221: 2832| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by either raising favor towards Ena leading up to this point]
222: 2835| [45] [or by setting Kazami and Jun's Senses higher than Watase's at the SSS input just before this ending.]
