  1:   63| [45] [Once Watase left, the shelter went quiet.]
  2:   82| [45] [After a few silent moments, Natsuhiko spoke to Ukita.]
  3:  108| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  111| [45] ["... Um, Mr. Ukita, I'm sorry."]
  5:  137| [47] [Ukita]
  6:  140| [45] ["Hmm? For what?"]
  7:  148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  151| [45] ["I read your memory without permission."]
  9:  159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  162| [45] ["That's like a major invasion of privacy, so... I'm really sorry."]
 11:  188| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  191| [45] ["Oh, has that been bothering you?"]
 13:  199| [47] [Ukita]
 14:  202| [45] ["I don't particularly mind. It was a necessary step to cancel out Subject N's malice, wasn't it?"]
 15:  210| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  213| [45] ["Yeah, but... I saw basically all of your memory pertaining to your motive behind carrying out this terrorist attack."]
 17:  221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  224| [45] ["Did you have a flashback of your past memories back there? Those are the memories I saw."]
 19:  250| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  253| [45] ["I see... But I'm sure there weren't any memories in there that would've been problematic for you to have seen."]
 21:  279| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  282| [45] ["So honestly, it's nothing to concern yourself about. Rather, I feel you helped me reaffirm my convictions."]
 23:  308| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  311| [45] ["I had the opportunity to recall in such vivid detail the day I swore to fight against LABO, after all."]
 25:  319| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  322| [45] ["In the process of following your memories, I experienced that day vicariously too... I think you're a brave man, Mr. Ukita."]
 27:  327| [45] [A look of regret suddenly spread across Ukita's face when Natsuhiko said that.]
 28:  353| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  356| [45] ["I appreciate the sentiment. But the compliment itself isn't very uplifting when the result of my bravery turned out like this."]
 30:  364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  367| [45] ["Huh?"]
 32:  375| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  378| [45] ["Naturally, I remember all of the actions I took when I was infected with malice. In hindsight, they were all illogical actions, but still..."]
 34:  386| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  389| [45] ["The 'me' during the time my malice was amplified still certainly felt like 'me'."]
 36:  394| [45] [As Ukita muttered that, he looked at the gun in his hands.]
 37:  420| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  423| [45] ["... I shot at Captain Kasasagi with this gun. As if to push all the blame of the plan's failure onto him."]
 39:  429| [45] [After a short moment of silence, Yuuri murmured.]
 40:  455| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  458| [45] ["... Captain Kasasagi... looks like he's really pushing himself hard..."]
 42:  478| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  479| [45] [(...!)]
 44:  512| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart twinged slightly in pain at those words.]
 45:  600| [45] [Ever since he had returned Watase's memories, they began cooperating only because they happened to share a common interest.]
 46:  605| [45] [But their relationship before that seemed to be far better in Natsuhiko's eyes.]
 47:  610| [45] [It was far better back when their minds were connected and they sought a way to survive together--]
 48:  644| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  647| [45] ["... But it's not like I'm opposing him because I want to or anything."]
 50:  655| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  658| [45] ["If I don't speak out against him like that, I'm sure he'll never change his line of thought."]
 52:  684| [47] [Yuuri]
 53:  687| [45] ["Huh... Don't tell me you did that... for me...?"]
 54:  695| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  698| [45] ["Yeah. I want him to reconsider his plan to take you away... that's all."]
 56:  725| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  728| [45] ["His plan to what!? Captain Kasasagi still hasn't given up on fulfilling his mission as a member of Q?"]
 58:  736| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  739| [45] ["No, he hasn't. I want to put a stop to him. I can't let him take Yuuri away."]
 60:  771| [47] [Ukita]
 61:  774| [45] ["I see... That really does sound like something he'd do, though..."]
 62:  800| [47] [Yuuri]
 63:  803| [45] ["But still... I don't like it... when you and Captain Kasasagi fight, Hikorin..."]
 64:  811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  814| [45] ["..."]
 66:  819| [45] [Despite Yuuri's complaints, Natsuhiko still couldn't help it.]
 67:  932| [45] [Watase had his sights firmly set on fulfilling his mission with Q.]
 68:  937| [45] [Natsuhiko had his sights firmly set on protecting Yuuri and everyone else.]
 69:  942| [45] [As long as those firm beliefs remained incompatible, a compromise between Natsuhiko and Watase was impossible.]
 70:  950| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  953| [45] ["Dammit... I went through the trouble of erasing his malice. So why can't we come to a complete understanding...!?"]
 72:  971| [45] [As Natsuhiko muttered to himself, Ukita asked him a question.]
 73: 1003| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1006| [45] ["... By the way, Natsuhiko. About that malice..."]
 75: 1014| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1017| [45] ["Huh?"]
 77: 1025| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1028| [45] ["You said that Subject N amplifies the malice of others by manipulating their memories and propagating her will..."]
 79: 1036| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1039| [45] ["Is that correct?"]
 81: 1047| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1050| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
 83: 1077| [47] [Yuuri]
 84: 1080| [45] ["Were you not aware that she had done so either, Mr. Ukita?"]
 85: 1112| [47] [Ukita]
 86: 1115| [45] ["... Not at all. Not until just now, that is."]
 87: 1120| [45] [Ukita sighed.]
 88: 1177| [47] [Ukita]
 89: 1180| [45] ["Naturally, I remember all of the actions I took when I was infected with malice."]
 90: 1188| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1191| [45] ["But when I think about it now, it all feels like it happened in a dream."]
 92: 1199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1202| [45] ["I guess that's the truly terrifying part about Subject N..."]
 94: 1236| [47] [Ukita]
 95: 1239| [45] ["Indeed. But what's more terrifying--"]
 96: 1247| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1250| [45] ["--is that the 'me' during the time my malice was amplified still certainly felt like 'me'."]
 98: 1258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1261| [45] ["Huh?"]
100: 1287| [47] [Ukita]
101: 1290| [45] ["'It's not my fault victims turned up. It's all Captain Kasasagi's fault.'"]
102: 1298| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1301| [45] ["It wasn't Subject N who had that thought, but 'my' consciousness."]
104: 1327| [47] [Ukita]
105: 1330| [45] ["The realization of just how small and cowardly I am... was truly frightening."]
106: 1335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1336| [45] ["..."]
108: 1341| [45] [Natsuhiko understood the meaning behind Ukita's words.]
109: 1396| [45] [No matter how good a person may be, perhaps not a single one is completely free from malice.]
110: 1401| [45] [And those who came into contact with Subject N came to know their true selves, whether they wanted to or not.]
111: 1406| [45] [They all came to realize the monster they harbored in the depths of their minds.]
112: 1439| [47] [Ukita]
113: 1442| [45] ["... I never wanted to admit that part of me existed, you see..."]
114: 1450| [47] [Ukita]
115: 1453| [45] ["I intended to muster up all my courage and good will, but not only did I fail to accomplish my goals, I also ended up producing the worst possible results."]
116: 1461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1464| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, that's just--..."]
118: 1469| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to say something, but he couldn't find the words.]
119: 1474| [45] [Ukita shook his head as if to say "it's fine", and continued.]
120: 1514| [47] [Ukita]
121: 1517| [45] ["... I should apologize to you kids too."]
122: 1525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1528| [45] ["Huh?"]
124: 1536| [47] [Ukita]
125: 1539| [45] ["The truth is that my actions triggered this incident in the first place."]
126: 1544| [45] [Naturally, Natsuhiko knew that.]
127: 1549| [45] [He learned the whole details of what led up to the incident from Ukita's memories.]
128: 1554| [45] [He knew all the hardships Ukita faced as he came to cause this incident, and how he felt throughout it all.]
129: 1580| [47] [Ukita]
130: 1583| [45] ["That's how I've always been. No matter how much I act in accordance with my beliefs, it always turns out for the worse."]
131: 1591| [47] [Ukita]
132: 1594| [45] ["I drag so many people into my mess and in the end, I can never save anyone. And look at what I've gotten everyone into now..."]
133: 1620| [47] [Ukita]
134: 1623| [45] ["... I guess with justice as fragile as mine, I should never have acted on it, should I?"]
135: 1628| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered those words.]
136: 1633| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1634| [45] [(Mr. Ukita's methods were... indeed flawed in some places.)]
138: 1639| [45] [It wasn't as if Ukita had acted in accordance with a perfect sense of justice.]
139: 1644| [45] [There should've been another way.]
140: 1649| [45] [But-- Yuuri did not judge him.]
141: 1676| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 1679| [45] ["But Mr. Ukita... It's because of your desire to save us that Hikorin and I were finally able to see each other."]
143: 1706| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1709| [45] ["Even if you were mistaken, it's all because you persisted in acting in accordance with your beliefs..."]
145: 1739| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 1742| [45] ["So, well, I'm not sure if it will be any consolation to you for me to say this, but..."]
147: 1768| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 1771| [45] ["... Thank you."]
149: 1776| [45] [Once Ukita heard her words of gratitude, he smiled faintly.]
150: 1802| [47] [Ukita]
151: 1805| [45] ["No... that's a real lifesaver."]
152: 1831| [47] [Ukita]
153: 1834| [45] ["I tried to save you, but you saved me from myself. This situation's all sorts of backwards."]
154: 1860| [47] [Yuuri]
155: 1863| [45] ["Aha, I guess you're right."]
156: 1868| [45] [Yuuri smiled at those words.]
157: 1873| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled as well, and then turned to his thoughts.]
158: 1878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 1879| [45] [(Mr. Ukita's probably okay now... He had a strong sense of justice to begin with, after all.)]
160: 1937| [45] [Now that Ukita was free from malice and regretted his actions, he would probably be a reassuring ally to them now.]
161: 1977| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1980| [45] ["... But still, I feel like the more I know about LABO... the more I understand your feelings, Mr. Ukita."]
163: 1988| [47] [Ukita]
164: 1991| [45] ["Is that so?"]
165: 1999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2002| [45] ["Yes. The more you learn about the inner mechanisms of LABO, the more wicked it seems, doesn't it?"]
167: 2010| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2013| [45] ["I understand why you'd want to expose it, Mr. Ukita. And why you'd want to punish the upper ranks, too."]
169: 2039| [47] [Ukita]
170: 2042| [45] ["Indeed. LABO holds too many secrets. It's only natural since they conduct such shady business, but... that's not the end of their problems."]
171: 2050| [47] [Ukita]
172: 2053| [45] ["I've come to believe that it's for that reason that the antagonism between Communicators and ordinary people persists in this world."]
173: 2061| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2064| [45] ["The antagonism... huh."]
175: 2090| [47] [Ukita]
176: 2093| [45] ["BC research is indeed necessary, and there are certain truths that should remain hidden. But hide too many secrets, and I doubt you'll be able to earn the understanding of those around you."]
177: 2101| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2104| [45] ["To the insufficiently informed masses of ordinary people, BC and Communicators are nothing more than unintelligible concepts."]
179: 2112| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 2115| [45] ["Yeah, that's true..."]
181: 2120| [45] [Those words reminded Natsuhiko of what he had once heard from Ena.]
182: 2125| [45] [That outside of Rokumei City, disputes between Communicators and ordinary people had yet to die down.]
183: 2130| [45] [The thought made Natsuhiko depressed.]
184: 2136| [45] [Ukita himself spoke while gazing at the door Watase had left through.]
185: 2162| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2165| [45] ["... I know I'm in no place to speak so arrogantly like this, but I'd like Captain Kasasagi to reconsider his ways once more."]
187: 2173| [47] [Ukita]
188: 2176| [45] ["I can understand why he'd obsess over completing the mission in light of how it's created so many victims already, but still..."]
189: 2184| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2187| [45] ["... That blockhead's not gonna change his mind that easily, I'd say."]
191: 2244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2247| [45] ["Watase's still on board with 'Q'. As long as he's fixated on revenge, there's probably no changing his mind..."]
193: 2252| [45] [It was probably already an internalized belief to Watase.]
194: 2257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 2258| [45] [(... No, isn't it more than that...?)]
196: 2312| [45] [In the deepest depths of Watase's mind lay a hatred and fear of Communicators.]
197: 2317| [45] [And Natsuhiko had a "power" that Watase feared.]
198: 2322| [45] [And perhaps as long as Natsuhiko would use that power, he and Watase would never be able to come to mutual understanding.]
199: 2362| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2363| [45] [(... But even so, this is the path I chose.)]
201: 2368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2369| [45] [(To protect Yuuri, I have no choice... but to keep using this power and casting strict words at Watase until he changes his beliefs.)]
203: 2374| [45] [And perhaps if he couldn't do that, then Natsuhiko and Watase would never come to mutual understanding for all eternity.]
204: 2379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2380| [45] [(Will the antagonism between Communicators and ordinary people continue forever, in the same way that the two of us can't come to terms...?)]
206: 2385| [45] [The thought made Natsuhiko depressed.]
207: 2411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2414| [45] ["... Mr. Ukita, will there ever come a time in society where Communicators and ordinary people can come to terms with each other?"]
209: 2422| [47] [Natsuhiko]
210: 2425| [45] ["That's what the research in LABO was really meant to accomplish, wasn't it?"]
211: 2451| [47] [Ukita]
212: 2454| [45] ["Mmm... Naturally, that's what I believe in, but... that's not what the high ranking officials at LABO think."]
213: 2462| [47] [Ukita]
214: 2465| [45] ["The reason we devote ourselves to BC research is ostensibly for the benefit of public order and to prevent societal insecurity, but--"]
215: 2473| [47] [Ukita]
216: 2476| [45] ["The real motivation is, in short, money."]
217: 2484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2487| [45] ["Money?"]
219: 2513| [47] [Ukita]
220: 2516| [45] ["Indeed. LABO conducts world-leading BC research and sells their results to various countries."]
221: 2525| [47] [Ukita]
222: 2528| [45] ["You see, there's this foreign company called 'Betelgeuse New Treatments' that's a patron of LABO and Rokumei City. The three of them are co-conspirators in a money-making scheme."]
223: 2536| [47] [Ukita]
224: 2539| [45] ["If that weren't the case, LABO wouldn't even dare conduct research on confined test subjects."]
225: 2547| [47] [Ukita]
226: 2550| [45] ["If it were really for the sake of public order, they could just simply confine them. Maybe even let them live a peaceful life on an uninhabited island."]
227: 2576| [47] [Ukita]
228: 2579| [45] ["But they don't. They use them for human experimentation. That said, the masterminds behind it all wouldn't just lay their true intentions out on the table, would they?"]
229: 2587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 2590| [45] ["... That makes me sick."]
231: 2616| [47] [Ukita]
232: 2619| [45] ["Indeed. That's why it's actually more favorable for them to aggravate the antagonism between Communicators and ordinary people, so--"]
233: 2624| [45] [Just then, Yuuri interrupted Ukita before he could continue.]
234: 2651| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 2654| [45] ["No, Mr. Ukita... in the past, there were people who indeed conducted research for the sake of public order."]
236: 2662| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2665| [45] ["Huh?"]
238: 2714| [47] [Ukita]
239: 2717| [45] ["For example?"]
240: 2774| [47] [Yuuri]
241: 2777| [45] ["For example, there's AD."]
242: 2833| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 2836| [45] ["AD's formal name is 'Alone Desire'-- in other words, a drug for those who 'desire solitude'."]
244: 2844| [47] [Yuuri]
245: 2847| [45] ["A drug to reject BC, the power to connect people."]
246: 2870| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 2873| [45] ["...!"]
248: 2878| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
249: 2883| [45] [True enough, with continued dosage of AD, a Communicator would be no different from an ordinary person.]
250: 2888| [45] [Or used the other way around, an ordinary person could come in contact with Communicators without fear.]
251: 2921| [47] [Yuuri]
252: 2924| [45] ["If AD became widespread, then Communicators would no longer be seen to be as special as they are today... I've heard that was the reason for the development of the drug."]
253: 2950| [47] [Ukita]
254: 2953| [45] ["Y-you say that, but I worked my way up in LABO all the way to Junior Fellow status, yet I've never heard that AD was developed for that purpose at all."]
255: 2979| [47] [Yuuri]
256: 2982| [45] ["I can imagine... AD has apparently been continuously in development ever since LABO was established."]
257: 2990| [47] [Yuuri]
258: 2993| [45] ["What I believe happened is that over the course of several years, LABO's ethics shed little by little until the original purpose of AD was forgotten."]
259: 3001| [47] [Yuuri]
260: 3004| [45] ["I'm not exactly sure what was on the developer's mind when they gave AD its name at the start of its development, but--"]
261: 3030| [47] [Yuuri]
262: 3033| [45] ["Don't you think they put their feelings into the name, regardless of what those feelings were?"]
263: 3059| [47] [Ukita]
264: 3062| [45] ["Hmm... I think that's a little overly sentimental, but..."]
265: 3067| [45] [Ukita didn't completely reject Yuuri's line of thought.]
266: 3072| [45] [Natsuhiko likewise just barely agreed.]
267: 3080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 3083| [45] ["But are there any other examples besides that?"]
269: 3109| [47] [Yuuri]
270: 3112| [45] ["There are... The fact of the matter is that the WX particle amplifier itself is one."]
271: 3169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 3172| [45] ["The amplifier? What part of that thing's supposed to bridge the gap between Communicators and ordinary people?"]
273: 3177| [45] [Yuuri calmly replied.]
274: 3195| [47] [Yuuri]
275: 3198| [45] ["... Hikorin, do you understand exactly what the WX particle amplifier is?"]
276: 3206| [47] [Yuuri]
277: 3209| [45] ["It amplifies the energy content of BC particles..."]
278: 3217| [47] [Natsuhiko]
279: 3220| [45] ["...?"]
280: 3253| [47] [Yuuri]
281: 3256| [45] ["The energy content of BC particles rises when a Communicator uses BC, remember?"]
282: 3264| [47] [Yuuri]
283: 3267| [45] ["The information energy created inside their brain is emitted outside."]
284: 3275| [47] [Yuuri]
285: 3278| [45] ["Which in other words means...?"]
286: 3283| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped in surprise.]
287: 3291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
288: 3294| [45] ["No way...!"]
289: 3299| [45] [BC particles had the property of transmitting and propagating the information energy of living creatures' thoughts.]
290: 3304| [45] [In which case, amplifying their energy meant--]
291: 3330| [47] [Yuuri]
292: 3333| [45] ["... You see, there is a kind of artificial brain inside of that machine."]
293: 3338| [45] [Yuuri calmly made that statement.]
294: 3346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
295: 3349| [45] ["A-an artificial brain...!?"]
296: 3375| [47] [Ukita]
297: 3378| [45] ["Is such a thing even possible with modern technology!?"]
298: 3404| [47] [Yuuri]
299: 3407| [45] ["Creating an entire brain from scratch would indeed be difficult. So a more fitting way to describe it would be--"]
300: 3416| [47] [Yuuri]
301: 3419| [45] ["A device that mimics the BC receptor alone-- an 'artificial BC receptor'."]
302: 3473| [45] [--A BC receptor. The organ relating to BC usage located in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain.]
303: 3478| [45] [Natsuhiko had heard about it once in one of Ena's lectures.]
304: 3486| [47] [Natsuhiko]
305: 3489| [45] ["Is that... true?"]
306: 3523| [47] [Yuuri]
307: 3526| [45] ["Unmistakably. After all, we test subjects had always cooperated in the research and development of that machine."]
308: 3534| [47] [Natsuhiko]
309: 3537| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
310: 3545| [47] [Yuuri]
311: 3548| [45] ["That machine was constructed 14 years ago, when LABO was established."]
312: 3556| [47] [Yuuri]
313: 3559| [45] ["It was built based off of the data obtained from the first test subject, Subject 'A', and improved based on the data obtained from the other test subjects."]
314: 3585| [47] [Yuuri]
315: 3588| [45] ["Ms. A passed away before I came to LABO, and N and I never had the opportunity to meet face-to-face, but--"]
316: 3614| [47] [Yuuri]
317: 3617| [45] ["That machine is constructed from the data we produced. The BC we used. Its foundation was built from parts of our very minds."]
318: 3625| [47] [Yuuri]
319: 3628| [45] ["And what was made was a machine that only generates powerful information energy.%NWithout a will. Without a spirit..."]
320: 3636| [47] [Yuuri]
321: 3639| [45] ["The generation of WX particles is, so to speak, the transmission of BC without any sort of message imbued within."]
322: 3647| [47] [Yuuri]
323: 3650| [45] ["All that exists within is a vague 'feeling'."]
324: 3658| [47] [Yuuri]
325: 3661| [45] ["That feeling is the primal objective of the ability known as BC. The desire 'to connect people'..."]
326: 3669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
327: 3672| [45] ["... Is that what it was...?"]
328: 3677| [45] [Natsuhiko noticed that what Yuuri said was the answer to a question he hadn't even considered up until then:]
329: 3682| [45] [Why would an environment full of WX particles increase the efficiency of BC use?]
330: 3687| [45] [The answer was that WX particles themselves were filled with the desire to "connect people".]
331: 3713| [47] [Yuuri]
332: 3716| [45] ["... But you know, WX particle energy is too strong."]
333: 3724| [47] [Yuuri]
334: 3727| [45] ["They cause damage when they enter the human brain. They also affect the genes, causing mutations."]
335: 3735| [47] [Yuuri]
336: 3738| [45] ["The 'desire' that WX particles have is to connect people. Even if it causes pain.%NEven if it recreates their bodies."]
337: 3746| [47] [Natsuhiko]
338: 3749| [45] ["So the cases where WX particle exposure caused aptitude to rise... were because of that?"]
339: 3757| [47] [Yuuri]
340: 3760| [45] ["Yes... Though the number of people who can withstand that change is exceedingly small..."]
341: 3786| [47] [Yuuri]
342: 3789| [45] ["... But this effect definitely has the most potential to bridge the gap between Communicators and ordinary people."]
343: 3797| [47] [Yuuri]
344: 3800| [45] ["After all, though it's compatible with only a very select few people, that machine is still able to create 'acquired' Communicators."]
345: 3808| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 3811| [45] ["!!"]
347: 3819| [47] [Yuuri]
348: 3822| [45] ["The WX particle amplifier has the opposite use of AD. It's a machine that can turn ordinary people into Communicators."]
349: 3848| [47] [Yuuri]
350: 3851| [45] ["'Perhaps someday, everyone on Earth could become a Communicator through use of that machine.'"]
351: 3859| [47] [Yuuri]
352: 3862| [45] ["'And thus the disputes between Communicators and normal people will come to an end.'"]
353: 3867| [45] [Apparently some people in LABO thought that way...]
354: 3893| [47] [Yuuri]
355: 3896| [45] ["... But do you think that's really a good thing?"]
356: 3922| [47] [Yuuri]
357: 3925| [45] ["Say, Hikorin. I believe... that a society like that would be extremely unnatural."]
358: 3933| [47] [Yuuri]
359: 3936| [45] ["That maybe we should all try to understand each other, without relying on this power of ours..."]
360: 3958| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 3961| [45] ["... Yeah. I think so too."]
362: 3969| [47] [Natsuhiko]
363: 3972| [45] ["Because BC is a terrifying power where one wrong use could spell disaster for society..."]
364: 3977| [45] [If at all possible, it would be better for people to come to a mutual understanding without relying on that power.]
365: 3982| [45] [The same went for Natsuhiko and Watase.]
366: 4070| [45] [Erasing Watase's memory would return him to the just man he once was. One that would probably not conflict with Natsuhiko's intentions.]
367: 4075| [45] [But that would not amount to true understanding with Watase at all.]
368: 4099| [45] [People change with just the slightest distortion of memory. Going so far as to erase their memory would be the same as killing their mind.]
369: 4104| [45] [And that was something Natsuhiko wanted to avoid.]
370: 4128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
371: 4129| [45] [(So I'll believe... that Watase will change his mind even if I don't erase his memories.)]
372: 4134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 4135| [45] [(That in time, he'll abandon Q's mission and release Yuuri...!)]
374: 4140| [45] [Even if that was just wishful thinking, Natsuhiko still wagered on that hope.]
375: 4156| [45] [And as Natsuhiko pondered to himself, Yuuri sadly murmured.]
376: 4182| [47] [Yuuri]
377: 4185| [45] ["... But in any case, Hikorin... For some reason or another, we've acquired an ability that's more than we can handle, haven't we?"]
378: 4193| [47] [Yuuri]
379: 4196| [45] ["In some ways, maybe it's only natural for normal people to fear us..."]
380: 4204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
381: 4207| [45] ["Yeah... Maybe we'd have been better off not acquiring such power unfitting of our stature."]
382: 4215| [47] [Natsuhiko]
383: 4218| [45] ["But if there is some sort of meaning in us getting this power... then I'd at least like to use it correctly."]
384: 4251| [45] [Despite his answer, Natsuhiko still did not fully understand.]
385: 4256| [45] [What was the meaning behind him getting that power? What exactly was the "correct" way to use BC?]
386: 4261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 4262| [45] [(... But at the very least, freeing everyone from malice like this... is probably the correct thing to do.)]
388: 4267| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko had that thought,]
389: 4276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
390: 4279| [45] ["Yuuri... What are you trying to say?"]
391: 4305| [47] [Yuuri]
392: 4308| [45] ["Well... I don't want you to erase Captain Kasasagi's memory."]
393: 4316| [47] [Natsuhiko]
394: 4319| [45] ["Huh!?"]
395: 4345| [47] [Yuuri]
396: 4348| [45] ["Even Captain Kasasagi could possibly come to an understanding if we talk it out.%NHe can change his mind naturally, right?"]
397: 4374| [47] [Yuuri]
398: 4377| [45] ["But using Senses Sympathy is a completely different matter."]
399: 4385| [47] [Yuuri]
400: 4388| [45] ["People change with just the slightest distortion of memory, you know... I think that erasing their memory would be the same as killing their mind."]
401: 4393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
402: 4394| [45] [(...!)]
403: 4399| [45] [Yuuri's lonely words struck Natsuhiko in the heart.]
404: 4404| [45] [--For the same had happened to him as well.]
405: 4455| [45] [The memories Yuuri had fabricated had caused Natsuhiko to live with a phantom for nine years.]
406: 4460| [45] [The things Subject N and Natsuhiko had done were the same as well.]
407: 4509| [45] [Subject N's distortion of Watase's memory transfigured him into a homicidal demon.]
408: 4558| [45] [And when Natsuhiko erased his memories, Watase subsequently became a just rescue worker.]
409: 4563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
410: 4564| [45] [(... People's personalities are formed from their memories...)]
411: 4569| [47] [Natsuhiko]
412: 4570| [45] [(So erasing someone's memories is the same as killing them mentally?)]
413: 4585| [45] [As Natsuhiko fell silent, Yuuri continued.]
414: 4611| [47] [Yuuri]
415: 4614| [45] ["... For some reason or another, we've acquired an ability that's more than we can handle, haven't we?"]
416: 4622| [47] [Yuuri]
417: 4625| [45] ["The power to touch people's minds and manipulate them freely... Quite the terrifying power."]
418: 4651| [47] [Yuuri]
419: 4654| [45] ["If we use that power for our own gain without any hesitation, then that means we really are...!"]
420: 4659| [45] [--"Monsters", just like Watase had said, perhaps.]
421: 4664| [45] [Even if they weren't lumps of malice like Subject N, they would be entities quite close to her.]
422: 4669| [45] [But even so-- Natsuhiko shook his head at Yuuri's words.]
423: 4677| [47] [Natsuhiko]
424: 4680| [45] ["... But even so, I'd do it all for you."]
425: 4706| [47] [Yuuri]
426: 4709| [45] ["No...!"]
427: 4717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
428: 4720| [45] ["Seriously, think about it. At this rate, Watase's going to take you away at end."]
429: 4728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
430: 4731| [45] ["Let me ask you once more... Yuuri, are you sure you're okay with that?"]
431: 4757| [47] [Yuuri]
432: 4760| [45] ["..."]
433: 4768| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 4771| [45] ["The only way to set you free is for Watase to change his mind."]
435: 4779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
436: 4782| [45] ["It'd be great if he himself reconsidered by the time we leave LABO, but..."]
437: 4790| [47] [Natsuhiko]
438: 4793| [45] ["If that doesn't happen, then I'll take matters into my own hand and--"]
439: 4826| [45] [But before Natsuhiko could finish his sentence,]
440: 4839| [45] [a sound rang out from outside the door.]
441: 4859| [47] [Natsuhiko]
442: 4860| [45] [(!?)]
443: 4867| [45] [Natsuhiko and the others gasped and turned around.]
444: 4875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
445: 4878| [45] ["... Who's there? Watase?"]
446: 4883| [45] [No answer.]
447: 4918| [45] [But they could hear a sound like someone pounding on the wall outside.]
448: 4959| [47] [Yuuri]
449: 4962| [45] ["Did Ms. Tachibana or someone else realize the existence of the shelter...?"]
450: 4970| [47] [Ukita]
451: 4973| [45] ["Wait, but even if that's the case, nobody but us should know the password."]
452: 4999| [47] [Ukita]
453: 5002| [45] ["Even in the off chance that someone remembered the keypad on the wall and repaired it, they wouldn't be able to come in."]
454: 5007| [45] [The kids were relieved at Ukita's statement, but immediately afterwards--]
455: 5053| [45] [The screeching sound of metal cutting metal echoed from the other side of the door.]
