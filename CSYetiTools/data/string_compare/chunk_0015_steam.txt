  1:   60| [45] [By the time Watase's group made it back to the inner ring, Ena and the others were waiting to greet them.]
  2:  122| [47] [Ena]
  3:  125| [45] ["D-did something happen? I thought I heard an explosion or something."]
  4:  133| [47] [Watase]
  5:  136| [45] ["Well, you see, there was this backdraft, and..."]
  6:  141| [45] [--Watase informed Ena, Ukita, and Yuuri of what'd transpired back in the outer ring.]
  7:  168| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  171| [45] ["There was that much fire in the outer ring...!?"]
  9:  179| [47] [Watase]
 10:  182| [45] ["What's wrong, Mr. Ukita? You seem rather surprised."]
 11:  208| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  211| [45] ["No, it's not that... just thinking about how the fire's spread further than I'd imagined."]
 13:  239| [47] [Jun]
 14:  242| [45] ["Damn straight. If I'd known it'd spread that far, I probably wouldn't have gone myself and left you guys behind."]
 15:  250| [47] [Watase]
 16:  253| [45] ["I'm also to blame for what happened... sorry, Mr. Ukita."]
 17:  279| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  282| [45] ["Let's not dwell on it. It's more important that we make haste with the search, is it not?"]
 19:  308| [47] [Jun]
 20:  311| [45] ["Then let's get moving on to floor B1 on the dou... wait, what the heck?"]
 21:  316| [45] [A puzzled look formed on Jun's face before she could finish her sentence.]
 22:  342| [47] [Jun]
 23:  345| [45] ["Hey, Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita... where's Yuuri?"]
 24:  371| [47] [Ena]
 25:  374| [45] ["--Huh!?"]
 26:  413| [45] [Taken aback with shock, everyone looked around them.]
 27:  418| [45] [But Yuuri was nowhere to be found.]
 28:  478| [47] [Watase]
 29:  481| [45] ["Wh-where did she go!?"]
 30:  507| [47] [Ena]
 31:  510| [45] ["I don't know! She was right here with us a minute ago!"]
 32:  536| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  539| [45] ["I swear, I had my eyes on her until just a little while back!"]
 34:  565| [47] [Jun]
 35:  568| [45] ["Then she ran away!? But why!?"]
 36:  594| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  597| [45] ["I don't know, but this is bad... it's too dangerous to wander around alone in this place!"]
 38:  685| [47] [Ena]
 39:  688| [45] ["...!"]
 40:  693| [45] [Ena gasped sharply at Kazami's words.]
 41:  698| [45] [Watase saw what appeared to be a look of guilt cover her face.]
 42:  706| [47] [Watase]
 43:  709| [45] ["Teach, we need to look for her now!"]
 44:  735| [47] [Ena]
 45:  738| [45] ["Y-you're right... She couldn't have gotten far!"]
 46:  780| [45] [The two of them exchanged glances and simultaneously broke off into a run.]
 47:  834| [45] [They heard the other members of the group talking and taking off running soon after.]
 48:  842| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  845| [45] ["Moribe, Mr. Ukita, let's search too!"]
 50:  853| [47] [Jun]
 51:  856| [45] ["Roger!"]
 52:  864| [47] [Ukita]
 53:  867| [45] ["Right, let's hurry!"]
 54:  950| [45] [Watase turned to Ena as they dashed through the hallway.]
 55:  958| [47] [Watase]
 56:  961| [45] ["Where do you think Yuuri ran off!?"]
 57:  987| [47] [Ena]
 58:  990| [45] ["I-I don't know! But-- I don't think I heard any security gates opening or anything like that..."]
 59:  995| [45] [It was then that Watase realized it.]
 60: 1000| [45] [The security gates and doors to each laboratory made a loud sound whenever they opened or closed.]
 61: 1005| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1006| [45] [(--You need to go through a security gate to get out of this area.)]
 63: 1011| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1012| [45] [(And Yuuri most likely doesn't have a card, which means that she probably can't get out of this area.)]
 65: 1020| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1023| [45] ["Did you hear the doors to any of the smaller rooms opening up?"]
 67: 1049| [47] [Ena]
 68: 1052| [45] ["No, not at all!"]
 69: 1060| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1063| [45] ["So that means--"]
 71: 1068| [45] [There was only one answer.]
 72: 1073| [45] [Ena's head suddenly shot upwards.]
 73: 1100| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1103| [45] ["--She's gotta be heading for the staircase!"]
 75: 1108| [45] [Unlike the mechanical sliding doors that stood in front of every other room, the stairwells had normal fireproof doors.]
 76: 1113| [45] [If you were careful enough to open that door without making a sound, you could get away without anyone noticing.]
 77: 1121| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1124| [45] ["Let's go!"]
 79: 1150| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1153| [45] ["Yes!"]
 81: 1158| [45] [The two nodded at each other and headed for the emergency staircase.]
 82: 1245| [45] [When they got there--]
 83: 1253| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1256| [45] ["Found her!"]
 85: 1261| [45] [Yuuri was standing in that dim room.]
 86: 1398| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1401| [45] ["!"]
 88: 1406| [45] [Yuuri froze with a jolt.]
 89: 1417| [45] [Watase and Ena ran up the staircase and grabbed Yuuri by the arm.]
 90: 1530| [47] [Yuuri]
 91: 1533| [45] ["Ah..."]
 92: 1541| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1544| [45] ["Yuuri, don't go running off like that without saying anything... you had us all worried."]
 94: 1549| [45] [Watase gently put his hand on Yuuri's shoulder.]
 95: 1554| [45] [Yuuri hung her head like a dog that'd been scolded.]
 96: 1637| [47] [Ena]
 97: 1640| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri, why'd you run away from us?"]
 98: 1666| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1669| [45] ["Uh, um..."]
100: 1677| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1680| [45] ["Er... I... got scared..."]
102: 1688| [47] [Watase]
103: 1691| [45] ["Scared?"]
104: 1717| [47] [Ena]
105: 1720| [45] ["Scared... of what?"]
106: 1746| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1749| [45] ["W-well..."]
108: 1757| [47] [Watase]
109: 1760| [45] ["Listen Yuuri, we're not mad at you. You can answer Teach's question."]
110: 1765| [45] [Watase let go of her arm and spoke with a kind voice.]
111: 1770| [45] [Yuuri then nervously started talking as if she'd finally prepared herself.]
112: 1796| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 1799| [45] ["W-well... because of that explosion I heard..."]
114: 1807| [47] [Ena]
115: 1810| [45] ["Explosion? So you're saying you got scared by that sound and ran all the way here?"]
116: 1818| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1821| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
118: 1844| [45] [Watase and Ena looked at each other.]
119: 1852| [47] [Watase]
120: 1855| [45] ["... Looks like she's quite the scaredy cat."]
121: 1863| [47] [Ena]
122: 1866| [45] ["... Yes."]
123: 1910| [45] [Watase gave a wry smile and turned back to the door.]
124: 1918| [47] [Watase]
125: 1921| [45] ["Heeey, guys! We found Yuuri!"]
126: 1938| [45] [--It wasn't long before they heard the sound of Kazami and the others running over.]
127: 1943| [45] [As soon as she got there, Kazami gave Yuuri a stern glare.]
128: 1986| [47] [Kazami]
129: 1989| [45] ["You can't go wandering off by yourself, Ms. Yuuri!"]
130: 2050| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 2053| [45] ["!!"]
132: 2061| [47] [Kazami]
133: 2064| [45] ["Didn't I tell you it was dangerous!? I'll get mad if you do something like that ever again, you hear me!?"]
134: 2090| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 2093| [45] ["U-Um... I'm sor..."]
136: 2098| [45] [Yuuri's voice trembled in the face of Kazami's harsh scolding.]
137: 2103| [45] [Watase quickly cut in.]
138: 2111| [47] [Watase]
139: 2114| [45] ["H-hold on, Tachibana! You shouldn't yell at her so much!"]
140: 2140| [47] [Kazami]
141: 2143| [45] ["What was that?"]
142: 2151| [47] [Watase]
143: 2154| [45] ["It appears that Yuuri was frightened by the sound of the backdraft I caused and just started running without even thinking."]
144: 2162| [47] [Watase]
145: 2165| [45] ["So basically, it's my fault. So... if you could ease up on the yelling..."]
146: 2170| [45] [Watase said this nervously, seeing as how he'd been on the end of a scolding from Kazami himself just a few minutes ago. A troubled look appeared on her face.]
147: 2196| [47] [Kazami]
148: 2199| [45] ["So that's what happened... but it's still more dangerous to go off on your own."]
149: 2227| [47] [Jun]
150: 2230| [45] ["She's right, Yuuri. You'll be more safe with us than anywhere else."]
151: 2256| [47] [Ukita]
152: 2259| [45] ["I'm in the same situation as you are, and I too think it'd be best to listen to the professionals."]
153: 2285| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2288| [45] ["I-I'm sorry..."]
155: 2293| [45] [Yuuri was practically shrinking after having every adult in the room scold her at once.]
156: 2301| [47] [Watase]
157: 2304| [45] ["C'mon guys... we were already gonna go to floor B1 anyway, so why don't we just thank Yuuri for saving us some time?"]
158: 2330| [47] [Kazami]
159: 2333| [45] ["You're being too soft, Captain! If something like this happens again, then we may find a body instead next time!"]
160: 2341| [47] [Watase]
161: 2344| [45] ["I get that, but Yuuri's learned her lesson by now, right Yuuri?"]
162: 2352| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 2355| [45] ["... Yes."]
164: 2360| [45] [She said this in a nearly inaudible voice.]
165: 2365| [45] [Even Kazami looked a bit embarrassed at herself.]
166: 2391| [47] [Kazami]
167: 2394| [45] ["... As long as you understand, then that's all I ask. Shall we go, then?"]
168: 2437| [45] [Kazami took Yuuri's hand and ascended the staircase.]
169: 2442| [45] [Jun and Ukita followed after them.]
170: 2447| [45] [Last but not least, Watase and Ena began to walk up the stairs. Just then--]
171: 2509| [47] [Ena]
172: 2512| [45] ["... Captain Kasasagi?"]
173: 2517| [45] [Ena grabbed Watase's hand and whispered that.]
174: 2525| [47] [Watase]
175: 2528| [45] ["Hmm, what is it?"]
176: 2536| [47] [Ena]
177: 2539| [45] ["About Ms. Yuuri... is it just me, or did she just freeze on the spot as soon as she saw you when we were chasing her?"]
178: 2547| [47] [Watase]
179: 2550| [45] ["Huh? Yeah, you're right..."]
180: 2555| [45] [Watase suddenly remembered something just as he said that.]
181: 2560| [45] [How she'd reacted earlier, and her attitude up until this point.]
182: 2568| [47] [Watase]
183: 2571| [45] ["... Actually, to be honest, I don't think she's liked me from the moment we met."]
184: 2579| [47] [Ena]
185: 2582| [45] ["She doesn't like you? Why?"]
186: 2590| [47] [Watase]
187: 2593| [45] ["Beats the hell out of me... What could it be?"]
188: 2598| [45] [Watase started to wonder if Yuuri had a problem with him or something.]
189: 2603| [45] [He looked at Ena's face and asked:]
190: 2611| [47] [Watase]
191: 2614| [45] ["Hey Teach, is my face scary?"]
192: 2640| [47] [Ena]
193: 2643| [45] ["Scary... No, not really. Well, you look the same you always do; like a bit of a dunce."]
194: 2651| [47] [Watase]
195: 2654| [45] ["Ghh... g-gee, thanks."]
196: 2659| [45] [Watase asked another question as he felt the pain of Ena's retort in his heart.]
197: 2667| [47] [Watase]
198: 2670| [45] ["But then I guess it's not a problem with my face. So what could it be?"]
199: 2678| [47] [Ena]
200: 2681| [45] ["What indeed. Got any ideas?"]
201: 2689| [47] [Watase]
202: 2692| [45] ["Mmm, nope, nothing..."]
203: 2700| [47] [Watase]
204: 2703| [45] ["But hey, you're a teacher, right? Has a student ever disliked you for no reason?"]
205: 2726| [45] [Ena looked confused about Watase's question.]
206: 2734| [47] [Ena]
207: 2737| [45] ["Of course not. My students love me."]
208: 2745| [47] [Watase]
209: 2748| [45] ["... Oh really. Then what's your secret?"]
210: 2774| [47] [Ena]
211: 2777| [45] ["Good question. Well, if I had to say, it's because I shower my students with unconditional love."]
212: 2785| [47] [Watase]
213: 2788| [45] ["Love?"]
214: 2796| [47] [Ena]
215: 2799| [45] ["Yep, love."]
216: 2825| [47] [Ena]
217: 2828| [45] ["I always put the kids first, keep an eye on them... and I always make sure to spare no effort."]
218: 2836| [47] [Ena]
219: 2839| [45] ["Even it's a bit pushy, your feelings will come through to others so long as you actually think about them from the bottom of your heart."]
220: 2847| [47] [Watase]
221: 2850| [45] ["Huh, so that's it."]
222: 2855| [45] [He couldn't say anything for sure since he didn't know what the normal Ena's relationship with her students was like, but he decided to keep that advice in mind.]
223: 2860| [45] [But at the same time, he noticed a gaping hole in Ena's speech and decided to exploit it.]
224: 2868| [47] [Watase]
225: 2871| [45] ["... But you know, for a teacher who 'always keeps an eye on the kids', you sure did a great job on noticing Yuuri had run away."]
226: 2897| [47] [Ena]
227: 2900| [45] ["Ouch, you just had to hit me right where it hurt. Feeling a bit down now, not gonna lie."]
228: 2908| [47] [Watase]
229: 2911| [45] ["Well, let's just make sure we -both- keep an eye on Yuuri from now on."]
230: 2937| [47] [Ena]
231: 2940| [45] ["Hmph, I don't want to hear that coming from you."]
232: 2945| [45] [The two of them reached the top of the stairs by the time Ena finished saying that--]
233: 2950| [45] [And officially reached floor B1.]
234: 2961| [47] [Watase]
235: 2964| [45] ["Let's get to searching, guys!"]
236: 3037| [47] [All]
237: 3040| [45] ["Yeah!"]
238: 3045| [45] [And with that, the five of them split up to search for Yuuri.]
239: 3093| [45] [Watase decided to begin by searching in the direction of Area 2.]
240: 3141| [45] [But there was no sign of Yuuri there.]
241: 3149| [47] [Watase]
242: 3152| [45] ["Dammit, she didn't go this way!?"]
243: 3200| [45] [He then turned around and chose to head back to Area 3.]
244: 3278| [45] [When he got there, he saw Kazami and Ena.]
245: 3286| [47] [Watase]
246: 3289| [45] ["Did you find her!?"]
247: 3366| [47] [Ena]
248: 3369| [45] ["No, no luck!"]
249: 3377| [47] [Kazami]
250: 3380| [45] ["Where could she have gone...!?"]
251: 3385| [45] [Just as Watase started to think about where Yuuri could have run off to, he heard Jun's voice.]
252: 3426| [47] [Jun]
253: 3429| [45] ["Found 'er! Guys, I found her!"]
254: 3434| [45] [Her voice was coming from the direction of the emergency staircase.]
255: 3442| [47] [Watase]
256: 3445| [45] ["The B1 staircase!"]
257: 3450| [45] [Watase said that and raced for the emergency staircase.]
258: 3455| [45] [Kazami and Ena followed suit.]
259: 3509| [45] [They then reached the stairwell and quickly ascended it--]
260: 3517| [47] [Watase]
261: 3520| [45] ["There she is!"]
262: 3525| [45] [to find Yuuri there.]
263: 3589| [47] [Yuuri]
264: 3592| [45] ["Ah..."]
265: 3597| [45] [She stared at Watase in what appeared to be fright as she stood in the darkness.]
266: 3704| [45] [Jun and Ukita were right there with her.]
267: 3709| [45] [At that moment, Kazami started yelling sternly.]
268: 3836| [47] [Kazami]
269: 3839| [45] ["You can't go wandering off by yourself, Ms. Yuuri!"]
270: 3900| [47] [Yuuri]
271: 3903| [45] ["!!"]
272: 3911| [47] [Kazami]
273: 3914| [45] ["Didn't I tell you it was dangerous!? I'll get mad if you do something like that ever again, you hear me!?"]
274: 3940| [47] [Yuuri]
275: 3943| [45] ["U-Um... I'm sor..."]
276: 3948| [45] [Yuuri's voice trembled in the face of Kazami's harsh scolding.]
277: 3956| [47] [Watase]
278: 3959| [45] ["H-hold on, calm down, Tachibana!"]
279: 3987| [47] [Jun]
280: 3990| [45] ["No, she's right."]
281: 3998| [47] [Jun]
282: 4001| [45] ["Yuuri, why'd you leave Ms. Tsubakiyama and Mr. Ukita?"]
283: 4027| [47] [Yuuri]
284: 4030| [45] ["U-um..."]
285: 4035| [45] [Yuuri appeared to be at a loss for an answer for a while, but then finally answered as if she'd prepared herself.]
286: 4061| [47] [Yuuri]
287: 4064| [45] ["I heard that explosion... and then I got scared..."]
288: 4090| [47] [Ena]
289: 4093| [45] ["I don't blame you... but you'll be in more danger if you go off on your own."]
290: 4119| [47] [Ukita]
291: 4122| [45] ["Don't you think that it'd be safer to stay with all of us?"]
292: 4148| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 4151| [45] ["I-I'm sorry..."]
294: 4156| [45] [Yuuri was practically shrinking after having every adult in the room scold her at once.]
295: 4164| [47] [Watase]
296: 4167| [45] ["C'mon guys... we were already gonna go to floor B1 anyway, so why don't we just thank Yuuri for saving us some time?"]
