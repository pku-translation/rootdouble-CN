  0:   68| [45] [Kazami and the others continued the search after they found Dojima's body.]
  1:   73| [45] [But just one hour later--]
  2:  132| [45] [They were faced with the death of yet another one of their coworkers.]
  3:  168| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  171| [45] ["No... no..."]
  5:  176| [47] [Jun]
  6:  179| [45] ["Hiyama, not you too...!"]
  7:  184| [45] [--It appeared that Hiyama had burned to death after both his legs had been broken.]
  8:  189| [45] [Kazami and Jun weren't alone: Ena, Ukita, and Yuuri were also all incredibly shaken up by that sight.]
  9:  275| [45] [--Kazami stuck to her firm attitude in order to calm the others down.]
 10:  280| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  283| [45] ["... Dying in the line of duty is an unavoidable risk in this line of work."]
 12:  309| [47] [Watase]
 13:  312| [45] ["But Tachibana..."]
 14:  317| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  320| [45] ["Please don't say anything, Captain."]
 16:  325| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  328| [45] ["We can save our grief for after we've rescued the survivors and gotten outside."]
 18:  333| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  336| [45] ["You have to do the same, Moribe..."]
 20:  341| [45] [Once Kazami had said that, Jun was the next to tearfully speak.]
 21:  419| [47] [Jun]
 22:  422| [45] ["But... today was the first time... I've ever lost a coworker on the job..."]
 23:  448| [47] [Jun]
 24:  451| [45] ["And now... it's happened... again..."]
 25:  456| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  459| [45] ["I know. But you have to hold your head high. You discarded your womanhood when you joined Sirius. Remember that."]
 27:  485| [47] [Jun]
 28:  488| [45] ["But... Sis...!"]
 29:  493| [45] [Jun choked back a sob.]
 30:  526| [45] [Kazami didn't scold her for calling her "Sis".]
 31:  531| [45] [It took everything she had to hold back the tumult of emotions raging in her heart.]
 32:  536| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  537| [45] [(I have to endure it... I have to lead everyone...!)]
 34:  591| [45] [But just as Kazami thought that-- Watase spoke up.]
 35:  624| [47] [Watase]
 36:  627| [45] ["Tachibana, Moribe... can I have a minute?"]
 37:  632| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  635| [45] ["Huh?"]
 39:  661| [47] [Watase]
 40:  664| [45] ["We're changing leaders. I'll lead the group from this point onwards."]
 41:  697| [47] [Jun]
 42:  700| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 43: 1074| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1077| [45] ["It really is a shame about Hiyama... but we can't afford to waste any time."]
 45: 1125| [47] [Watase]
 46: 1128| [45] ["The AD's effects will wear off, and we barely have any on us."]
 47: 1191| [47] [Watase]
 48: 1194| [45] ["This may sound harsh... but we have to survive."]
 49: 1261| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 50: 1314| [47] [Watase]
 51: 1317| [45] ["Oh come on, I'm just restoring the status quo, that's all."]
 52: 1343| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1346| [45] ["Anyway, just rely on me for a while. Especially you, Tachibana-- you've been carrying far too heavy a burden up until now."]
 54: 1351| [47] [Kazami]
 55: 1352| [45] ["..."]
 56: 1357| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase.]
 57: 1362| [47] [Kazami]
 58: 1363| [45] [(No way, but... I have to...! I'm the leader right now! That's my responsibility!)]
 59: 1368| [47] [Kazami]
 60: 1369| [45] [(There's no way I can entrust all that to the hands of someone who's lost his memories...!)]
 61: 1374| [45] [But Watase beat Kazami to the punch before she could say anything.]
 62: 1401| [47] [Watase]
 63: 1404| [45] ["Didn't you hear me? Then let me make it an order-- as Sirius' captain."]
 64: 1430| [47] [Watase]
 65: 1433| [45] ["As of this point onwards, Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana and Ensign Jun Moribe will hereby defer to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command!"]
 66: 1480| [47] [Kazami & Jun]
 67: 1483| [45] ["!!"]
 68: 1488| [45] [Kazami shuddered at those words.]
 69: 1493| [45] [His voice, the look on his face-- they were that of the usual Watase.]
 70: 1519| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1522| [45] ["Now let me hear you say it!"]
 72: 1527| [47] [Kazami]
 73: 1530| [45] ["Sir! Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana deferring to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command, sir!"]
 74: 1556| [47] [Jun]
 75: 1559| [45] ["E-Ensign Jun Moribe deferring to Captain's command, sir!"]
 76: 1585| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1588| [45] ["Good!"]
 78: 1593| [45] [Watase then smiled and patted Kazami on the shoulder.]
 79: 1619| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1622| [45] ["... And there you have it. Well, that was mainly for formality's sake-- I'm still counting on you both to basically keep things running the way they've been so far."]
 81: 1627| [45] [He was probably saying that in the friendliest voice he could muster in an attempt to relieve their tension.]
 82: 1632| [45] [But Kazami was happy about that consideration.]
 83: 1637| [47] [Kazami]
 84: 1640| [45] ["Y-yes... please."]
 85: 1645| [45] [Jun then followed up as if to support Kazami's opinion.]
 86: 1671| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1674| [45] ["You're right... we can't keep staying down in the dumps forever."]
 88: 1682| [47] [Jun]
 89: 1685| [45] ["The fires are out and we've got a card, so now we can now go all the way to Area 6.%NWe have nothing to fear!"]
 90: 1711| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1714| [45] ["Yeah, that's the spirit!"]
 92: 1719| [45] [Watase gave a satisfied smile.]
 93: 1724| [45] [Kazami gently touched his shoulder--]
 94: 1729| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1732| [45] ["... Thank you so much, Captain."]
 96: 1737| [45] [And smiled back.]
 97: 1844| [45] [The group then moved on and searched Areas 5 and 6.]
 98: 1905| [45] [At one point, the factory's ceiling collapsed, trapping Watase and Yuuri under debris--]
 99: 1911| [45] [But thanks to Watase's quick decisions and his well-toned body, Yuuri was saved without a scratch.]
100: 1916| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1917| [45] [(Thank goodness... thank goodness...)]
102: 1925| [45] [Watase then discovered there was a way to open the door to the cargo lift-- the one potentially good escape route they had.]
103: 1936| [45] [Using the nearby crane, they were successful in opening the cargo lift door.]
104: 1941| [45] [They had yet to find the survivors, but still--]
105: 1947| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1948| [45] [(The six of us here can all escape in one piece, at the very least...)]
107: 1953| [45] [Kazami was grateful to Watase from the bottom of her heart for that.]
108: 2066| [47] [Watase]
109: 2069| [45] ["It really is a shame about Hiyama... but we can't afford to waste any time."]
110: 2077| [47] [Watase]
111: 2080| [45] ["The AD's effects will wear off, and we barely have any on us."]
112: 2106| [47] [Watase]
113: 2109| [45] ["This may sound harsh... but we have to survive."]
114: 2114| [47] [Kazami]
115: 2117| [45] ["But--"]
116: 2122| [45] [Though what he said was correct, he almost talked like he was blowing off the whole situation.]
117: 2127| [45] [But Watase beat Kazami to the punch before she could say anything.]
118: 2180| [47] [Watase]
119: 2183| [45] ["Didn't you hear me? Then let me make it an order-- as Sirius' captain."]
120: 2209| [47] [Watase]
121: 2212| [45] ["As of this point onwards, Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana and Ensign Jun Moribe will hereby defer to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command!"]
122: 2217| [45] [His stern declaration left no room for refusal.]
123: 2222| [45] [Kazami found herself answering instinctively in the face of that overwhelming presence.]
124: 2227| [47] [Kazami]
125: 2230| [45] ["... Roger. Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana, deferring to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command, sir."]
126: 2271| [47] [Jun]
127: 2274| [45] ["E-Ensign Jun Moribe, deferring to Captain's command, sir."]
128: 2300| [47] [Watase]
129: 2303| [45] ["Very good."]
130: 2308| [45] [Kazami couldn't read a single facet of Watase's emotion.]
131: 2313| [47] [Kazami]
132: 2314| [45] [(It's like he's barely perturbed by Hiyama's death...!)]
133: 2319| [47] [Kazami]
134: 2320| [45] [(... Is this another result of his amnesia...? Or...)]
135: 2325| [45] [An ominous sense of foreboding passed through Kazami's brain for a moment.]
136: 2330| [45] [But she shook her head and drove that delusion out.]
137: 2335| [47] [Kazami]
138: 2336| [45] [(N-no, I've got it all wrong. He's just being harsh because he's really worried about us...!)]
139: 2341| [45] [Kazami decided to believe that.]
140: 2392| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
141: 2397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2398| [45] [(It feels like she's lacking trust in Watase here...)]
143: 2403| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2404| [45] [(I need to better adjust her emotions.)]
