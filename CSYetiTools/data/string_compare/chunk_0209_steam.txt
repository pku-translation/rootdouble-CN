  0:    7| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 6]
  1:   29| [45] [--And soon enough, the taxi stopped.]
  2:   34| [45] [The kids were shocked to see what lay before them as they got down.]
  3:   80| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   83| [45] ["Here!?"]
  5:   88| [45] [It was the PRC, the same institution that they had known to be a Q target since yesterday.]
  6:   93| [45] [An explosion probably happened here. There were shards of glass everywhere. The building was wrecked.]
  7:   98| [45] [Jun's team was apparently already inside fighting fires and saving lives.]
  8:  146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  149| [45] ["So this place really was being targeted...!"]
 10:  175| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  178| [45] ["The terrorists have finally sprung into action!"]
 12:  183| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and looked around.]
 13:  188| [45] [There were onlookers gathered around the building.]
 14:  193| [45] [The crowd of course included staff members who escaped the building as well as policemen and security department people, but--]
 15:  258| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  261| [45] ["The culprit could be in the crowd...!"]
 17:  269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  272| [45] ["Yeah, the culprit always appears at the scene of the crime, they say."]
 19:  277| [45] [They weren't quite sure of the authenticity of that saying, but that was all they could rely on for now.]
 20:  282| [45] [But it was quite a difficult task to find the culprit since they had no leads.]
 21:  290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  293| [45] ["Mashiro. Can you search the crowd for the man you saw on the bus two days ago?"]
 23:  319| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  322| [45] ["Hmm~... In a crowd this big, it's obviously going to be hard. He might not be wearing the same sunglasses, after all."]
 25:  348| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  351| [45] ["... But maybe we can find him with unconventional methods?"]
 27:  359| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  362| [45] ["Hmm? Like what?"]
 29:  406| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  409| [45] ["Let's just there's more than one way to use telepathy."]
 31:  414| [45] [Mashiro gave a bold smile as she placed a finger at her temple.]
 32:  440| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  443| [45] ["The culprit hates Communicators... so let's exploit that hatred."]
 34:  451| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  454| [45] ["I'll send 'untargeted' telepathy to all the onlookers. You guys watch for anyone whose reaction looks suspicious."]
 36:  462| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  465| [45] ["G-got it!"]
 38:  491| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  494| [45] ["Roger."]
 40:  520| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  523| [45] ["I apologize for the language in advance, so don't be surprised, okay...? Well, here goes!"]
 42:  576| [45] [And with that, Mashiro closed her eyes--]
 43:  634| [85] [{Hey, you dumbass bomber! You think you got away, stupid?}]
 44:  635| [86] [Mashiro]
 45:  636| [86] [{Hey, you dumbass bomber! You think you got away, stupid?}]
 46:  654| [85] [{You hate Communicators, huh?]
 47:  656| [85] [So why the hell are you watching the fire when one's right behind you!?}]
 48:  657| [86] [Mashiro]
 49:  658| [86] [{You hate Communicators, huh? So why the hell are you watching the fire when one's right behind you!?}]
 50:  692| [45] [The head-splitting telepathy echoed inside their heads.]
 51:  697| [45] [And at the same time, all the onlookers cowered in fear.]
 52:  727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  728| [45] [(Do anyone's reactions look off!?)]
 54:  733| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu darted their eyes around the crowd.]
 55:  738| [45] [People were bewildered. People were looking around. There were various reactions, but--]
 56:  789| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  790| [45] [(!!)]
 58:  795| [45] [But just one person's reaction stood out as different--]
 59:  800| [45] [--The same time Mashiro's telepathy rang out, a man turned and looked behind his shoulder in shock.]
 60:  805| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  806| [45] [(Huh...!?)]
 62:  811| [45] [That man looked familiar to Natsuhiko.]
 63:  816| [45] [His stern face, huge body, and finally his uniform--]
 64:  866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  869| [45] ["Mashiro, Salyu, it's him!"]
 66:  874| [45] [The girls followed the path of Natsuhiko's finger and their faces stiffened.]
 67:  915| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  918| [45] ["!?"]
 69:  926| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  929| [45] ["That's...!"]
 71: 1001| [45] [--The very same security guard they ran into when they trespassed into the PRC yesterday.]
 72: 1006| [45] [The words they had heard from Ena earlier that day came to mind.]
 73: 1085| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1088| [45] ["Oftentimes they choose staff members with connections to the target buildings to be the perpetrators."]
 75: 1096| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1099| [45] ["The use of such sleeper agents increases the success rate of their terrorist acts."]
 77: 1205| [45] [A sleeper agent-- that was exactly the answer to the question that had been bugging Natsuhiko since yesterday.]
 78: 1210| [45] [The answer to why the security guard overreacted to what they said back then, too.]
 79: 1215| [45] [The answer to why he had filed a false report to the security department.]
 80: 1220| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1221| [45] [(It's because -he's- the culprit behind everything!)]
 82: 1226| [45] [The moment he made that realization, he heard the onlookers start a commotion.]
 83: 1231| [47] [Onlooker 1]
 84: 1234| [45] ["What was that telepathy just now...?"]
 85: 1239| [47] [Onlooker 2]
 86: 1242| [45] ["Yeah, she said something about a bomber..."]
 87: 1247| [45] [That's when Mashiro sent in more telepathy.]
 88: 1325| [85] [{Officers! Security department people!]
 89: 1327| [85] [The bomber's that guy who looks like a security guard!}]
 90: 1328| [86] [Mashiro]
 91: 1329| [86] [{Officers! Security department people! The bomber's that guy who looks like a security guard!}]
 92: 1344| [85] [{He's super duper dangerous,]
 93: 1346| [85] [so all you onlookers need to be careful, okay!}]
 94: 1347| [86] [Mashiro]
 95: 1348| [86] [{He's super duper dangerous, so all you onlookers need to be careful, okay!}]
 96: 1382| [45] [The commotion grew even louder.]
 97: 1387| [45] [The security guard in question became quite uncomfortable and tried to slip his way out of the crowd of onlookers.]
 98: 1395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1398| [45] ["Salyu..."]
100: 1424| [47] [Salyu]
101: 1427| [45] ["I know. It's my turn now."]
102: 1441| [45] [And with that, Salyu slipped into the crowd and chased after the security guard.]
103: 1449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1452| [45] ["Mashiro, it's dangerous, so stay back!"]
105: 1457| [45] [Natsuhiko warned Mashiro as he chased after Salyu.]
106: 1530| [45] [And once the security guard slipped out of the crowd--]
107: 1579| [47] [Salyu]
108: 1582| [45] ["Hmmph!"]
109: 1638| [45] [Salyu let out a battle cry and lunged at him, dragging him into an alley.]
110: 1715| [47] [Security Guard]
111: 1718| [45] ["Y-you brats are... gwah!"]
112: 1723| [45] [Salyu side kicked the security guard in the knee before he could finish talking.]
113: 1843| [47] [Security Guard]
114: 1846| [45] ["D-dammit!!"]
115: 1851| [45] [The security guard pulled out his extendable baton--]
116: 1869| [47] [Salyu]
117: 1872| [45] ["Shah!!"]
118: 1942| [47] [Security Guard]
119: 1945| [45] ["Kyah!!"]
120: 1950| [45] [But as soon as he got it at the ready, Salyu front kicked his wrist.]
121: 1955| [45] [The baton tumbled onto the ground. But Salyu didn't stop.]
122: 1960| [45] [Her gracefully executed roundhouse kick drew an arc through the air and into the back of his neck.]
123: 2030| [47] [Security Guard]
124: 2033| [45] ["Gh... ghh..."]
125: 2099| [45] [The security guard muttered a moan and collapsed to the ground.]
126: 2104| [47] [Security Guard]
127: 2107| [45] ["Gh, agh, aagh...!"]
128: 2112| [45] [He tried to get up. But his knee gave out and he couldn't stand.]
129: 2138| [47] [Salyu]
130: 2141| [45] ["You should stop resisting. You have no chance to succeed."]
131: 2169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2172| [45] ["Stop it, Salyu! You're going overboard!"]
133: 2177| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed up next to Salyu and tried to be the voice of reason.]
134: 2210| [45] [He stood between Salyu and the security guard and interrogated the man.]
135: 2218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2221| [45] ["... You're with Q, aren't you?"]
137: 2226| [47] [Security Guard]
138: 2229| [45] ["..."]
139: 2234| [45] [The security guard didn't answer. His facial expression merely moved ever so slightly.]
140: 2239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2240| [45] [(--There's no doubt about it. He's a terrorist!)]
142: 2245| [45] [Natsuhiko continued with conviction.]
143: 2253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2256| [45] ["Because of you, we had the security department breathing down our necks."]
145: 2264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2267| [45] ["We're gonna prove our innocence by turning you in to the security department and making you talk."]
147: 2272| [45] [The security guard's face warped.]
148: 2277| [45] [He staggered up to his feet.]
149: 2282| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2283| [45] [(There's no point trying to escape with a pitiful limp like that. The security department's swarming all over the place.)]
151: 2288| [45] [--The moment he thought that, Mashiro's voice echoed in the alley.]
152: 2321| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 2324| [45] ["Th-that's right! This is the end of your evil deeds!"]
154: 2332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2335| [45] ["!! Mashiro, I said not to come, stupid!"]
156: 2340| [45] [He turned around and shouted at Mashiro-- which created just a moment's opening.]
157: 2345| [47] [Security Guard]
158: 2348| [45] ["!!"]
159: 2353| [45] [The security guard pulled a small knife out of his pocket.]
160: 2386| [47] [Salyu]
161: 2389| [45] ["Natsuhiko, watch out!"]
162: 2394| [45] [The sound of Salyu's voice left Natsuhiko breathless.]
163: 2399| [45] [The security guard readied himself--]
164: 2404| [47] [Security Guard]
165: 2407| [45] ["Uwwooogghh!!"]
166: 2462| [45] [--and stabbed the knife into his own stomach.]
167: 2561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2564| [45] ["--... Huh?"]
169: 2569| [45] [Natsuhiko doubted his eyes.]
170: 2574| [45] [The spray of blood from the man's stomach splashed onto Salyu's face.]
171: 2582| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2585| [45] ["Ah..."]
173: 2590| [45] [Time seemed to stop for a moment.]
174: 2595| [45] [But that was of course, just an illusion--]
175: 2603| [47] [Mashiro]
176: 2606| [45] ["Kyaaaahhhh!!"]
177: 2611| [45] [Mashiro's scream snapped Natsuhiko and Salyu back to their senses.]
178: 2619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2622| [45] ["H-he stabbed... himself!?"]
180: 2630| [47] [Salyu]
181: 2633| [45] ["Why...!?"]
182: 2638| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2639| [45] [(Don't tell me he did it to avoid getting apprehended by the security department!?)]
184: 2644| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2645| [45] [(Since he succeeded in blowing up the PRC, his duty is done!? So he's basically a suicide bomber!?)]
186: 2650| [45] [Mashiro shouted to the confused Natsuhiko.]
187: 2658| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 2661| [45] ["W... we need to take him to the hospital!"]
189: 2669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2672| [45] ["Huh!? Th-this terrorist!?"]
191: 2680| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 2683| [45] ["Of course! Wh-what if he dies!?"]
193: 2688| [45] [Certainly, taking a life was not their intention in the slightest.]
194: 2693| [45] [Salyu spoke up quietly.]
195: 2701| [47] [Salyu]
196: 2704| [45] ["If he dies, then we won't be able to prove our innocence."]
197: 2712| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2715| [45] ["Th-that's right! Let's call an ambulance!"]
199: 2720| [45] [But they didn't have their PDAs on them to call 119.]
200: 2725| [45] [The kids reluctantly dashed out of the alley to look for a payphone.]
201: 2816| [45] [As they got out, they heard some onlookers talking amongst themselves.]
202: 2821| [47] [Onlooker 1]
203: 2824| [45] ["Hey, did you hear a scream?"]
204: 2829| [47] [Onlooker 2]
205: 2832| [45] ["Did it have anything to do with that telepathy earlier?"]
206: 2837| [45] [And then mixed in with those onlookers, they saw familiar people lingering around.]
207: 2842| [45] [They were the men they had been fearing ever since yesterday.]
208: 2904| [47] [Salyu]
209: 2907| [45] ["The security department...!"]
210: 2934| [47] [Mashiro]
211: 2937| [45] ["Oh no! What do we do!?"]
212: 2942| [45] [A few minutes ago, they would've run. But the situation was different now.]
213: 2950| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2953| [45] ["Ghh... it might be a long shot, but let's turn the culprit over to them!"]
215: 2979| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 2982| [45] ["Huh!?"]
217: 2990| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2993| [45] ["If we tell the security department, I'm pretty sure they'll call an ambulance for us, and besides--"]
219: 3001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3004| [45] ["If we want to clear our names, now might be our only chance."]
221: 3030| [47] [Salyu]
222: 3033| [45] ["Are you sure it won't complicate things if we showed them that crime scene!?"]
223: 3059| [47] [Mashiro]
224: 3062| [45] ["If they saw it, they'd accuse us of stabbing an upstanding citizen in retaliation for filing a report on us!"]
225: 3070| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3073| [45] ["I know it's a gamble, but we can't keep running forever, can we!?"]
227: 3081| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3084| [45] ["Besides, if we don't act quick, he'll die! No more running. No more hiding. Our best option is to talk to the security department now and get them to understand the truth!"]
229: 3110| [47] [Mashiro]
230: 3113| [45] ["Y-you're right. Okay...!"]
231: 3118| [45] [Mashiro took a deep breath and yelled.]
232: 3144| [47] [Mashiro]
233: 3147| [45] ["Security department people, over here please! The PRC bomber's over here!!"]
234: 3155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3158| [45] ["And he's attempted suicide, too! Please call an ambulance!"]
236: 3163| [47] [Security Dept.]
237: 3166| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
238: 3171| [45] [The security department members rushed over once they heard the kids' voices.]
239: 3176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3177| [45] [(We've done what we could...)]
241: 3182| [45] [As he watched the security department members rush in, Natsuhiko prayed.]
242: 3187| [45] [He prayed they made the right choice to clear their names of the false charge--]
