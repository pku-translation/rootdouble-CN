  1:   16| [45] [The team climbed down the rope at the staircase and returned to the factory on B2--]
  2:   66| [45] [--only to find the others running towards them.]
  3:  146| [47] [Jun]
  4:  149| [45] ["Captain! What happened!?"]
  5:  157| [47] [Ena]
  6:  160| [45] ["We heard this strange thump..."]
  7:  168| [47] [Watase]
  8:  171| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
  9:  199| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  202| [45] ["More importantly, did you find any survivors?"]
 11:  228| [47] [Jun]
 12:  231| [45] ["Well... no."]
 13:  309| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  312| [45] ["Captain! Did something happen!?"]
 15:  320| [47] [Ena]
 16:  323| [45] ["We heard this strange thump..."]
 17:  331| [47] [Watase]
 18:  334| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
 19:  362| [47] [Jun]
 20:  365| [45] ["Anyways, did you guys find the survivors?"]
 21:  391| [47] [Ena]
 22:  394| [45] ["Unfortunately... no."]
 23:  472| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  475| [45] ["Captain! Did something happen?"]
 25:  483| [47] [Jun]
 26:  486| [45] ["We heard this loud thump!"]
 27:  494| [47] [Watase]
 28:  497| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
 29:  525| [47] [Ena]
 30:  528| [45] ["Anyway, did you find those kids?"]
 31:  554| [47] [Jun]
 32:  557| [45] ["Well... no."]
 33:  676| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  679| [45] ["We made sure to leave no stone unturned, but we found not even a trace of the survivors."]
 35:  687| [47] [Yuuri]
 36:  690| [45] ["Um, did you find anyone in the inner ring...?"]
 37:  698| [47] [Watase]
 38:  701| [45] ["No, no one on our end either."]
 39:  706| [45] [The group had already finished exploring all the areas in LABO.]
 40:  711| [45] [But they hadn't found the survivors anywhere-- not even any bodies of them.]
 41:  719| [47] [Watase]
 42:  722| [45] ["Then... I guess there's no doubt about it."]
 43:  750| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  753| [45] ["Huh?"]
 45:  761| [47] [Watase]
 46:  764| [45] ["They already escaped through the cargo lift!"]
 47:  793| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  796| [45] ["Yes, that would make sense...!"]
 49:  801| [45] [Jun and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
 50:  827| [47] [Jun]
 51:  830| [45] ["Cargo lift? What're you talking about?"]
 52:  856| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  859| [45] ["It appears that there's a lift somewhere in the factory that we can use to escape to the surface."]
 54:  867| [47] [Watase]
 55:  870| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
 56:  875| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
 57:  901| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  904| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
 59:  930| [47] [Ena]
 60:  933| [45] ["Yeah, if we use this, we can get out of here...!"]
 61:  941| [47] [Watase]
 62:  944| [45] ["Right? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
 63:  970| [47] [Jun]
 64:  973| [45] ["No, we didn't... but maybe that's what -that- was!"]
 65: 1058| [45] [Jun turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
 66: 1063| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
 67: 1076| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1079| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
 69: 1105| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1108| [45] ["Well, it was bugging us too. I mean, it just looked so out of place. So we checked it, but..."]
 71: 1116| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1119| [45] ["... we can't get in because the security slot burned up in the fire."]
 73: 1146| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1149| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
 75: 1175| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1178| [45] ["If there really is a cargo lift, then it must be there!"]
 77: 1205| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1208| [45] ["Oh yeah, of course! That makes total sense!"]
 79: 1213| [45] [Kazami and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
 80: 1239| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1242| [45] ["Cargo lift? What do you mean?"]
 82: 1268| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1271| [45] ["It looks like there's a lift in the factory we can use to escape to the surface!"]
 84: 1279| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1282| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
 86: 1287| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
 87: 1313| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1316| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
 89: 1342| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1345| [45] ["Yes, it's possible to get out this way...!"]
 91: 1353| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1356| [45] ["Right!? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
 93: 1382| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1385| [45] ["No, we did not... but perhaps that's what -that- was."]
 95: 1470| [45] [Kazami turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
 96: 1475| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
 97: 1488| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1491| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
 99: 1517| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1520| [45] ["We found it strange as well. It didn't seem to fit with everything else, so we investigated it, but..."]
101: 1528| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1531| [45] ["We couldn't get in because the security slot was burned in the fire, so we gave up on searching it."]
103: 1558| [47] [Ena]
104: 1561| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
105: 1587| [47] [Ena]
106: 1590| [45] ["If there really is a cargo lift, then it must be there!"]
107: 1617| [47] [Ena]
108: 1620| [45] ["Yes! Th-that makes sense!"]
109: 1625| [45] [Jun and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
110: 1651| [47] [Jun]
111: 1654| [45] ["Cargo lift? What're you talking about?"]
112: 1662| [47] [Watase]
113: 1665| [45] ["It looks like there's a lift in the factory we can use to escape to the surface!"]
114: 1673| [47] [Watase]
115: 1676| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
116: 1681| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
117: 1707| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1710| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
119: 1736| [47] [Kazami]
120: 1739| [45] ["Yes, it's possible to get out this way...!"]
121: 1747| [47] [Watase]
122: 1750| [45] ["Right!? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
123: 1776| [47] [Jun]
124: 1779| [45] ["No, we didn't... but maybe that's what -that- was!"]
125: 1864| [45] [Jun turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
126: 1869| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
127: 1882| [47] [Watase]
128: 1885| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
129: 1911| [47] [Kazami]
130: 1914| [45] ["We found it strange as well. It didn't seem to fit with everything else, so we investigated it, but..."]
131: 1922| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1925| [45] ["We couldn't get in because the security slot was burned in the fire, so we gave up on searching it."]
133: 1952| [47] [Jun]
134: 1955| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
135: 1981| [47] [Jun]
136: 1984| [45] ["If there's a cargo lift, then it's gotta be there!"]
137: 2030| [47] [Watase]
138: 2033| [45] ["...!"]
139: 2039| [45] [The whole group was all smiles.]
140: 2044| [45] [They only had six AD, but if they managed to escape, then they wouldn't need them anymore.]
141: 2049| [45] [Their journey full of hardships was finally coming to an end!]
142: 2057| [47] [Watase]
143: 2060| [45] ["All right! Then let's find a way to open that gate!"]
144: 2122| [47] [Ena]
145: 2125| [45] ["Couldn't we use the air ducts to get over it like that other time?"]
146: 2152| [47] [Kazami]
147: 2155| [45] ["Unfortunately, the ceiling is too high up, so we don't have a way to get in there."]
148: 2163| [47] [Watase]
149: 2166| [45] ["Then what if we used the engine cutter to break down the gate?"]
150: 2194| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2197| [45] ["We already tried that. We went back to the makeshift base and got it."]
152: 2223| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2226| [45] ["But seeing as how the cutter failed to make even a dent in it, that gate must be quite sturdy."]
154: 2253| [47] [Jun]
155: 2256| [45] ["We already tried that. We even went back to the makeshift base just to get it."]
156: 2282| [47] [Jun]
157: 2285| [45] ["But it didn't even put a dent in that gate. We'll need something a lot stronger than that."]
158: 2293| [47] [Watase]
159: 2296| [45] ["Great, just great!"]
160: 2322| [47] [Yuuri]
161: 2325| [45] ["... How can we open it...?"]
162: 2330| [45] [Watase looked at Yuuri.]
163: 2335| [47] [Watase]
164: 2336| [45] [(Dammit, the exit's right in front of us...!)]
165: 2341| [47] [Watase]
166: 2342| [45] [(We have to get that gate open no matter what it takes... so that we can save Yuuri!)]
167: 2347| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
168: 2373| [45] [--he and everyone else suddenly heard a strange noise.]
