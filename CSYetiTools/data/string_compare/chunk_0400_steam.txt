  0:   97| [55] [√Double Chapter 6]
  1:  108| [45] [Salyu explained the details of the bomb to Natsuhiko's group.]
  2:  113| [45] [About why they couldn't disarm it, and why the lockdown timer was off.]
  3:  118| [45] [And how at this rate, everyone would die in the explosion--!]
  4:  137| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  140| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
  6:  145| [45] [The news shook up Natsuhiko's group. They all began to speak with quivering voices.]
  7:  171| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  174| [45] ["So you're saying we'll all die if we stay here!?"]
  9:  200| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  203| [45] ["Th-then we've gotta think of a way to get out of here right now!"]
 11:  229| [47] [Ena]
 12:  232| [45] ["D-don't be ridiculous... We searched the place for six hours and found nothing...!"]
 13:  255| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  256| [45] ["..."]
 15:  261| [45] [Salyu fell silent at the questioning.]
 16:  369| [45] [Ena was quite right.]
 17:  374| [45] [There was no plausible way they could conveniently find a new exit route this late in the game.]
 18:  379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  380| [45] [(... But still, we need to do something...)]
 20:  387| [45] [The time was "6:02 PM".]
 21:  392| [45] [Only 15 minutes left until the bomb went off.]
 22:  397| [45] [Yuuri spoke fearfully to Natsuhiko.]
 23:  423| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  426| [45] ["H-Hikorin... What do we do..."]
 25:  434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  437| [45] ["... At any rate, we'll all die if we stay here."]
 27:  445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  448| [45] ["Let's at least evacuate to a slightly safer place."]
 29:  474| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  477| [45] ["A safer place?"]
 31:  485| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  488| [45] ["The bomb's been planted in Area Zero."]
 33:  496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  499| [45] ["I can't predict how the explosion's blast will spread--"]
 35:  507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  510| [45] ["But if we go as far as we can from the blast radius-- in other words, right outside the emergency staircase bulkhead in Area 2-- we should be able to increase our chances of survival just a little."]
 37:  536| [47] [Ena]
 38:  539| [45] ["Do you think we'll survive if we go there...?"]
 39:  547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  550| [45] ["I don't know... but it's the best bet we've got."]
 41:  555| [45] [He couldn't think of any other options.]
 42:  581| [45] [Ena spoke to Jun in a pained voice.]
 43:  665| [47] [Ena]
 44:  668| [45] ["Ms. Moribe... Staying here means certain death. Let's go."]
 45:  691| [47] [Jun]
 46:  692| [45] ["..."]
 47:  697| [45] [Jun still hadn't moved away from Watase's and Kazami's corpses.]
 48:  702| [45] [She didn't answer Ena's call.]
 49:  728| [47] [Ena]
 50:  731| [45] ["Ms. Moribe! Help out!"]
 51:  739| [47] [Ena]
 52:  742| [45] ["I can't move two injured people by myself!"]
 53:  750| [47] [Jun]
 54:  753| [45] ["... No."]
 55:  814| [47] [Ena]
 56:  817| [45] ["...!"]
 57:  823| [45] [Ena walked briskly towards Jun,]
 58:  869| [45] [and grabbed her by the neck.]
 59:  896| [47] [Ena]
 60:  899| [45] ["What do you mean 'no'!?"]
 61:  907| [47] [Ena]
 62:  910| [45] ["You're a rescue worker, aren't you!? Are you abandoning your duty!?"]
 63:  936| [47] [Jun]
 64:  939| [45] ["What...?"]
 65:  947| [47] [Jun]
 66:  950| [45] ["I just lost two precious people. I'm the only one left on the squad now..."]
 67:  958| [47] [Jun]
 68:  961| [45] ["And you're still fussing over my 'duty'...? What the hell are you talking about?"]
 69:  987| [47] [Jun]
 70:  990| [45] ["Rescue workers are people too, you know...? Are you saying we don't deserve to mourn?"]
 71: 1016| [47] [Ena]
 72: 1019| [45] ["Cut the chatter!"]
 73: 1027| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1030| [45] ["I've lost two of my coworkers here too! But I never let that stop me, and I've gotten this far!"]
 75: 1091| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1094| [45] ["..."]
 77: 1120| [47] [Ena]
 78: 1123| [45] ["So just shut up and help! Or if you want, I can kill you right here, right now!"]
 79: 1128| [45] [Ena's voice was steeped in sadness.]
 80: 1151| [45] [After hearing all that, Jun finally nodded reluctantly...]
 81: 1273| [45] [--Ena led the group of six up to the bulkhead.]
 82: 1278| [45] [The time was "6:08 PM".]
 83: 1283| [45] [Only nine minutes left until the explosion.]
 84: 1288| [45] [They endured their fear and waited for that moment.]
 85: 1293| [45] [The mind-crushing silence was eventually shattered when Jun broke the ice.]
 86: 1319| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1322| [45] ["... Natsuhiko."]
 88: 1330| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1333| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 90: 1341| [47] [Jun]
 91: 1344| [45] ["You should've been able to erase Sis' malice with BC, right...?"]
 92: 1352| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1355| [45] ["Y... y-yes."]
 94: 1409| [47] [Jun]
 95: 1412| [45] ["... Why didn't you...?"]
 96: 1417| [45] [Jun slowly sidled up to him.]
 97: 1422| [45] [Her eyes were filled with rage.]
 98: 1448| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1451| [45] ["You just let Sis and the Captain and Mr. Ukita... all die... when you could've stopped it...?"]
100: 1459| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1462| [45] ["N-no..."]
102: 1495| [47] [Yuuri]
103: 1498| [45] ["That's not it! It was a difficult task in that situation!"]
104: 1531| [47] [Mashiro]
105: 1534| [45] ["That's right, Jun! Above all else, what Natsuhiko wanted was--"]
106: 1560| [47] [Jun]
107: 1563| [45] ["I understand that... I just wanted to know..."]
108: 1571| [47] [Jun]
109: 1574| [45] ["What Natsuhiko was intending to do..."]
110: 1582| [47] [Jun]
111: 1585| [45] ["Why he held off on using BC..."]
112: 1608| [45] [Jun got right up into Natsuhiko's face.]
113: 1613| [45] [Right as Natsuhiko's heart froze from the piercing stare--]
114: 1690| [45] [A thunderous roar suddenly rose up from beneath him.]
115: 1698| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1701| [45] ["!!"]
117: 1736| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1737| [45] [(H-here it comes!)]
119: 1742| [45] [For a second, Natsuhiko's body shook.]
120: 1825| [45] [But then, something covered him.]
121: 1875| [45] [It was Jun.]
122: 1880| [45] [Jun embraced Natsuhiko and Yuuri to cover them.]
123: 1885| [45] [In the corner of his vision, he saw Ena covering Mashiro and Salyu.]
124: 1890| [45] [The moment the six of them became a single lump--]
125: 1895| [45] [A scorching explosive blast rushed into the emergency stairwell.]
126: 2069| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 2072| [45] ["--!!"]
128: 2077| [45] [Natsuhiko desperately embraced Yuuri.]
129: 2082| [45] [An intense heat and shock enveloped his back--]
130: 2261| [45] [--]
131: 2266| [45] [----]
132: 2283| [45] [--He could hear a sound echoing from somewhere.]
133: 2291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2294| [45] ["Ugh... ughh..."]
135: 2299| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness was in a shattered world.]
136: 2304| [45] [Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch... all of his senses had been ravaged.]
137: 2309| [45] [He couldn't see anything even if he opened his eyes.]
138: 2314| [45] [But his nose filled with a burning stench--]
139: 2319| [45] [And the stench of blood.]
140: 2327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2330| [45] ["Ah... ugh, ah...!"]
142: 2335| [45] [Natsuhiko tried calling everyone's names.]
143: 2340| [45] [But his voice wouldn't come out.]
144: 2345| [45] [Only an unintelligible groan.]
145: 2350| [45] [He reluctantly mustered his strength to send telepathy.]
146: 2364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2367| [45] [{... G-guys...}]
148: 2375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 2378| [45] [{Are... you... a...live...?}]
150: 2383| [45] [He heard groans here and there as if in reply.]
151: 2391| [47] [Mashiro]
152: 2394| [45] ["A...gh..."]
153: 2402| [47] [Salyu]
154: 2405| [45] ["... Ghh..."]
155: 2413| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 2416| [45] ["... ye...ah..."]
157: 2421| [45] [There were no other responses.]
158: 2426| [45] [He didn't hear Ena or Jun.]
159: 2434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2437| [45] ["... ugh... ah..."]
161: 2442| [45] [Natsuhiko tried using his voice once again, but something else came out of his throat.]
162: 2549| [45] [A clump of blood--]
163: 2554| [45] [Something was piercing his chest.]
164: 2559| [45] [He tried to take it out, but his body wouldn't move.]
165: 2564| [45] [He could no longer move even a finger.]
166: 2580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2583| [45] [{P... Profess...sor...}]
168: 2591| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2594| [45] [{... J-Jun...}]
170: 2599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2600| [45] [{...}]
172: 2605| [45] [He could no longer even maintain the concentration to use telepathy.]
173: 2610| [45] [And at the same time--]
174: 2617| [45] [He heard the sound of people rushing towards them.]
175: 2622| [47] [???]
176: 2625| [45] ["Stay on your guard, men!"]
177: 2630| [47] [???]
178: 2633| [45] ["We don't know what happened in there! Report in as soon as you've confirmed the situation!"]
179: 2644| [45] [In his fading consciousness, Natsuhiko thought to himself.]
180: 2649| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 2650| [45] [(Security... Sector... 6...)]
182: 2655| [45] [Ominous voices echoed in his ears.]
183: 2660| [47] [???]
184: 2663| [45] ["Survivors! There's-- a few survivors here!"]
185: 2668| [47] [???]
186: 2671| [45] ["Take them into custody for now!"]
187: 2677| [45] [--That was the last thing Natsuhiko heard.]
188: 2821| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]

190: 2827| [85] [　]
