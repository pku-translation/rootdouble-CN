  1:   60| [45] [--The group headed for Area 3 as quickly as they could.]
  2:  103| [45] [One of the "security gates" that Kazami had mentioned earlier came into view when they approached the connecting passageway.]
  3:  147| [45] [Kazami pointed to a terminal next to the gate.]
  4:  194| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  197| [45] ["This is a card slot. Just swipe the right card in here and the gate will open."]
  6:  205| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  208| [45] ["You'll need a card every time you pass through a gate, even if you've already opened it once before."]
  8:  216| [47] [Watase]
  9:  219| [45] ["Okay, I'll give it a shot."]
 10:  243| [45] [He looked at Jun as he said this. She then pulled out her Procyon and stared hard at it.]
 11:  251| [47] [Watase]
 12:  254| [45] ["... What're you doing?"]
 13:  280| [47] [Jun]
 14:  283| [45] ["I need to check the radiation levels before we go into an area we haven't searched yet."]
 15:  309| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  312| [45] ["Remember, everything past this point is uncharted territory for us..."]
 17:  317| [45] [Kazami and Jun's faces were dead serious.]
 18:  322| [45] [Watase took the card out as nervousness took hold of him--]
 19:  327| [45] [And swiped it through the slot.]
 20:  403| [45] [The gate opened with a loud sound.]
 21:  408| [45] [Watase and Jun both studied their Procyons carefully.]
 22:  413| [45] [The number was... "1285 mSv". Slightly higher than the reading they'd gotten at Area 1 earlier.]
 23:  439| [47] [Jun]
 24:  442| [45] ["Okay, it's within safety standards!"]
 25:  450| [47] [Watase]
 26:  453| [45] ["What's that mean?"]
 27:  479| [47] [Jun]
 28:  482| [45] ["It means it's contaminated, but still relatively safe."]
 29:  508| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  511| [45] ["The safety standard is 'within 4000 mSv'. In other words, there's no danger of radiation contamination there so long as we've injected ourselves with AD."]
 31:  537| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  540| [45] ["The first danger standard is '4000-8000 mSv'. This refers to an area we don't want to stay in for long even with AD."]
 33:  548| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  551| [45] ["The second danger standard is 'over 8000 mSv', meaning that our lives are at great risk there even with AD."]
 35:  559| [47] [Watase]
 36:  562| [45] ["... So basically, if we have AD, we'll be okay if the reading's within 4000 mSv."]
 37:  570| [47] [Watase]
 38:  573| [45] ["If it's over 4000 mSv, then it's a bit dangerous even if we have AD..."]
 39:  581| [47] [Watase]
 40:  584| [45] ["And if it's over 8000 mSv, it's likely we'll die even with AD... did I get all that right?"]
 41:  610| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  613| [45] ["Yes. The Procyon will beep if we're in a 'contaminated zone' that exceeds the danger standard."]
 43:  639| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  642| [45] ["If you hear it beeping by any chance, then please get out of there ASAP."]
 45:  650| [47] [Watase]
 46:  653| [45] ["Y-yeah... got it."]
 47:  658| [45] [The group passed through the gate as they talked.]
 48:  750| [45] [The further they walked down the connecting passageway, the worse the damage got.]
 49:  755| [45] [The walls had been burned to hell and back, and the ceiling was damaged too.]
 50:  802| [47] [Watase]
 51:  805| [45] ["Holy crap..."]
 52:  838| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  841| [45] ["It would appear that there were explosions here too."]
 54:  884| [45] [And then, just when they'd finished rounding a corner--]
 55:  889| [45] [The whole group gasped.]
 56:  973| [47] [Watase]
 57:  976| [45] ["!?"]
 58:  981| [45] [There was a woman dangling upside-down from the ceiling.]
 59:  989| [47] [???]
 60:  992| [45] ["Mmph, mmph...!"]
 61:  997| [45] [It looked like she was sticking her lower torso into the air duct.]
 62: 1005| [47] [Kazami]
 63: 1008| [45] ["Wh-what in the world...!?"]
 64: 1016| [47] [Jun]
 65: 1019| [45] ["Well, uh, that's not something you see every day..."]
 66: 1024| [45] [As Kazami and Jun stared in utter disbelief, the woman's eyes widened with shock.]
 67: 1072| [47] [???]
 68: 1075| [45] ["Wh-who's there!?"]
 69: 1083| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1086| [45] ["Uh, we're rescue workers, ma'am..."]
 71: 1094| [47] [???]
 72: 1097| [45] ["Rescue workers!? Perfect timing!"]
 73: 1105| [47] [???]
 74: 1108| [45] ["I'm stuck! Mind pulling me out?!"]
 75: 1116| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1119| [45] ["O-okay!"]
 77: 1127| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1130| [45] ["Moribe, stand right below the air duct! Make sure she doesn't land head first!"]
 79: 1138| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1141| [45] ["Roger! Okay then, ready, set...!"]
 81: 1189| [45] [The rescue squad then frantically pulled the woman's body--]
 82: 1194| [45] [and safely rescued her.]
 83: 1273| [47] [???]
 84: 1276| [45] ["Whew... you saved me."]
 85: 1281| [45] [The woman, now standing upright on the floor, said this with a bit of embarrassment in her voice.]
 86: 1286| [45] [It seemed that she was also a survivor.]
 87: 1294| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1297| [45] ["But... what were you doing?"]
 89: 1323| [47] [???]
 90: 1326| [45] ["Me? Well, you see..."]
 91: 1331| [45] [The woman pointed to the air duct on the ceiling.]
 92: 1357| [47] [???]
 93: 1360| [45] ["The gates suddenly shut for some reason and I got stuck in this passageway... so I tried to use the air ducts to get out of here."]
 94: 1368| [47] [???]
 95: 1371| [45] ["I somehow managed to climb all the way up there by using a cable dangling from the ceiling, but..."]
 96: 1397| [47] [???]
 97: 1400| [45] ["I moved around the air duct only to nearly slide out, and, well, you know the rest."]
 98: 1427| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1430| [45] ["You went through a lot, that's for sure... but you can't get out through those air ducts."]
100: 1456| [47] [???]
101: 1459| [45] ["Really?"]
102: 1467| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1470| [45] ["Yes. I checked it myself, but there's some sort of machine set up in the ducts. There's no way to pass through the section that leads to the surface."]
104: 1496| [47] [???]
105: 1499| [45] ["Oh my, that's a shame. Well, I wasn't trying to get to the surface anyway--%Njust out of this passageway."]
106: 1575| [45] [The woman said that calmly.]
107: 1580| [47] [Watase]
108: 1581| [45] [(Don't tell me... she doesn't know what's going on right now?)]
109: 1586| [45] [With that thought weighing on his mind, Watase faced the woman and called out.]
110: 1647| [47] [Watase]
111: 1650| [45] ["Do you work for this place?"]
112: 1676| [47] [???]
113: 1679| [45] ["No, I'm a high school teacher at 'Rokumei Academy'."]
114: 1687| [47] [Watase]
115: 1690| [45] ["Rokumei Academy?"]
116: 1716| [47] [???]
117: 1719| [45] ["Huh, you've never heard of it? It's this specialty school in the city limits."]
118: 1724| [45] [Now that he thought about it, her smartly dressed attire was befitting of a teacher.]
119: 1729| [45] [But it was covered in soot, just like the rest of the group. She'd probably been through the wringer.]
120: 1755| [47] [???]
121: 1758| [45] ["So anyway, you guys are rescue workers, right? Then could you get me out of this place?"]
122: 1763| [45] [She looked at Watase with eyes full of expectation.]
123: 1768| [45] [But all he could do was answer her with a bit of guilt in his heart.]
124: 1776| [47] [Watase]
125: 1779| [45] ["About that--"]
126: 1784| [45] [The woman's face grew more and more pale the further he explained about their current predicament.]
127: 1789| [45] [It only got worse when he told her that the phones and radios were down and the elevators weren't working.]
128: 1794| [45] [But it wasn't until she heard the part about how there was no way to the surface that she finally started shouting desperately.]
129: 1820| [47] [???]
130: 1823| [45] ["No way... What do you mean, 'the bulkheads are shut'!?"]
131: 1849| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1852| [45] ["We can't figure out why it happened either...!"]
133: 1878| [47] [???]
134: 1881| [45] ["Then why don't you just destroy the damn thing with some sort of special equipment or something!?"]
135: 1909| [47] [Jun]
136: 1912| [45] ["We've tried everything we can! But not even our engine cutter could make a dent in that thing!"]
137: 1938| [47] [Kazami]
138: 1941| [45] ["We can't destroy the bulkhead with any of the equipment we have on hand."]
139: 1967| [47] [???]
140: 1970| [45] ["Hmph! I never thought a rescue squad could be this useless!"]
141: 1993| [47] [Jun]
142: 1996| [45] ["...!"]
143: 2022| [47] [Kazami]
144: 2025| [45] ["It's true that -we- can't destroy it with our equipment-- but the workers on the surface should have explosives with them."]
145: 2033| [47] [Kazami]
146: 2036| [45] ["So it's only a matter of time before that bulkhead is destroyed and reinforcements come.%NSo please try to understand for now."]
147: 2062| [47] [???]
148: 2065| [45] ["... I see, then I guess there's nothing you can do about it."]
149: 2070| [45] [The woman let out an exasperated sigh.]
150: 2096| [47] [Jun]
151: 2099| [45] ["Now wait just a minute, lady...!"]
152: 2104| [45] [Kazami held back Jun as the latter snarled angrily.]
153: 2130| [47] [Kazami]
154: 2133| [45] ["More importantly, we need to give her some AD."]
155: 2141| [47] [Watase]
156: 2144| [45] ["Oh, you're right! She'll be in big trouble without it!"]
157: 2170| [47] [???]
158: 2173| [45] ["AD? What's that?"]
159: 2181| [47] [Kazami]
160: 2184| [45] ["Well you see, it's--"]
161: 2189| [45] [Kazami explained AD to the woman.]
162: 2194| [45] [She also told her about the radiation filling the facility, the danger standards, and the Procyon.]
163: 2199| [45] [The woman's attitude took a complete 180 after she'd heard all that.]
164: 2225| [47] [???]
165: 2228| [45] ["R-radiation...!?"]
166: 2236| [47] [Kazami]
167: 2239| [45] ["That's correct. Furthermore, subjective symptoms of radiation damage easily appear in the internal organs, skin, and eyes."]
168: 2247| [47] [Kazami]
169: 2250| [45] ["Are you experiencing any nausea, skin pain, or blurry vision?"]
170: 2276| [47] [???]
171: 2279| [45] ["No, I think I'm feeling okay..."]
172: 2287| [47] [Watase]
173: 2290| [45] ["Good. Then you'll be fine as long as we give you some AD now."]
174: 2316| [47] [Jun]
175: 2319| [45] ["But you'd better do it quick, you hear? If you don't, then you won't be around to keep telling us off like that."]
176: 2345| [47] [???]
177: 2348| [45] ["O... okay. Then all I have to do is inject myself with this?"]
178: 2374| [47] [Jun]
179: 2377| [45] ["Righto, now that's better."]
180: 2382| [45] [Jun held the AD out to the woman. She proceeded to quickly inject herself with it.]
181: 2415| [47] [???]
182: 2418| [45] ["So I'll be okay now... right?"]
183: 2423| [45] [She was now a lot calmer and quieter, showing no signs of the hysterical woman that'd been yelling at them just a few minutes ago.]
184: 2428| [45] [It seemed she finally understood the situation she was in.]
185: 2436| [47] [Watase]
186: 2439| [45] ["Phew... by the way, what's your name?"]
187: 2465| [47] [Ena]
188: 2468| [45] ["... 'Ena Tsubakiyama'. And you guys?"]
189: 2473| [45] [The group promptly answered Ena's question.]
190: 2499| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2502| [45] ["I'm Lieutenant Tachibana. This is Ensign Moribe."]
192: 2510| [47] [Watase]
193: 2513| [45] ["And this girl is Yuuri, a civilian we found trapped down here."]
194: 2588| [47] [Ena]
195: 2591| [45] ["A civilian? So there's someone besides me who was caught up in this incident?"]
196: 2617| [47] [Yuuri]
197: 2620| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
198: 2625| [45] [Yuuri gave this timid answer, then followed up with a question of her own.]
199: 2651| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 2654| [45] ["Why are you here, Professor Tsubakiyama...?"]
201: 2659| [45] [Yuuri politely referred to Ena as "Professor".]
202: 2664| [45] [Ena appeared to be used to being called that, as she answered Yuuri's question without the slightest hint of awkwardness.]
203: 2690| [47] [Ena]
204: 2693| [45] ["Me? I was summoned here by one of the staff who work here."]
205: 2719| [47] [Ena]
206: 2722| [45] ["But then this explosion came out of nowhere, and next thing I know, everyone's panicking... It was so crazy that before I knew it, I was stuck here."]
207: 2730| [47] [Watase]
208: 2733| [45] ["... Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time."]
209: 2759| [47] [Ena]
210: 2762| [45] ["Hey, why're you acting like it's not your problem? You're a rescue worker, so aren't you supposed to be nicer to the people you save?"]
211: 2816| [47] [Watase]
212: 2819| [45] ["R-really?"]
213: 2824| [45] [Ena glared at Watase.]
214: 2850| [47] [Ena]
215: 2853| [45] ["... While we're at it, you're the only one whose name I haven't heard yet. Who are you?"]
216: 2861| [47] [Watase]
217: 2864| [45] ["Oh, I'm Watase Kasasagi. I'm this squad's captain... sorta."]
218: 2890| [47] [Ena]
219: 2893| [45] ["So you're the captain? You're not exactly instilling much confidence with that whole 'sorta' business."]
220: 2909| [47] [Watase]
221: 2912| [45] ["Please don't say that... Anyway, I hope we get along, Teach."]
222: 2938| [47] [Ena]
223: 2941| [45] ["Same here, Captain Kasasagi."]
224: 2946| [45] [Ena said this with a slightly sarcastic tone in her voice.]
225: 2951| [47] [Watase]
226: 2952| [45] [(But still... it must have been hard for her to be trapped in a place like this all alone.)]
227: 2957| [45] [Kazami's words mirrored the thoughts passing through Watase's mind.]
228: 2969| [47] [Watase]
229: 2972| [45] ["Please don't be so harsh. I get that you're not happy about being stuck in this situation, but still..."]
230: 2998| [47] [Ena]
231: 3001| [45] ["See, there you go again, acting like this isn't your problem."]
232: 3006| [45] [Watase winced and shut his mouth as Ena nagged him again.]
233: 3011| [47] [Watase]
234: 3012| [45] [(But still... isn't it a bit odd for a high school teacher to be in a place like this?)]
235: 3017| [45] [Watase quietly stared at Ena's face.]
236: 3043| [47] [Ena]
237: 3046| [45] ["What is it, Captain Kasasagi? Have I got something on my face?"]
238: 3054| [47] [Watase]
239: 3057| [45] ["Oh, no, nothing like that, really..."]
240: 3062| [45] [Kazami spoke up as Watase awkwardly tried to cover up for himself.]
241: 3191| [47] [Kazami]
242: 3194| [45] ["Now then, let's press onwards. There might be other survivors."]
243: 3199| [45] [The group started walking again at that suggestion.]
244: 3243| [45] [There was a security gate at the end of the passageway, but a swipe of the security card quickly took care of it.]
245: 3400| [45] [And with that, the group of five entered Area 3.]
