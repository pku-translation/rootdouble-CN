  1:   56| [45] [--Lunch break ended, and thus, the first afternoon class began--]
  2:  122| [45] [It was a special lecture from a visiting guest.]
  3:  127| [45] [Not that guest lectures were all that rare.]
  4:  132| [45] [Rokumei Academy actively contacted outside research institutions and enterprises for industry-academic cooperation.]
  5:  137| [45] [And the guest lecturer of the day was someone Natsuhiko knew very well.]
  6:  207| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  210| [45] ["Good afternoon. I am a researcher at the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization. Keiji Ukita is my name."]
  8:  215| [45] [Indeed, Ukita was a staff member at LABO, just like Natsuhiko's mother.%NHe was the guest lecturer today.]
  9:  220| [45] [Ukita seemed a little awkward and unaccustomed to giving lectures, but appeared to be in good health at least.]
 10:  225| [45] [Mashiro whispered gently into Natsuhiko's ear from the next seat.]
 11:  331| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  334| [45] ["Hey, I guess Mr. Ukita's injuries from that accident weren't all that bad, huh..."]
 13:  342| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  345| [45] ["Seems like it. That's a relief..."]
 15:  350| [45] [That said, it was quite unfortunate that he had to fulfill an extra work duty like this right after an accident.]
 16:  355| [45] [Ukita himself seemed a little uneasy about Natsuhiko and Mashiro's glances, as he began to strain himself to speak.]
 17:  493| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  496| [45] ["Uh, umm... Let's see, well, today I'm here to talk to you kids about nuclear power."]
 19:  522| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  525| [45] ["This is important information that everyone living in this city should know."]
 21:  530| [45] [Nuclear power-- the topic was even part of Rokumei Academy's peculiar curriculum.]
 22:  535| [45] [But Natsuhiko was as bad at this subject as he was with BC.]
 23:  540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  541| [45] [(It's not like I can learn to like it...)]
 25:  546| [45] [But Ukita came all the way out here for a guest lecture.]
 26:  551| [45] [So Natsuhiko thought that he might as well try to listen seriously for once today.]
 27:  577| [47] [Ukita]
 28:  580| [45] ["When studying nuclear energy, one thing that one must first learn is the dreadfulness of radioactivity."]
 29:  588| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  591| [45] ["It may have happened nearly half a century ago, but you all have probably heard of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster in Ukraine."]
 31:  618| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  621| [45] ["It's still known today as the greatest man-made disaster in recorded history."]
 33:  626| [45] [Ukita spoke in a bitter voice.]
 34:  652| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  655| [45] ["Essentially what happened in that incident is that the power plant's nuclear reactor melted down..."]
 36:  663| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  666| [45] ["Basically, the reactor core suffered a meltdown and subsequently exploded, spreading as much as 10 tons of radioactive material all over the place."]
 38:  674| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  677| [45] ["It was the equivalent of 500 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima, causing enormous casualties."]
 40:  703| [47] [Ukita]
 41:  706| [45] ["The residents in the vicinity and the firefighters sent in to handle the accident were hit the hardest; over 3000 of them died. And the number only rose after that."]
 42:  732| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  735| [45] ["Even to this day we don't know exactly how many died-- but the number is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands."]
 44:  740| [45] [Ukita's voice gradually intensified, filling the classroom with tension.]
 45:  766| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  769| [45] ["... The reason there were so many deaths is definitely linked to the radioactive material."]
 47:  777| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  780| [45] ["From the explosions and fires came what we call 'atomic dust', which proceeded to float up into the sky, then fall back down to the earth with rain."]
 49:  788| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  791| [45] ["And this is the truly terrifying part. It was not limited to just an ordinary explosion: the devastating effects spread out to the surrounding regions."]
 51:  799| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  802| [45] ["The people soaked in the tainted rain developed severe, fatal symptoms: neurological disorders, brain dysfunctions, genetic abnormalities, and... cancer."]
 53:  807| [45] [Natsuhiko gulped as Ukita continued.]
 54:  833| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  836| [45] ["With its own nuclear power plant, the city was once a luxuriously wealthy metropolis--"]
 56:  862| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  865| [45] ["But overnight, that very power plant made the city an inhospitable wasteland;%Nall 120,000 residents were forced to evacuate."]
 58:  892| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  895| [45] ["The effects of the pollution continue to this day, and it is said that the area will remain unsafe for another 900 years."]
 60:  900| [45] [As Ukita continued, a solemn silence spread throughout the classroom.]
 61:  926| [47] [Ukita]
 62:  929| [45] ["... With that out of the way, we at LABO also have a nuclear reactor for research purposes."]
 63:  956| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  959| [45] ["In the off chance that there is a meltdown and the radioactive material spreads, there's a possibility that the very same thing could happen to this town...!"]
 65:  964| [47] [All]
 66:  967| [45] ["!!"]
 67:  972| [45] [Those words sparked tension in the room.]
 68:  977| [45] [But Ukita soon continued.]
 69: 1003| [47] [Ukita]
 70: 1006| [45] ["... Or at least that's what a lot of people fear. But that will definitely never happen!"]
 71: 1032| [47] [Ukita]
 72: 1035| [45] ["First of all, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had an extremely careless management structure which is what allowed the accident to even happen."]
 73: 1043| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1046| [45] ["But LABO has layer upon layer of perfected systems to counter any unforeseen circumstance."]
 75: 1080| [45] [And with that, Ukita fiddled with the PC at hand.]
 76: 1211| [45] [Upon which, the screen displayed an image of LABO.]
 77: 1229| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1232| [45] ["We at LABO have a perfected system to deal with every sort of disaster imaginable."]
 79: 1304| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1307| [45] ["The nuclear reactor's surveillance and control is continually managed by a supercomputer, protecting it from any accident or malfunction--"]
 81: 1316| [47] [Ukita]
 82: 1319| [45] ["And in the unlikely event of that supercomputer failing, emergency shutdown of the nuclear reactor is possible from the remote control room on the surface floor."]
 83: 1391| [47] [Ukita]
 84: 1394| [45] ["Furthermore, three nuclear reactor control systems with sixfold reserve energy guarantee emergency support."]
 85: 1402| [47] [Ukita]
 86: 1405| [45] ["In addition to the firefighting and disaster prevention systems, we also have flawless defense systems to prevent intrusion."]
 87: 1413| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1416| [45] ["The nuclear reactor itself is underground, and the area where it's contained is made to be particularly rugged."]
 89: 1540| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1543| [45] ["The reactor area could be hit by an explosion, an earthquake, or an airplane crash and still not break."]
 91: 1569| [47] [Ukita]
 92: 1572| [45] ["In other words, a repeat of the Chernobyl Disaster will never.... EVER happen again!"]
 93: 1598| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1601| [45] ["So please, rest assured, kids. We at LABO will not cause any sort of accident, okay?"]
 95: 1606| [45] [Ukita looked around the classroom as he spoke.]
 96: 1611| [45] [An air of relief filled the class.]
 97: 1616| [45] [Upon which, Mashiro timidly raised a question.]
 98: 1723| [47] [Mashiro]
 99: 1726| [45] ["Umm, Mr.... Prof. Ukita?"]
100: 1734| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1737| [45] ["What if an accident still manages to happen?"]
102: 1833| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1836| [45] ["May I take that to mean when an accident does happen, how do we handle it?"]
104: 1932| [47] [Mashiro]
105: 1935| [45] ["Yes... I've heard that large-scale accidents have happened in the past even here in this country..."]
106: 2031| [47] [Ukita]
107: 2034| [45] ["... I see. Allow me to explain, then."]
108: 2095| [45] [Ukita used the PC to display a different image on the screen.]
109: 2202| [47] [Ukita]
110: 2205| [45] ["First of all, modern facility construction technology and safety standards have advanced considerably compared to the past."]
111: 2213| [47] [Ukita]
112: 2216| [45] ["LABO's interior walls and floors are, of course, designed to block out the leakage of radioactive material by nature, but--"]
113: 2288| [47] [Ukita]
114: 2291| [45] ["In the unlikely event a leak occurs, the automatic radiation leakage prevention system activates."]
115: 2363| [47] [Ukita]
116: 2366| [45] ["Several 'bulkheads' and 'gates' are installed that lock down to completely shut out the scattering of radioactive material."]
117: 2438| [47] [Ukita]
118: 2441| [45] ["Furthermore, the automatic reporting system tips the local fire station posthaste..."]
119: 2449| [47] [Ukita]
120: 2452| [45] ["Allowing for the immediate dispatch of firefighters and a rescue squad to contain the accident and save lives."]
121: 2521| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 2524| [45] ["A rescue squad...!"]
123: 2529| [45] [Mashiro's expression stiffened. She was probably thinking of Jun.]
124: 2555| [47] [Mashiro]
125: 2558| [45] ["B-but would they be okay? Lots of firefighters passed away in Chernobyl, didn't they?"]
126: 2654| [47] [Ukita]
127: 2657| [45] ["You see, in those days, they lacked sufficient knowledge and equipment to properly deal with nuclear accidents... but the situation's different now."]
128: 2683| [47] [Ukita]
129: 2686| [45] ["Our city's rescue squad is trained to handle NBC disasters, after all."]
130: 2782| [47] [Mashiro]
131: 2785| [45] ["What are NBC disasters?"]
132: 2881| [47] [Ukita]
133: 2884| [45] ["NBC stands for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical."]
134: 2892| [47] [Ukita]
135: 2895| [45] ["So it's a general term for disasters dealing with dangerous radioactivity, microbes, and/or chemical substances."]
136: 2903| [47] [Ukita]
137: 2906| [45] ["If we at LABO were to experience a disaster, it'd be an 'N' disaster. That is, a nuclear disaster."]
138: 2932| [47] [Ukita]
139: 2935| [45] ["Our rescue squad is equipped with 'protection suits' that defend against strong radiation when they deploy."]
140: 2943| [47] [Ukita]
141: 2946| [45] ["Also, if those in the facility become in danger of radiation exposure, we also have a drug that can can neutralize radioactive material and expel it from the body..."]
142: 2954| [47] [Ukita]
143: 2957| [45] ["These items are the fruit of LABO's research and development and are extremely effective at lifesaving."]
144: 2962| [45] [Ukita continued with a considerable force behind his voice.]
145: 2988| [47] [Ukita]
146: 2991| [45] ["However, all of these things are available for us as 'insurance', nothing more!"]
147: 2999| [47] [Ukita]
148: 3002| [45] ["We at LABO have learned from the mistakes of nuclear disasters like Chernobyl, and rather than 'handling accidents that occur'--"]
149: 3010| [47] [Ukita]
150: 3013| [45] ["We concentrate our efforts more heavily on 'preventing accidents from ever occurring'."]
151: 3039| [47] [Ukita]
152: 3042| [45] ["All of those 'insurances' I've explained will most likely never need to be used. For all eternity."]
153: 3138| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 3141| [45] ["S-so everything will be fine...?"]
155: 3146| [45] [After hearing all of that explanation, an expression of relief rose up on Mashiro's face.]
156: 3172| [47] [Mashiro]
157: 3175| [45] ["Um, sorry for asking a weird question."]
158: 3271| [47] [Ukita]
159: 3274| [45] ["Not at all. If it helped eliminate any uneasiness you had, that's all that matters."]
160: 3279| [45] [Ukita himself sighed seemingly in relief before he continued.]
161: 3305| [47] [Ukita]
162: 3308| [45] ["Anyway, with those systems as our insurance, we at LABO conduct various forms of research using our nuclear reactor."]
163: 3380| [47] [Ukita]
164: 3383| [45] ["For example, one subject of research we began in recent years..."]
165: 3388| [45] [Ukita began talking about research conducted at LABO.]
166: 3393| [45] [But Natsuhiko was completely inattentive. He couldn't get his mind off the "safety measures" Ukita had talked about.]
167: 3398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 3399| [45] [(... They better have improved their safety measures.)]
169: 3404| [45] [That's the thought that came to mind.]
170: 3515| [45] [And then he suddenly thought about Yuuri, who was waiting at home.]
171: 3520| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 3521| [45] [(... Never again should that happen...)]
173: 3526| [45] [Whenever he thought about LABO, he would worry about Yuuri.]
174: 3531| [45] [It was something of a conditioned reflex that had sunk deeply into his mind for years and years.]
175: 3593| [45] [And then he caught sight of Mashiro from the side.]
176: 3686| [47] [Mashiro]
177: 3687| [45] ["..."]
178: 3692| [45] [Mashiro was looking at the teacher's desk with a somehow languorous look in her face.]
179: 3697| [45] [Natsuhiko could tell she was uneasy.]
180: 3702| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 3703| [45] [(Mashiro's probably thinking the same thing I am...)]
182: 3800| [45] [And then he caught sight of Salyu from the side.]
183: 3805| [45] [She looked as expressionless as ever. As if she didn't have any impression in particular.]
184: 3810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 3811| [45] [(I guess the whole thing just doesn't feel real to Salyu yet.)]
186: 3816| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 3817| [45] [(Not everybody lives in a city with a nuclear reactor after all...)]
188: 3822| [45] [But perhaps it was a good thing for it to not feel real.]
189: 3830| [45] [And then he recalled what Jun had said.]
190: 3907| [47] [Jun]
191: 3910| [45] ["Welp, don't hesitate to call if something happens. Later~"]
192: 3978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 3979| [45] [(In the unlikely event an accident occurs, Jun will have to dispatch, huh...)]
194: 3984| [45] [He hoped from the bottom of his heart that it would never come to that.]
195: 4063| [45] [Natsuhiko looked to the sky outside the window.]
196: 4068| [45] [The sky had been clear just awhile ago, but dark clouds had covered it before he had noticed.]
197: 4073| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 4074| [45] [(... That's a little depressing.)]
199: 4079| [45] [Natsuhiko shook off that feeling and refocused on Ukita's lecture.]
200: 4129| [45] [--Eventually, the two hours of the special lecture, including a break, came to a smooth close--]
201: 4218| [47] [Ukita]
202: 4221| [45] ["That's all I have for the lecture. Thank you for paying attention, students."]
203: 4326| [45] [And with that, Ukita left the classroom.]
204: 4331| [45] [As Natsuhiko stretched out wide, Mashiro spoke up.]
205: 4357| [47] [Mashiro]
206: 4360| [45] ["Hey, Natsuhiko, let's go greet Mr. Ukita."]
207: 4368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 4371| [45] ["Hmm? Ah... right."]
209: 4376| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Natsuhiko did remember something he wanted to ask Ukita.]
210: 4384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 4387| [45] ["Okay. Sit tight for a second, Salyu."]
212: 4456| [47] [Salyu]
213: 4459| [45] ["Mm."]
214: 4464| [45] [Mashiro and Natsuhiko left Salyu in the classroom as they followed Ukita out.]
215: 4599| [45] [When they got out into the hallway, they caught sight of him walking away.]
216: 4607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 4610| [45] ["Good job, Prof. Ukita."]
218: 4636| [47] [Ukita]
219: 4639| [45] ["Hmm? Oh, Natsuhiko. Mashiro. Anything I can help you with?"]
220: 4665| [47] [Ukita]
221: 4668| [45] ["If you have complaints about the lecture, please forgive me. It's not something I'm particularly accustomed to."]
222: 4737| [47] [Mashiro]
223: 4740| [45] ["No, it's not like that at all."]
224: 4766| [47] [Mashiro]
225: 4769| [45] ["We were just worried if you were okay after that accident. You said your rib cage hurt, after all."]
226: 4795| [47] [Ukita]
227: 4798| [45] ["Thanks for your concern. However, they took an X-ray at the hospital and everything looked okay."]
228: 4824| [47] [Ukita]
229: 4827| [45] ["I'm actually almost grateful since I was able to use the accident as an excuse to take two days off from work."]
230: 4853| [47] [Mashiro]
231: 4856| [45] ["Thank goodness~ I was so worried."]
232: 4861| [45] [Natsuhiko cut in as Mashiro sighed in relief.]
233: 4870| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 4873| [45] ["By the way, Mr. Ukita..."]
235: 4905| [47] [Ukita]
236: 4908| [45] ["What is it?"]
237: 4916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 4919| [45] ["After the accident, you said that strange things might start happening to me, didn't you?"]
239: 4924| [45] [Ukita's expression stiffened at those words.]
240: 4950| [47] [Mashiro]
241: 4953| [45] ["Now that you mention it..."]
242: 4979| [47] [Ukita]
243: 4982| [45] ["Yeah... I did indeed say that, didn't I?"]
244: 4990| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 4993| [45] ["What did you mean by that?"]
246: 5019| [47] [Ukita]
247: 5022| [45] ["Yes, well..."]
248: 5027| [45] [After a short pause, Ukita spoke in a subdued voice.]
249: 5053| [47] [Ukita]
250: 5056| [45] ["... Well, actually, this is nothing more than hearsay, but..."]
251: 5064| [47] [Ukita]
252: 5067| [45] ["There's apparently been an increase in those that harbor anti-Communicator sentiments in town lately."]
253: 5093| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 5096| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
255: 5122| [47] [Mashiro]
256: 5125| [45] ["No way! But Rokumei City's supposed to encourage BC research..."]
257: 5151| [47] [Ukita]
258: 5154| [45] ["It's not as if everybody shares that sentiment, though."]
259: 5180| [47] [Ukita]
260: 5183| [45] ["Natsuhiko used such powerful mass untargeted telepathy in the middle of town."]
261: 5191| [47] [Ukita]
262: 5194| [45] ["According to a friend of mine, they could apparently hear that 'Get away from there!' from as far as a kilometer away."]
263: 5202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 5205| [45] ["A kilometer!?"]
265: 5231| [47] [Ukita]
266: 5234| [45] ["Indeed. I was worried that if some of those BC-haters heard that telepathy... they might harm you."]
267: 5242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 5245| [45] ["So that's what it was..."]
269: 5250| [45] [Natsuhiko shuddered a bit at the unexpected answer.]
270: 5255| [45] [Outside of the school, use of BC was prohibited by city ordinance.]
271: 5260| [45] [They were taught that the reasoning behind the ordinance was for manners, so that they wouldn't surprise other people--]
272: 5265| [45] [But perhaps the real reason was so as to not provoke the townspeople.]
273: 5291| [47] [Mashiro]
274: 5294| [45] ["Oh no... a few days ago, I used telepathy to stop a bus too...!"]
275: 5302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 5305| [45] ["Now that you mention it, that was mass untargeted telepathy, too..."]
277: 5331| [47] [Ukita]
278: 5334| [45] ["Ah, no, calm down, you two. It's only dangerous in the case of 'powerful' telepathy."]
279: 5342| [47] [Ukita]
280: 5345| [45] ["Normal telepathy from normal Communicators shouldn't be that much of an issue."]
281: 5371| [47] [Ukita]
282: 5374| [45] ["It's not that much more of a nuisance than shouting really loudly, after all."]
283: 5400| [47] [Mashiro]
284: 5403| [45] ["I see... thank goodness."]
285: 5429| [47] [Ukita]
286: 5432| [45] ["That said, it still wouldn't hurt to be careful. Especially you, Natsuhiko."]
287: 5458| [47] [Ukita]
288: 5461| [45] ["So, Natsuhiko? You haven't been recklessly using telepathy after that, have you?"]
289: 5469| [47] [Natsuhiko]
290: 5472| [45] ["Ah, no... actually, I haven't even been able to use it once ever since. That one time was more like a fluke than anything."]
291: 5498| [47] [Ukita]
292: 5501| [45] ["I see. Maybe there's no need to worry, then."]
293: 5506| [45] [Ukita's expression relaxed and he continued.]
294: 5533| [47] [Ukita]
295: 5536| [45] ["Well, I think it might just be me needlessly worrying, but still, keep it in mind."]
296: 5568| [47] [Ukita]
297: 5571| [45] ["Now then, I'll be heading back to LABO. I've still got some of my real work to do."]
298: 5579| [47] [Natsuhiko]
299: 5582| [45] ["O-okay. Thank you."]
300: 5654| [47] [Mashiro]
301: 5657| [45] ["Good job with the lecture."]
302: 5717| [45] [Ukita waved his hand at Natsuhiko and Mashiro's farewells as he left the hallway.]
303: 5725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 5728| [45] ["... Now that was kind of ominous."]
305: 5782| [47] [Mashiro]
306: 5785| [45] ["Yeah. It's amazing how that telepathy of yours reached as far as one kilometer, though..."]
307: 5801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 5804| [45] ["At any rate, it'd be best to hold back on untargeted telepathy use."]
309: 5830| [47] [Mashiro]
310: 5833| [45] ["... True. I've been a little careless myself."]
311: 5838| [45] [Mashiro sounded a little bit frightened as she spoke.]
312: 5846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
313: 5849| [45] ["... You worried, Mashiro?"]
314: 5875| [47] [Mashiro]
315: 5878| [45] ["Huh?"]
316: 5886| [47] [Natsuhiko]
317: 5889| [45] ["It'll be fine. Mr. Ukita said so himself, right?"]
318: 5897| [47] [Natsuhiko]
319: 5900| [45] ["I mean, he said that normal telepathy isn't that much different from yelling really loud."]
320: 5926| [47] [Mashiro]
321: 5929| [45] ["Y-yeah, I know."]
322: 5955| [47] [Mashiro]
323: 5958| [45] ["... Why do you ask? Did I look that uneasy?"]
324: 5966| [47] [Natsuhiko]
325: 5969| [45] ["A little."]
326: 5995| [47] [Mashiro]
327: 5998| [45] ["What, don't tell me you were worried about little ol' me?"]
328: 6006| [47] [Natsuhiko]
329: 6009| [45] ["I guess."]
330: 6035| [47] [Mashiro]
331: 6038| [45] ["Th-that was a little blunt... You're kinda throwing me off here."]
332: 6046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
333: 6049| [45] ["What's wrong with me worrying about you?"]
334: 6054| [45] [Mashiro suddenly smiled as she heard that.]
335: 6080| [47] [Mashiro]
336: 6083| [45] ["Natsuhiko, that has to be just about the only part about you that--"]
337: 6091| [45] [Right as Mashiro started to speak, she heard a voice from behind.]
338: 6099| [47] [Ena]
339: 6102| [45] ["Hey, you two, what do you think you're doing out here? Afternoon homeroom's about to start."]
340: 6242| [45] [She turned around to see Ena.]
341: 6250| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 6253| [45] ["Ah, okay."]
343: 6258| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro rushed back into the classroom.]
