  0:   92| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
  1:   96| [45] [--But everything was stable for the time being.]
  2:  101| [45] [Now the group had to pull themselves together and continue with the search whether they liked it or not.]
  3:  106| [45] [Watase addressed the others with that thought in mind.]
  4:  120| [47] [Watase]
  5:  123| [45] ["Okay then... it looks like all of us except for Tachibana are here, then."]
  6:  134| [47] [Watase]
  7:  137| [45] ["Our team got here by circling around from Area 5."]
  8:  145| [47] [Watase]
  9:  148| [45] ["Moribe, did your team find anything?"]
 10:  174| [47] [Jun]
 11:  177| [45] ["No... no sign of Yuuri or anyone else, and no AD either."]
 12:  203| [47] [Ena]
 13:  206| [45] ["Yeah, the same goes for an escape route too."]
 14:  214| [47] [Watase]
 15:  217| [45] ["What about you, old man?"]
 16:  243| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  246| [45] ["It's only been 20 minutes since I split up from you guys, hasn't it?%NOf course I didn't find anything."]
 18:  255| [47] [Watase]
 19:  258| [45] ["Our team got here from circling around from Area 6."]
 20:  266| [47] [Watase]
 21:  269| [45] ["Teach, your team find anything?"]
 22:  295| [47] [Ena]
 23:  298| [45] ["No... we couldn't locate Ms. Yuuri or the others, and we didn't see any AD either."]
 24:  306| [47] [Watase]
 25:  309| [45] ["What about you, old man?"]
 26:  335| [47] [Ukita]
 27:  338| [45] ["It's only been 20 minutes since I split up from you guys, hasn't it?%NOf course I didn't find anything."]
 28:  365| [47] [Watase]
 29:  368| [45] ["Our team got here from circling around from Area 6."]
 30:  376| [47] [Watase]
 31:  379| [45] ["Moribe, did your team find anything?"]
 32:  405| [47] [Jun]
 33:  408| [45] ["No... no sign of Yuuri or anyone else, and no AD either."]
 34:  446| [45] [Like always, their search had yielded nothing.]
 35:  454| [47] [Watase]
 36:  457| [45] ["I see... then did any of you notice anything strange?"]
 37:  462| [45] [Watase said that as a way to basically say "did anyone spot Salyu"--]
 38:  467| [45] [But then Jun gave a surprising answer.]
 39:  493| [47] [Jun]
 40:  496| [45] ["Ah, now that you mention it, I did. It's nothing major, but--"]
 41:  504| [47] [Jun]
 42:  507| [45] ["That 'floral scent' has suddenly disappeared for some reason."]
 43:  515| [47] [Watase]
 44:  518| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 45:  523| [45] [Watase was totally confused by her comment.]
 46:  531| [47] [Watase]
 47:  534| [45] ["What 'floral scent'?"]
 48:  560| [47] [Jun]
 49:  563| [45] ["Well, you know, it's been hanging around here and there in the facility.%NYou didn't smell it?"]
 50:  571| [47] [Watase]
 51:  574| [45] ["Wait, was there something like that?"]
 52:  579| [45] [Watase then glanced at Ukita and Ena.]
 53:  605| [47] [Ukita]
 54:  608| [45] ["Ah, now that you mention it, I do recall smelling that."]
 55:  634| [47] [Ena]
 56:  637| [45] ["Huh? Hmm... I don't think I ever did."]
 57:  642| [45] [Two contradicting statements.]
 58:  650| [47] [Watase]
 59:  653| [45] ["...?"]
 60:  658| [45] [It just didn't make sense to Watase.]
 61:  663| [45] [The four of them, plus Kazami and Yuuri, had traveled through the entire facility together, yet Watase and Ena didn't smell anything while Jun and Ukita did.]
 62:  671| [47] [Watase]
 63:  674| [45] ["What are you talking about...? Where did you smell that?"]
 64:  700| [47] [Jun]
 65:  703| [45] ["No, seriously, it's not a big deal, so forget about it."]
 66:  711| [47] [Jun]
 67:  714| [45] ["Anyway, what about you guys? You notice anything?"]
 68:  722| [47] [Watase]
 69:  725| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
 70:  730| [45] [Watase said that and changed his train of thought.]
 71:  738| [47] [Watase]
 72:  741| [45] ["Actually, Teach and I spotted Salyu earlier... but she ran off again."]
 73:  767| [47] [Jun]
 74:  770| [45] ["Again? Why?"]
 75:  778| [47] [Watase]
 76:  781| [45] ["... I don't know."]
 77:  786| [45] [Salyu's words crossed his mind for a moment.]
 78:  791| [45] ["Be careful of that captain. He's a dangerous man."]
 79:  796| [45] [But Ena didn't bring that up, perhaps out of consideration for Watase.]
 80:  822| [47] [Ena]
 81:  825| [45] ["I don't know why she ran off, but she still looked lively from what I could see."]
 82:  833| [47] [Ena]
 83:  836| [45] ["I think she's been regularly giving herself AD."]
 84:  862| [47] [Jun]
 85:  865| [45] ["Yeah, that's a silver lining, that's for sure...!"]
 86:  891| [47] [Ukita]
 87:  894| [45] ["Indeed... that was the one thing I was worried about."]
 88:  899| [45] [Everyone nodded at Ukita's comment.]
 89:  907| [47] [Watase]
 90:  910| [45] ["Though that said, that doesn't necessarily mean she has enough AD."]
 91:  918| [47] [Watase]
 92:  921| [45] ["She probably ran off in the direction of Area 6. Let's look for her together."]
 93:  950| [47] [Jun]
 94:  953| [45] ["What should we do about the Lieutenant?"]
 95:  961| [47] [Watase]
 96:  964| [45] ["I told her to return to the neuroscience laboratory once she'd healed up."]
 97:  990| [47] [Jun]
 98:  993| [45] ["Then this is a good opportunity, seeing as how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience lab."]
 99: 1053| [47] [Jun]
100: 1056| [45] ["What should we do about the Lieutenant?"]
101: 1082| [47] [Ena]
102: 1085| [45] ["She said she'd head back to the neuroscience laboratory once she got better."]
103: 1093| [47] [Watase]
104: 1096| [45] ["Then that's perfect, seeing how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience laboratory and all."]
105: 1141| [47] [Ena]
106: 1144| [45] ["What should we do about Ms. Tachibana?"]
107: 1152| [47] [Jun]
108: 1155| [45] ["She said she'd be going back to the neuroscience laboratory once she felt better again."]
109: 1163| [47] [Watase]
110: 1166| [45] ["Then that's perfect, seeing how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience laboratory and all."]
111: 1192| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1195| [45] ["Then let's continue the search, shall we?"]
113: 1203| [47] [Ena]
114: 1206| [45] ["Yes. Let's get going."]
115: 1211| [45] [The group then started to walk off.]
116: 1319| [45] [Ena was walking in front of the others.]
117: 1324| [45] [She was fiddling around with her PDA, probably to check her map.]
118: 1329| [45] [Watase walked up to her and whispered into her ear.]
119: 1337| [47] [Watase]
120: 1340| [45] ["Teach."]
121: 1453| [47] [Ena]
122: 1456| [45] ["!!"]
123: 1461| [45] [Ena turned around in surprise.]
124: 1466| [45] [She put away her PDA and spoke in a sharp voice.]
125: 1492| [47] [Ena]
126: 1495| [45] ["Don't sneak up on me like that. You scared the living daylights out of me."]
127: 1515| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
128: 1526| [47] [Watase]
129: 1529| [45] ["O-oh, sorry...."]
130: 1537| [47] [Watase]
131: 1540| [45] ["But anyway, I couldn't help but notice you didn't tell Moribe or the old man about what Salyu said."]
132: 1566| [47] [Ena]
133: 1569| [45] ["You fool, of course I didn't. It would just make things unnecessarily complicated."]
134: 1577| [47] [Ena]
135: 1580| [45] ["That's the same reason I didn't tell them about the bomb."]
136: 1588| [47] [Ena]
137: 1591| [45] ["After all, it seems it was my pistol that made everyone so furious."]
138: 1599| [47] [Watase]
139: 1602| [45] ["I see..."]
140: 1628| [47] [Ena]
141: 1631| [45] ["But you know--"]
142: 1639| [47] [Ena]
143: 1642| [45] ["We need to constantly keep that bomb incident and what happened with Ms. Sannomiya in mind."]
144: 1650| [47] [Watase]
145: 1653| [45] ["Huh?"]
146: 1679| [47] [Ena]
147: 1682| [45] ["There must be a reason behind Ms. Sannomiya running away from us that we don't know about."]
148: 1690| [47] [Ena]
149: 1693| [45] ["Someone had to have planted that bomb. That's for sure."]
150: 1701| [47] [Ena]
151: 1704| [45] ["We might overlook something vital if we lower our guards. Something that may cost us our lives."]
152: 1712| [47] [Watase]
153: 1715| [45] ["..."]
154: 1766| [45] [Ena was speaking with a type of intensity that she'd never used before.]
155: 1771| [45] [A silent edge different from all her backtalk and hysteric shouting could be felt from her.]
156: 1779| [47] [Watase]
157: 1782| [45] ["Teach, what are you...?"]
158: 1808| [47] [Ena]
159: 1811| [45] ["I'm telling you to doubt everything around you."]
160: 1819| [47] [Ena]
161: 1822| [45] ["That includes the people nearby, this facility, and occasionally everything you see.%NYour own preconceptions may be tricking you, after all."]
162: 1838| [47] [Watase]
163: 1841| [45] ["... O-okay... I'll keep that in mind."]
164: 1867| [47] [Ena]
165: 1870| [45] ["Now that's a good boy. That's what I like to see in a student."]
166: 1878| [47] [Watase]
167: 1881| [45] ["I'm not your student, you know..."]
168: 1889| [47] [Ena]
169: 1892| [45] ["But since you don't have any memories, that means I must have more life experience than you do for now."]
170: 1900| [47] [Ena]
171: 1903| [45] ["Maybe this will make me sound arrogant, but just interpret it as your elder's opinion in that case."]
172: 1932| [47] [Watase]
173: 1935| [45] ["... That doesn't sound like something a teacher would say."]
174: 1943| [47] [Ena]
175: 1946| [45] ["Well, teachers are surprisingly suspicious creatures. You can't protect the students you've sworn to keep safe if you trust every little thing."]
176: 1954| [47] [Watase]
177: 1957| [45] ["... Is that true?"]
178: 1965| [47] [Ena]
179: 1968| [45] ["There, that's the spirit. You have to doubt what I say too."]
180: 2013| [45] [The group arrived at Area 6 while they were talking.]
181: 2057| [45] [--Watase began handing out orders once they arrived at the factory.]
182: 2149| [47] [Watase]
183: 2152| [45] ["We're forming up into teams again. Moribe, you're with Teach. Old man, you're with me. Search whatever you can."]
184: 2160| [47] [Watase]
185: 2163| [45] ["Once you're done, return to the neuroscience laboratory for the time being."]
186: 2189| [47] [Jun]
187: 2192| [45] ["... Roger. Then we'll cover the factory, okay?"]
188: 2200| [47] [Ena]
189: 2203| [45] ["... Got it."]
190: 2229| [47] [Ukita]
191: 2232| [45] ["I suppose I have no objections."]
192: 2240| [47] [Watase]
193: 2243| [45] ["All right then, be careful, guys."]
194: 2248| [45] [With those words, Watase then parted ways with Ena's team.]
