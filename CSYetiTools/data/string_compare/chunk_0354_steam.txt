  0:   75| [45] [--It was a memory of when Salyu was still in France.]
  1:   80| [45] [The sights she saw spread before Natsuhiko's field of view.]
  2:   85| [45] [Salyu sat in front of a piano, thinking to herself.]
  3:   90| [45] ["My entire world lies within this estate"--]
  4:   95| [45] [Eventually, Salyu's tutor entered her room.]
  5:  130| [47] [Tutor]
  6:  133| [45] ["Louise, it's time for practice."]
  7:  138| [47] [Salyu]
  8:  141| [45] ["What are we playing today?"]
  9:  146| [45] [The tutor answered by giving Salyu her lesson plan for the day.]
 10:  151| [47] [Tutor]
 11:  154| [45] ["A new song today:"]
 12:  159| [47] [Tutor]
 13:  162| [45] ["Ravel's 'Gaspard de la nuit'."]
 14:  167| [47] [Tutor]
 15:  170| [45] ["Play it with feeling. With emotion."]
 16:  175| [45] [Salyu nodded and began to play the song.]
 17:  180| [45] [Her pale fingers wove smoothly over the ivory keyboard.]
 18:  185| [45] [But though her hands reproduced the beauty of the emotional melodies, her heart felt nothing.]
 19:  190| [45] [--Salyu was born and raised inside this estate.]
 20:  195| [45] [For some reason, her parents would not let her leave the grounds.]
 21:  200| [45] [Naturally, that meant she did not go to school.]
 22:  205| [45] [Instead, she was surrounded by the company of tutors of all sorts, and received training in just about every field imaginable.]
 23:  210| [45] [And, perhaps as a result of the tutors' excellence or perhaps the brilliance of Salyu's all-encompassing talent...]
 24:  215| [45] [Salyu had barely reached the age of 10 when she had gained a pool of knowledge both deep and wide.]
 25:  244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  245| [45] [(... It's just as Salyu told us.)]
 27:  250| [45] [Natsuhiko thought to himself as he watched that memory.]
 28:  255| [45] [The sight before him agreed with what Salyu had told him of her past a few days ago.]
 29:  260| [45] [But at that moment, Yuuri's voice echoed in his head.]
 30:  284| [47] [Yuuri]
 31:  287| [45] [{That's not it, Hikorin...!}]
 32:  292| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  295| [45] [{This memory is a fake. A false memory I created.}]
 34:  300| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  301| [45] [(... I knew it.)]
 36:  306| [45] [Yuuri had already told him that she had falsified Salyu's memory.]
 37:  311| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  312| [45] [(But why would you do this...?)]
 39:  336| [47] [Yuuri]
 40:  339| [45] [{... Because there was no other way to save her.}]
 41:  344| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  345| [45] [(... What's that supposed to mean?)]
 43:  369| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  372| [45] [{Let me restore the memory to how it was before I falsified it.}]
 45:  377| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  380| [45] [{Salyu's real memory--}]
 47:  768| [45] [At the moment Yuuri muttered that,]
 48:  773| [45] [the sight before them faded like mist.]
 49:  786| [45] [And beyond the veil of mist lied another, different sight.]
 50:  791| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  792| [45] [(... What is this...!?)]
 52:  797| [45] [Yuuri continued as Natsuhiko recoiled in bewilderment.]
 53:  860| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  863| [45] [{This poor girl has been shouldering a fate even more cruel than mine... So please, support her.}]
