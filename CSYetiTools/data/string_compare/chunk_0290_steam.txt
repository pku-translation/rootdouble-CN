  1:   97| [47] [Yuuri]
  2:  100| [45] ["Salyu disappeared too...?"]
  3:  129| [45] [Astonished by the turn of events, Natsuhiko tried using empathy on Watase.]
  4:  179| [45] [He then heard Watase's mental voice.]
  5:  470| [85] [{Did I take too long to get there...?]
  6:  472| [85] [She might have already woken up.}]
  7:  473| [86] [Watase]
  8:  474| [86] [{Did I take too long to get there...? She might have already woken up.}]
  9:  491| [85] [{But where would she go...?}]
 10:  492| [86] [Watase]
 11:  493| [86] [{But where would she go...?}]
 12:  649| [45] [Watase didn't appear to be lying, which was a relief to Natsuhiko.]
 13:  654| [45] [So basically, Salyu probably woke up and went somewhere else, just as Watase had surmised.]
 14:  659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  660| [45] [(In that case, I should be able to contact her through telepathy.)]
 16:  752| [45] [Natsuhiko tried doing so immediately.]
 17:  760| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  763| [45] [{--Salyu, can you hear me?}]
 19:  771| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  774| [45] [{Please respond mentally if you can. I'll listen for your answer through empathy.}]
 21:  779| [45] [And just as he had told her, he then tried using empathy on Salyu, but--]
 22:  784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  785| [45] [(...)]
 24:  790| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  791| [45] [(... Huh!?)]
 26:  796| [45] [No matter how many times he used empathy, he couldn't hear her mental voice.]
 27:  810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  811| [45] [(Wh-what's going on!? Why can't I communicate with Salyu!?)]
 29:  816| [45] [Natsuhiko panicked as he tried to think of possible reasons.]
 30:  821| [45] [But there was only one thing he could think of.]
 31:  873| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  874| [45] [(I see... Salyu's probably injected with AD.)]
 33:  879| [45] [Now that he thought about it, there were signs that Salyu had been injecting herself.]
 34:  884| [45] [Like how they had found empty AD ampules in places where she'd been.]
 35:  934| [45] [Or how she was able to grapple with Watase in the WX particle-contaminated Area N.]
 36:  939| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  940| [45] [(Salyu doesn't know that this place is actually a BC research facility...)]
 38:  945| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  946| [45] [(So she must've read a disaster prevention manual somewhere and kept injecting herself with AD under the belief that it's a radiation inhibitor.)]
 40:  961| [45] [But talking about that point with Watase would complicate matters.]
 41:  966| [45] [Natsuhiko concluded that Salyu waking up safely meant that she would probably be fine for the time being, so he changed the subject.]
 42:  974| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  977| [45] ["Do you think Salyu felt endangered and hid herself somewhere?"]
 44: 1003| [47] [Watase]
 45: 1006| [45] ["I sure hope so, but..."]
 46: 1014| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47: 1017| [45] ["... Something bugging you?"]
 48: 1043| [47] [Watase]
 49: 1046| [45] ["She... might be searching for me."]
 50: 1054| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51: 1057| [45] ["Huh?"]
 52: 1084| [47] [Yuuri]
 53: 1087| [45] ["Searching for you? Why...?"]
 54: 1119| [47] [Watase]
 55: 1122| [45] ["I've said this before, but... that girl doesn't trust me at all."]
 56: 1130| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1133| [45] ["She herself told me and Tachibana why."]
 58: 1159| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1162| [45] ["You were unconscious, Natsuhiko, but... do you remember hearing that conversation?"]
 60: 1170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1173| [45] ["N-no..."]
 62: 1199| [47] [Watase]
 63: 1202| [45] ["... I see."]
 64: 1207| [45] [Watase's expression rapidly became pensive.]
 65: 1212| [45] [And the more Watase thought, the more uneasy Natsuhiko got.]
 66: 1223| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1226| [45] ["... Say, Natsuhiko..."]
 68: 1281| [47] [Watase]
 69: 1284| [45] ["I know both you and that Mashiro girl got shot, but... did you happen to see the face of the shooter?"]
 70: 1292| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1295| [45] ["N-no, I didn't. He was hiding his face."]
 72: 1318| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1319| [45] ["..."]
 74: 1345| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1348| [45] ["... Honest?"]
 76: 1356| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1359| [45] ["Honest. Why do you ask?"]
 78: 1385| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1388| [45] ["Well... you might think it's weird for me to say this, but..."]
 80: 1414| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1417| [45] ["I can't keep silent about it any longer."]
 82: 1468| [45] [Watase drew closer to Natsuhiko and continued.]
 83: 1494| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1497| [45] ["The truth is, these strange images flash before my eyes whenever I see you kids!%NThey're so vivid, like they're my own memories...!"]
 85: 1505| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1508| [45] ["They're all disturbing images tinged with rage, fear, and bloodlust!"]
 87: 1516| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1519| [45] ["Like me fighting with some sort of 'monster' or shooting someone from behind!"]
 89: 1545| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1548| [45] ["So... maybe... I don't even want to think about it, but...!"]
 91: 1574| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1577| [45] ["Was I the one... who shot you kids!?"]
 93: 1600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1603| [45] ["Wha...!? What makes you think that!?"]
 95: 1629| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1632| [45] ["Salyu said... that I was a terrorist."]
 97: 1640| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1643| [45] ["That I was the one who shot you."]
 99: 1669| [47] [Watase]
100: 1672| [45] ["But I tried not to think about it... because I'm supposed to be a rescue squad captain."]
101: 1680| [47] [Watase]
102: 1683| [45] ["After hearing everything Tachibana and Moribe said about me, I thought there was no way I could be a terrorist."]
103: 1709| [47] [Watase]
104: 1712| [45] ["But what about you, Yuuri...? You've been afraid of me ever since you first saw me, haven't you?"]
105: 1747| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1750| [45] ["Ah, n-no..."]
107: 1758| [47] [Watase]
108: 1761| [45] ["Could it have been for the same reason...!?"]
109: 1787| [47] [Watase]
110: 1790| [45] ["Because I'm not a rescue squad captain, but a terrorist!?"]
111: 1816| [47] [Watase]
112: 1819| [45] ["Do you kids know who I really was before I lost my memory!?"]
113: 1827| [47] [Watase]
114: 1830| [45] ["Please, tell me!"]
115: 1853| [45] [Even Natsuhiko could see just how thoroughly confused Watase was.]
116: 1858| [45] [Watase was probably scared to know the truth.]
117: 1863| [45] [And Natsuhiko was scared to tell it to him. However--]
118: 1868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1869| [45] [(We can't keep this up...!)]
120: 1874| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1875| [45] [(It doesn't look like we can keep deceiving him like this for much longer!)]
122: 1880| [45] [Natsuhiko quietly asked a question.]
123: 1890| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1893| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... do you want to regain your lost memories?"]
125: 1931| [45] [Both Watase and Yuuri's eyes widened at those words.]
126: 1945| [47] [Yuuri]
127: 1948| [45] ["Hikorin!? What are you saying!?"]
128: 1956| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1959| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri. I know what I said earlier, but... now that he's noticed, we don't have much of a choice."]
130: 1985| [47] [Watase]
131: 1988| [45] ["Wha... what are you two talking about? You don't have a choice in regards to what exactly--?"]
132: 1999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2002| [45] ["Don't worry about that now, Captain Kasasagi. Please answer me. Do you want to regain your memory?"]
134: 2092| [47] [Watase]
135: 2095| [45] ["...!"]
136: 2103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2106| [45] ["Once you do regain your memories, it may very well change who you are."]
138: 2114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 2117| [45] ["The current 'Watase', the rescue squad captain who desperately struggled to save everyone's lives, could disappear."]
140: 2125| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2128| [45] ["Once you learn the truth, your perception of the world could change. Your relations with everyone around us could take an about face and make enemies out of everyone..."]
142: 2136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2139| [45] ["... And once you know the truth, there's no turning back."]
144: 2147| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2150| [45] ["Do you still want to regain your memory?"]
146: 2173| [45] [Watase silently pondered the question for a moment--]
147: 2199| [47] [Watase]
148: 2202| [45] ["... Yeah."]
149: 2207| [45] [And answered with a grave voice.]
150: 2233| [47] [Watase]
151: 2236| [45] ["... I can't stand being in the dark any longer."]
152: 2244| [47] [Watase]
153: 2247| [45] ["I can't stand considering the possibility that I could be a bad guy... when I don't even know what it is I've done."]
154: 2252| [45] [Natsuhiko understood Watase's bitter sentiment.]
155: 2257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2258| [45] [(... That's right.)]
157: 2263| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2264| [45] [(I thought you'd say something like that.)]
159: 2269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2270| [45] [(You want proof that your will to save everyone, even at the cost of your own life, is genuine, don't you...?)]
161: 2275| [45] [And with that consideration, Natsuhiko finally made up his mind.]
162: 2283| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2286| [45] ["... If that's the case, Captain Kasasagi, then allow me to tell you the truth."]
164: 2294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 2297| [45] ["I've been lying to you all this time."]
166: 2358| [47] [Watase]
167: 2361| [45] ["...!"]
168: 2369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2372| [45] ["Your suspicions were correct. The auditory hallucination you've been hearing was indeed my telepathy."]
170: 2431| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2434| [45] [{--Yes, just like this.}]
172: 2495| [47] [Watase]
173: 2498| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
174: 2536| [45] [Watase's face froze instantly.]
175: 2541| [45] [Natsuhiko continued as Watase stared at him in total shock.]
176: 2549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2552| [45] ["... Furthermore, I've been using empathy to listen to your mental voice all this time as well."]
178: 2560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2563| [45] ["I've also been sharing your senses. Everything you've seen, I've seen as well."]
180: 2571| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 2574| [45] ["But BC abilities don't stop there."]
182: 2582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2585| [45] ["... I can manipulate memories."]
184: 2593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2596| [45] ["Your memories disappeared because of me."]
186: 2601| [45] [Natsuhiko's words quietly echoed in the still shelter.]
