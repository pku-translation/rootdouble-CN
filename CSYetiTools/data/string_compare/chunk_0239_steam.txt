  1:   71| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   74| [45] ["!!"]
  3:   79| [45] [He looked back to see the man standing by the entrance of the small room.]
  4:   84| [45] [The man glared at Natsuhiko with his gun at his waist.]
  5:   89| [45] [Natsuhiko immediately focused and sent a full-force wave of telepathy with all of his willpower.]
  6:  154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  157| [45] [{STOP!!!!!!}]
  8:  162| [45] [--But the man didn't falter one bit.]
  9:  170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  173| [45] ["!?"]
 11:  238| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  241| [45] [{Don't move!!!!!!}]
 13:  246| [45] [He tried one more time, but the man showed no hint of any change.]
 14:  251| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  252| [45] [(It's not working! Is he withstanding it!?)]
 16:  278| [47] [Man]
 17:  281| [45] ["... Telepathy, eh? You caught me off guard back there, but it's not going to work again."]
 18:  389| [45] [And with that, the man leapt at Natsuhiko.]
 19:  397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  400| [45] ["Aghh!!"]
 21:  489| [45] [The man grabbed him by the neck and pulled him in with frightening strength.]
 22:  494| [45] [His fierce glare pierced Natsuhiko like a sword.]
 23:  502| [47] [Man]
 24:  505| [45] ["What happened to the girl?"]
 25:  513| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  516| [45] ["... Who gives a damn?"]
 27:  521| [45] [The moment he answered that,]
 28:  604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  607| [45] ["!!"]
 30:  612| [45] [the man's fist sank into Natsuhiko's gut.]
 31:  620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  623| [45] ["Gah... hah..."]
 33:  628| [45] [It felt as if his stomach had ruptured. He couldn't breathe.]
 34:  650| [45] [The man quietly scanned the room and took notice of the broken control panel.]
 35:  677| [47] [Man]
 36:  680| [45] ["Tch... clever kid!"]
 37:  759| [45] [The man clicked his tongue and beat Natsuhiko in the face.]
 38:  767| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  770| [45] ["...!!!"]
 40:  775| [45] [Lights flashed before Natsuhiko's eyes and for a moment, his consciousness threatened to cut out.]
 41:  780| [45] [He heard the man's voice through the ringing in his ears.]
 42:  807| [47] [Man]
 43:  810| [45] ["You damn Communicators really rub me the wrong way...!"]
 44:  818| [47] [Man]
 45:  821| [45] ["So even a pack of monsters like you can value your friends, huh?"]
 46:  829| [47] [Man]
 47:  832| [45] ["I didn't know you monsters even had it in you."]
 48:  837| [45] [The man's voice was full of pitch black hate.]
 49:  842| [45] [Ena's words played back in Natsuhiko's ear.]
 50:  931| [45] ["What supports Q's belief is a hatred of the unknown."]
 51:  936| [45] ["The mere thought that 'they're not like us' is enough to incite them to hate others, ostracize them, and injure them. Their mentality is abnormal...!"]
 52: 1013| [45] [He felt like he'd caught a glimpse of that mentality now.]
 53: 1018| [45] [--So Natsuhiko stood up to fight against that hatred.]
 54: 1026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1029| [45] ["O-of course we do...!"]
 56: 1037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1040| [45] ["I don't know why you hate us so much! Communicators are people too!"]
 58: 1048| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1051| [45] ["But we don't hate ordinary people without reason!"]
 60: 1059| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1062| [45] ["We don't set towns on fire. We don't set bombs. And we don't shoot people indiscriminately, either!"]
 62: 1070| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1073| [45] ["We're not like you, you terrorists!"]
 64: 1097| [47] [Man]
 65: 1098| [45] ["--"]
 66: 1103| [45] [Natsuhiko could hear the man gasp.]
 67: 1108| [45] [Eventually, the man smiled and his voice echoed.]
 68: 1135| [47] [Man]
 69: 1138| [45] ["Khh... khahahah... hahahahahah!!"]
 70: 1165| [47] [Man]
 71: 1168| [45] ["Well, no shit! No proper human would!"]
 72: 1195| [47] [Man]
 73: 1198| [45] ["But it's pretty ballsy of you to say that to my face, kid. Your kind killed over a hundred people!!"]
 74: 1206| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1209| [45] ["!?"]
 76: 1214| [45] [Natsuhiko's eyes widened at those words.]
 77: 1219| [45] [The man tightened his grip around Natsuhiko's neck and continued.]
 78: 1246| [47] [Man]
 79: 1249| [45] ["Look, you Communicator... Even if you don't know it, I've got a perfectly good reason to hate your kind."]
 80: 1257| [47] [Man]
 81: 1260| [45] ["You have precious friends, right? Well there was someone who was more precious to me than anyone else."]
 82: 1268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1271| [45] ["Wh... what are you... talking about...!?"]
 84: 1298| [47] [Man]
 85: 1301| [45] ["You don't know? Nah, of course you don't. What's one more dead kid in a list of 118 casualties?"]
 86: 1309| [47] [Man]
 87: 1312| [45] ["But that kid was my other half. My very mirror image."]
 88: 1320| [47] [Man]
 89: 1323| [45] ["Weak, but motivated. Stupid, but gentle. The very embodiment of light to me."]
 90: 1331| [47] [Man]
 91: 1334| [45] ["But that light died. And all that's left is a dark shadow."]
 92: 1361| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1364| [45] ["... That's me. That's Watase Kasasagi."]
 94: 1372| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1375| [45] ["Burn that name into your ears. Carve it into your mind. Reflect on that name until the moment you die!!"]
 96: 1380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1381| [45] [(W... Watase Kasasagi...!?)]
 98: 1386| [45] [It was a name he had never heard before.]
 99: 1391| [45] [Natsuhiko had no idea what the man was talking about.]
100: 1443| [45] [But the man didn't sweat the details as he slipped the gun out from his waist.]
101: 1448| [45] [At that moment, Natsuhiko froze.]
102: 1453| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1454| [45] [(He's gonna shoot!?)]
104: 1459| [45] [All doubt flew away from his mind.]
105: 1464| [45] [And in its place-- he recalled a conversation he once had with Salyu.]
106: 1545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1548| [45] ["--You threw that security guard today, didn't you? Do you think I can learn to do that too?"]
108: 1574| [47] [Salyu]
109: 1577| [45] ["Dabbling just a bit in martial arts won't help much. But there are techniques that even amateurs can use."]
110: 1603| [47] [Salyu]
111: 1606| [45] ["If someone tries to grab you by the neck--"]
112: 1690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1691| [45] [("If someone tries to grab you by the neck"--!!)]
114: 1696| [45] [As soon as he remembered,]
115: 1701| [45] [Natsuhiko's body moved on its own.]
116: 1734| [47] [Watase]
117: 1737| [45] ["!?"]
118: 1742| [45] [He grabbed the man's wrist back--]
119: 1835| [45] [--and nimbly wrapped around behind him.]
120: 1843| [47] [Watase]
121: 1846| [45] ["Guh...!?"]
122: 1851| [45] [The man braced his legs.]
123: 1856| [45] [But with a vigorous yell,]
124: 1864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1867| [45] ["Dyaaaahhh!"]
126: 2051| [45] [Natsuhiko threw the man down.]
127: 2059| [47] [Watase]
128: 2062| [45] ["Gagh!!"]
129: 2067| [45] [The man's body struck the floor.]
130: 2072| [45] [That was the shihonage-- the only technique Salyu taught him.]
131: 2077| [45] [As he fell, something dropped from the man's pocket--]
132: 2132| [45] [--A card with "Lv. N" written on it--]
133: 2137| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2138| [45] [(A security card! If I just break it!!)]
135: 2163| [45] [Natsuhiko picked up the card and snapped it in two.]
136: 2216| [45] [And at the same time, the man got up.]
137: 2221| [45] [He was still holding the gun in his hand.]
138: 2226| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 2227| [45] [(Is he going to shoot!? No--)]
140: 2232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2233| [45] [(If I keep running away, I can trap him!)]
142: 2247| [45] [Natsuhiko turned back and tried to dash out of the room.]
143: 2273| [45] [But then a gunshot rang out,]
144: 2335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2338| [45] ["!!"]
146: 2343| [45] [and Natsuhiko's left arm popped.]
147: 2355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2358| [45] ["Gggghhhhh!!"]
149: 2363| [45] [He shouted against his will.]
150: 2368| [45] [He was struck by intense pain as if he had been hit by a blunt force weapon in the upper arm and his brain were burning.]
151: 2376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2379| [45] ["Gugh, uugh..."]
153: 2387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2390| [45] ["... Uwaaaahhhh!!"]
155: 2395| [45] [Natsuhiko withstood the intense pain and tumbled out of the room.]
156: 2458| [45] [He ran into the fire, applying pressure to his arm.]
157: 2463| [45] [He took the split card and threw it into the blazing flames.]
158: 2468| [45] [A shout shot up from behind him.]
159: 2575| [47] [Watase]
160: 2578| [45] ["You think you can break my card and lock me in so I can't chase you, huh?"]
161: 2583| [45] [Natsuhiko looked back to see the man standing behind the flames.]
162: 2588| [45] [The man took out another card from his pocket to replace the one Natsuhiko destroyed.]
163: 2596| [47] [Watase]
164: 2599| [45] ["Too bad that wasn't my only card. I came prepared."]
165: 2657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2660| [45] ["...!"]
167: 2668| [47] [Watase]
168: 2671| [45] ["So don't even think you're getting away, Communicator!!"]
169: 2679| [47] [Watase]
170: 2682| [45] ["I will find you, and I will kill you! I swear!"]
171: 2687| [45] [Natsuhiko shook off that voice and ran.]
172: 2692| [45] [And thus began his desperate fight for his life in the underground facility without an exit.]
173: 2839| [45] [He ran recklessly through the factory towards another area.]
174: 2844| [45] [But that area was also wrapped in flames, the heat waves tormenting Natsuhiko.]
175: 2849| [45] [As he ran, his breathing grew rough. Blood oozed out of his arm and side. His body was gradually losing strength.]
176: 2854| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2855| [45] [(D-dammit... What do I do?)]
178: 2860| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2861| [45] [(How do I defeat him...!?)]
180: 2866| [45] [The telepathy attacks weren't working on him.]
181: 2871| [45] [His heart obviously wasn't open, so Natsuhiko couldn't use empathy.]
182: 2876| [45] [And the throwing techniques weren't enough to do any real damage.]
183: 2881| [45] [No matter how much Natsuhiko kept running, he would be overtaken and shot to death.]
184: 2920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2921| [45] [(If I at least had some sort of weapon...!)]
186: 2943| [45] [He looked around and soon realized--]
187: 2948| [45] [--he could use the fires surrounding him as a weapon!]
188: 2968| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 2971| [45] ["...!"]
190: 2997| [45] [Natsuhiko kicked the burning wall with all his strength.]
191: 3002| [45] [The wallboard tore off and fell to the floor.]
192: 3007| [45] [He held the board to the fire, setting it aflame as a sort of makeshift torch.]
193: 3075| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 3076| [45] [(It's do or die, huh... If I could just hit him in the face with this...!)]
195: 3081| [45] [If it worked out, he could blind the man.]
196: 3086| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko hid himself under cover.]
197: 3097| [45] [Eventually, he heard the area gate open.]
198: 3157| [45] [Heavy footsteps approached.]
199: 3162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 3163| [45] [(Wait for it... Don't go until the last second.)]
201: 3168| [45] [Natsuhiko lowered his breath, concealed himself completely, and waited for the right timing--]
202: 3223| [45] [--and then he jumped out of cover and hurled the burning board at the man's face.]
203: 3262| [47] [Watase]
204: 3265| [45] ["!"]
205: 3270| [45] [The man shrank back for a second.]
206: 3275| [45] [The board flew towards his face--]
207: 3321| [45] [But right before impact, he swatted it out of the air with his arm.]
208: 3329| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3332| [45] ["Ah..."]
210: 3358| [47] [Watase]
211: 3361| [45] ["... What was that supposed to be?"]
212: 3369| [47] [Watase]
213: 3372| [45] ["Please, you didn't think this would defeat me, did you?"]
214: 3377| [45] [The man spoke in disappointment as he casually shot his gun.]
215: 3406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3409| [45] ["!!"]
217: 3414| [45] [A third bullet gouged itself into Natsuhiko's body, this time in the right leg.]
218: 3467| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 3470| [45] ["Khh... guh...!!"]
220: 3475| [45] [He leaned against the wall.]
221: 3516| [45] [But he put up with the pain and forced his legs to run away.]
222: 3521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 3522| [45] [(Is he going to shoot me in the back!?)]
224: 3527| [45] [He thought so, but the man did not.]
225: 3532| [45] [Instead of a gunshot, he heard a scoffing voice.]
226: 3561| [47] [Watase]
227: 3564| [45] ["Don't think I'll just -give- you the repose of death."]
228: 3572| [47] [Watase]
229: 3575| [45] ["That's it. Run, run, run, you damn Communicator."]
230: 3601| [47] [Watase]
231: 3604| [45] ["Just like how we ran in the hospital that night."]
232: 3644| [45] [The man kept speaking unintelligibly as he made his leisurely pursuit.]
233: 3649| [45] [Natsuhiko's voice overflowed with bitterness.]
234: 3663| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3666| [45] ["... Dammit...!"]
236: 3674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 3677| [45] ["Dammit, dammit, dammit...!"]
238: 3682| [45] [Natsuhiko cursed over and over as he ran for his life.]
239: 3687| [45] [Searching for a way to defeat the man and survive.]
240: 3692| [45] [Searching for a glimmer of hope in the midst of despair--]
