  0:   80| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 3]
  1:   91| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   94| [45] ["... Haaah!!"]
  3:  112| [45] [Natsuhiko sprung up in bed.]
  4:  162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  165| [45] ["Ah... Huh?"]
  6:  170| [45] [For a second, he couldn't tell where he was.]
  7:  265| [45] [He took a look around before coming to the slow realization that he was in his room.]
  8:  276| [45] [His heart was still thumping hard.]
  9:  285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  288| [45] ["... That same dream again..."]
 11:  293| [45] [Every so often, Natsuhiko would wake up from a nightmare like this.]
 12:  298| [45] [But every time he'd wake up, he'd forget about the particulars of the nightmare.]
 13:  303| [45] [It probably had something to do with "that day" nine years ago. Or perhaps--]
 14:  311| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  314| [45] ["What a way to start the morning..."]
 16:  319| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head in frustration before changing and leaving the room.]
 17:  629| [45] [When he got to the living room, Yuuri and Salyu were already there.]
 18:  661| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  664| [45] ["Good morning, Hikorin~"]
 20:  687| [47] [Salyu]
 21:  688| [45] ["..."]
 22:  693| [45] [Yuuri greeted him with a warm smile. Salyu on the other hand just looked at him silently.]
 23:  839| [45] [Yesterday still seemed hard to believe: a beautiful French-Japanese prodigy abruptly moved into his house--]
 24:  877| [45] [But apparently it was no dream.]
 25:  885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  888| [45] ["Uhm, good morning, Yuuri, ... Salyu."]
 27:  893| [45] [Not used to greetings, Salyu awkwardly attempted a reply.]
 28:  919| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  922| [45] ["... Morning."]
 30:  927| [45] [The moment Salyu said that, Mashiro popped out of the kitchen.]
 31:  999| [47] [Mashiro]
 32: 1002| [45] ["Ah, good morning, Natsuhiko!"]
 33: 1016| [47] [Mashiro]
 34: 1019| [45] ["Breakfast is just about ready. Help me prepare."]
 35: 1027| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36: 1030| [45] ["Oh, sure."]
 37: 1035| [45] [Mashiro seemed to be the same as always.]
 38: 1103| [45] [Natsuhiko went through the motions of helping to prepare for breakfast.]
 39: 1108| [45] [And soon enough, a small family-sized portion of French toast, salad, and some coffee was laid out on the table.]
 40: 1303| [47] [Mashiro]
 41: 1306| [45] ["I tried matching today's breakfast to how it's done in Salyu's home country."]
 42: 1332| [47] [Mashiro]
 43: 1335| [45] ["The salad has French dressing and the coffee is French roast!"]
 44: 1361| [47] [Yuuri]
 45: 1364| [45] ["It's all French style, huh~. Mmm, looks delicious again today~"]
 46: 1422| [47] [Salyu]
 47: 1425| [45] ["... Mmm."]
 48: 1433| [47] [Mashiro]
 49: 1436| [45] ["Okay, everyone, put your hands together--"]
 50: 1473| [47] [All 4]
 51: 1476| [45] ["Thanks for the food."]
 52: 1487| [45] [And thus, they began to eat, leaving Natsuhiko's bewilderment unresolved.]
 53: 1615| [45] [Mashiro and Yuuri were the same as always.]
 54: 1653| [45] [But the addition of Salyu made this no ordinary morning.]
 55: 1658| [45] [That was what bewildered Natsuhiko.]
 56: 1737| [45] [--And then, after breakfast was over--]
 57: 1760| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu had to go to school, so they turned the lights on on their way out.]
 58: 1829| [45] [The three of them departed, leaving Yuuri at home.]
