  1:   55| [45] [--]
  2:   60| [45] [----]
  3:   65| [45] [------His consciousness was in an endless darkness.]
  4:   76| [47] [???]
  5:   77| [45] [(Where am I...?)]
  6:   82| [45] [He didn't know.]
  7:   87| [45] [His head was a total blank.]
  8:   92| [47] [???]
  9:   93| [45] [(What is this...?)]
 10:   98| [45] [He couldn't remember a thing.]
 11:  103| [47] [???]
 12:  104| [45] [(How did this happen?)]
 13:  109| [45] [He desperately tried to figure out why.]
 14:  114| [45] [Soon enough, a mysterious voice whispered in the corners of his mind.]
 15:  119| [45] [As if praying for him to "awaken"--]
 16:  127| [47] [Me]
 17:  130| [45] ["..."]
 18:  138| [47] [Me]
 19:  141| [45] ["... Ugh.. ghh..."]
 20:  287| [45] [... --I wake up in some unfamilar place.]
 21:  292| [47] [Me]
 22:  293| [45] [(...?)]
 23:  306| [47] [Me]
 24:  307| [45] [(Where am I...?)]
 25:  318| [45] [With that thought in mind, I look around. I find myself lying in some sort of bed.]
 26:  331| [45] [Immaculate white sheets and the wafting scent of antiseptics... Looks like I'm in a hospital room of some sort.]
 27:  336| [45] [I see what appears to be a policeman standing in a corner of the room.]
 28:  341| [45] [And beside the bed, a boy and girl are looking at my face.]
 29:  403| [47] [Boy]
 30:  406| [45] ["Ah...! You're awake...!"]
 31:  415| [47] [Girl]
 32:  418| [45] ["Th-thank goodness...! Captain Kasasagi, do you know who we are?"]
 33:  423| [45] [It looks like they know me.]
 34:  430| [45] [With that--]
 35:  438| [47] [Watase]
 36:  441| [45] ["Na... Natsuhiko and... Yuuri...?"]
 37:  446| [45] [I "remember" them.]
 38:  503| [45] [I sit up in the bed and focus fully on them.]
 39:  511| [47] [Watase]
 40:  514| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this!? How the hell do I still remember you guys!?"]
 41:  522| [47] [Watase]
 42:  525| [45] ["No... not just you guys... I remember everything...! How...?"]
 43:  569| [45] [It's not just Natsuhiko and Yuuri I remember.]
 44:  574| [45] [I remember it all-- every detail of my 32 years of life as Watase Kasasagi, the fact I'm a terrorist, the nine hours we spent trapped in LABO, our escape-- all of it--!]
 45:  624| [45] [And how at the end of it all, I held Natsuhiko at gunpoint and forced him to make a decision.]
 46:  629| [45] [Natsuhiko answered by saying he'd use Senses Sympathy on me and--]
 47:  668| [45] [No, what happened after that is the one thing that's a total blank.]
 48:  676| [47] [Watase]
 49:  679| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, explain..."]
 50:  687| [47] [Watase]
 51:  690| [45] ["Didn't you erase all of my memories?"]
 52:  698| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  701| [45] ["... No, I didn't."]
 54:  709| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  712| [45] ["The only thing I erased-- was your memory of 'that second'."]
 56:  720| [47] [Watase]
 57:  723| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
 58:  770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  773| [45] ["... I couldn't let you take Yuuri away. No chance in hell. But I didn't want to erase you either."]
 60:  781| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  784| [45] ["So just like I did before... I just took out a very small part of your memories to knock you unconscious."]
 62:  792| [47] [Watase]
 63:  795| [45] ["...!"]
 64:  800| [45] [Upon hearing those words, I finally realize what he's getting at.]
 65:  805| [45] [--Back when I was trapped in LABO that day and still had amnesia--]
 66:  875| [45] [Natsuhiko knocked me unconscious by erasing my "current memory" when our minds were linked in order to protect Salyu.]
 67:  880| [45] [He did that one more time to protect Yuuri.]
 68:  983| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  986| [45] ["... I figured that only erasing a very small part of your memory would minimize the shock of the memory loss..."]
 70:  994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  997| [45] ["But I was still worried that you might've died."]
 72: 1005| [47] [Yuuri]
 73: 1008| [45] ["... Hikorin has been waiting for you to wake up ever since then."]
 74: 1016| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1019| [45] ["He prayed from the bottom of his heart for you to survive."]
 76: 1027| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1030| [45] ["... I see..."]
 78: 1035| [45] [And so I survived.]
 79: 1040| [45] [Not as a complete blank slate all over again, but as the terrorist I am.]
 80: 1048| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1051| [45] ["... So this is your answer, Natsuhiko?"]
 82: 1098| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1101| [45] ["Yeah... this was the best I could do."]
 84: 1106| [45] [Natsuhiko sounds guilty about all this, so I give him a wry smile.]
 85: 1114| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1117| [45] ["... Don't look so down."]
 87: 1125| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1128| [45] ["You made the completely right choice. I lost, fair and square."]
 89: 1172| [45] [Natsuhiko has nothing to say to that.]
 90: 1177| [45] [I really don't like silence, so I continue.]
 91: 1185| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1188| [45] ["Anyway, how long's it been since then? How're the others?"]
 93: 1196| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1199| [45] ["It's been three days. Everyone's okay. They've all been taken into the care of the ESP Bureau, so they're in a safe place now."]
 95: 1207| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1210| [45] ["Then this hospital--"]
 97: 1218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1221| [45] ["Yeah. It's a police hospital outside of Rokumei City."]
 99: 1268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1271| [45] ["Waiting just outside the door is Prof. Tsubakiyama... and her coworkers."]
101: 1279| [47] [Watase]
102: 1282| [45] ["So they've come to arrest me, huh..."]
103: 1290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1293| [45] ["... Yeah. They arrested Mr. Ukita too right after we all escaped."]
105: 1298| [45] [Naturally, they've already taken my gun from me.]
106: 1303| [45] [That way I can't take Yuuri away even if I wanted to.]
107: 1308| [45] [Of course, I had no intention of doing so, but--]
108: 1316| [47] [Watase]
109: 1319| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko, Yuuri, can I ask you guys something?"]
110: 1366| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1369| [45] ["What?"]
112: 1377| [47] [Watase]
113: 1380| [45] ["Why did you guys wait for me to wake up? I could have gone berserk and tried to take Yuuri away once I did for all you know."]
114: 1388| [47] [Watase]
115: 1391| [45] ["You guys should've stayed away from me and run off to somewhere safe instead. So why..."]
116: 1396| [45] [The two of them calmly answer my question.]
117: 1443| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1446| [45] ["... The reason we didn't is because we had faith you wouldn't do something like that."]
119: 1454| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1457| [45] ["We waited for you to wake up... because I wanted to apologize for breaking my promise to go with you..."]
121: 1465| [47] [Watase]
122: 1468| [45] ["... I see."]
123: 1476| [47] [Watase]
124: 1479| [45] ["Hahah... you guys are good kids."]
125: 1484| [45] [I find myself saying that in an unexpectedly gentle voice.]
126: 1489| [45] [Their answers warm my heart.]
127: 1533| [45] [Hearing that they trusted me makes me incredibly happy for some reason.]
128: 1538| [45] [Even though I know their trust won't erase my crimes...]
129: 1546| [47] [Watase]
130: 1549| [45] ["... Guess they'll put me on trial sooner or later."]
131: 1596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1599| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Watase. Not only did I break our promise, but it's all my fault you have to go through that..."]
133: 1607| [47] [Watase]
134: 1610| [45] ["What're you apologizing for, you fool? Be proud of yourself. You did the right thing."]
135: 1618| [47] [Watase]
136: 1621| [45] ["It's just like you said... I should be tried by the law for my crimes."]
137: 1629| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1632| [45] ["... That's true."]
139: 1640| [47] [Watase]
140: 1643| [45] ["I'll spend the rest of my life in atonement. Up until the day I die."]
141: 1651| [47] [Watase]
142: 1654| [45] ["I've already resigned myself to that... but there's just one regret I have left."]
143: 1662| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1665| [45] ["Regret...?"]
145: 1673| [47] [Watase]
146: 1676| [45] ["How in the end I failed to hold the Rokumei City government accountable for their wrongdoings."]
147: 1681| [45] [That truly is the one thing I regret.]
148: 1686| [45] [I look off into the distance and continue.]
149: 1694| [47] [Watase]
150: 1697| [45] ["... I lost two comrades that day."]
151: 1705| [47] [Watase]
152: 1708| [45] ["Our methods were wrong. It'd probably be true to say that I'm reaping what I sowed. But..."]
153: 1716| [47] [Watase]
154: 1719| [45] ["Our desire to bring judgement upon the true villains-- Rokumei City's puppetmasters...%NThat desire was genuine."]
155: 1727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1730| [45] ["..."]
157: 1738| [47] [Watase]
158: 1741| [45] ["That city has been stomping on far too many lives for far too long. Lives like Nagisa's..."]
159: 1749| [47] [Watase]
160: 1752| [45] ["... Will her spirit and everyone else's ever truly be at a rest? Will the city just keep repeating the same mistakes?"]
161: 1760| [47] [Watase]
162: 1763| [45] ["I can no longer bring the dead any final closure... That's the one thing I regret from the bottom of my heart."]
163: 1768| [45] [I grit my teeth in frustration.]
164: 1773| [45] [But at that moment--]
165: 1820| [45] [Natsuhiko takes my hand and speaks.]
166: 1828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 1831| [45] ["... I won't let your feelings go to waste."]
168: 1839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 1842| [45] ["We'll make sure to carry them on."]
170: 1850| [47] [Watase]
171: 1853| [45] ["... Huh?"]
172: 1866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 1869| [45] ["Watase, we were touched by the minds and feelings of everyone in the facility that day. Including yours."]
174: 1877| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 1880| [45] ["All of them have carved a conviction into my mind as well... That city cannot be left to its own devices."]
176: 1888| [47] [Watase]
177: 1891| [45] ["...!"]
178: 1896| [45] [A light of determination fills Natsuhiko's eyes.]
179: 1901| [45] [Yuuri nods and continues.]
180: 1909| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 1912| [45] ["We're working to reveal the truth they've kept hidden all these years, and change the city."]
182: 1920| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 1923| [45] ["We won't resort to terrorism... but you and Mr. Ukita will get the fight you hoped for."]
184: 1931| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 1934| [45] ["... It's likely we'll be putting ourselves in danger by doing this."]
186: 1942| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 1945| [45] ["We don't know how long it'll take for the battle to end once it starts."]
188: 1953| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 1956| [45] ["But we have comrades on our side. Mashiro, Salyu, Mom, Prof. Tsubakiyama, Ms. Tachibana and Jun..."]
190: 1964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 1967| [45] ["So we promise we'll put an end to that city's mistakes. We'll ensure no one else has to be sacrificed."]
192: 1975| [47] [Watase]
193: 1978| [45] ["... You guys...!"]
194: 1983| [45] [The looks on their faces are no longer those of children, but adults.]
195: 1988| [45] [Natsuhiko firmly grips my hand and continues.]
196: 1996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 1999| [45] ["... By the time you've finished your atonement, I'm sure the world will be a much better place."]
198: 2007| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 2010| [45] ["So let's meet again in that better world."]
200: 2018| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 2021| [45] ["Not as a terrorist and a Communicator--"]
202: 2029| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2032| [45] ["But as 'comrades' who survived that day in LABO together."]
204: 2040| [47] [Watase]
205: 2043| [45] ["... Yeah!"]
206: 2048| [45] [And with that answer, I grip Natsuhiko's hand back.]
207: 2098| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%N]
208: 2103| [45] [--I have no more regrets.%NI know for sure that Natsuhiko and the others will inherit my conviction and the will of the dead.]
209: 2107| [85] [ã€€]
210: 2112| [45] [So I've decided to have faith.%NI believe that their ideals will change that insidious, cruel city.]
211: 2116| [85] [ã€€]
212: 2121| [45] [Then, after this era of crime finally ends,%Nthey should find themselves blessed with new days.]
213: 2125| [85] [ã€€]
214: 2130| [45] [I pray from the bottom of my heart that they have a shining future waiting ahead of them...]
