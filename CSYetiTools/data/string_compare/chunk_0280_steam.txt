  0:   60| [45] [--But that was the only time Yuuri felt such pain--]
  1:   65| [45] [Her days devoted to experimentation went by fairly calmly after that.]
  2:   70| [45] [Before she had realized it, three months had passed since Yuuri had come to LABO.]
  3:   99| [45] [A personal bedroom had been made for Yuuri underneath LABO.]
  4:  105| [45] [As she surveyed her new room, Yuuri thought to herself.]
  5:  110| [47] [Yuuri]
  6:  111| [45] [(Hmm, there's a lot more stuff here now, huh...)]
  7:  116| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa did her best to accommodate Yuuri.]
  8:  121| [45] [She gave Yuuri everything she wanted-- girly clothes, piles of books, anything.]
  9:  126| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  127| [45] [(It's a little inconvenient... but it's a lot better than the life I've lived before.)]
 11:  174| [45] [Just as that thought passed through Yuuri's head, the room door opened and Dr. Tenkawa came in.]
 12:  182| [47] [Miyoko]
 13:  185| [45] ["Yuuri, it's time for experiments."]
 14:  193| [47] [Yuuri]
 15:  196| [45] ["Ah, okay~"]
 16:  201| [45] [Yuuri smiled in reply to the professor's gentle voice.]
 17:  250| [45] [--According to Dr. Tenkawa, Yuuri's real parents had been told directly after the accident that their daughter had died due to the fire.]
 18:  255| [45] [They apparently accepted the explanation without question and left town immediately.]
 19:  260| [45] [Since they were by no means nice parents, Yuuri was not at all sad that she could no longer see them.]
 20:  291| [45] [She was actually happier to be showered with plenty of love from Dr. Tenkawa instead.]
 21:  384| [45] [Yuuri went with the professor to the laboratory in Area 5.]
 22:  392| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  395| [45] ["What are we doing today?"]
 24:  403| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  406| [45] ["Another memory manipulation experiment, continuing off from yesterday."]
 26:  414| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  417| [45] ["All righty, I'll try my best."]
 28:  422| [45] [After knocking the mouse unconscious, Yuuri underwent various other memory manipulation training sessions.]
 29:  427| [45] [Today seemed to be a continuation of that, but--]
 30:  453| [47] [Miyoko]
 31:  456| [45] ["Now then, I'll be your target for today."]
 32:  464| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  467| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 34:  475| [47] [Miyoko]
 35:  478| [45] ["I want to experience memory manipulation firsthand."]
 36:  486| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  489| [45] ["But... isn't it dangerous...?"]
 38:  515| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  518| [45] ["Don't worry. Even if you erase a few seconds of memory, it shouldn't cause that much damage."]
 40:  526| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  529| [45] ["I-I understand... Okay, then let's start with memory erasure."]
 42:  562| [45] [As Yuuri spoke, she took a pen and wrote a few letters on a piece of paper.]
 43:  567| [45] [When Yuuri finished writing "Orihime", she showed the piece of paper to the professor.]
 44:  575| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  578| [45] ["Okay, Professor. Try to memorize this."]
 46:  604| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  607| [45] ["'Orihime', hmm? Okay, I've memorized it."]
 48:  615| [47] [Yuuri]
 49:  618| [45] ["Okay, then I'll erase that memory...!"]
 50:  644| [45] [Yuuri reached out her hand-- and touched the professor's cheek.]
 51:  799| [45] [At that very same moment, the professor's consciousness streamed into Yuuri's brain.]
 52:  804| [45] [She called out the memory she wanted from among the extensive collection of complicated memories.]
 53:  809| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  810| [45] [(Ah, this must be it.)]
 55:  959| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  962| [45] ["'Orihime', hmm? Okay, I've memorized it."]
 57:  967| [45] [It was a vision of what had happened about 10 seconds ago, but from Dr. Tenkawa's point of view.]
 58:  989| [47] [Yuuri]
 59:  990| [45] [(Erase this memory...!)]
 60:  995| [45] [Yuuri focused hard and destroyed that part of the memory.]
 61: 1105| [47] [Miyoko]
 62: 1108| [45] ["'---hime', hmm? Okay, I've memorized it."]
 63: 1161| [47] [Miyoko]
 64: 1164| [45] ["'-------', hmm? Okay, I've --------- it."]
 65: 1217| [47] [Miyoko]
 66: 1220| [45] ["'-------', hmm? ----, -----------------."]
 67: 1231| [47] [Miyoko]
 68: 1232| [45] ["----------------------------------------"]
 69: 1237| [45] [The meaning of the words disappeared and the visuals became covered with static.]
 70: 1283| [45] [The memory disintegrated into dust and disappeared into the darkness of the professor's consciousness.]
 71: 1489| [47] [Miyoko]
 72: 1492| [45] ["Ugh...!"]
 73: 1497| [45] [When Yuuri returned to reality, she saw the professor groan in pain.]
 74: 1505| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1508| [45] ["A-are you okay!?"]
 76: 1534| [47] [Miyoko]
 77: 1537| [45] ["My head hurts a little... but I'm okay. No need to worry."]
 78: 1542| [45] [Yuuri was relieved to hear the professor's words.]
 79: 1550| [47] [Yuuri]
 80: 1553| [45] ["In that case, question time: what did I write?"]
 81: 1579| [47] [Miyoko]
 82: 1582| [45] ["Huh... mmm...?"]
 83: 1605| [45] [There was a stumped look on the professor's normally wise and intellectual face.]
 84: 1610| [45] [Yuuri found it somewhat amusing, so she teased her.]
 85: 1618| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1621| [45] ["Bzzzt! Time's up. The answer was 'Orihime'~"]
 87: 1647| [47] [Miyoko]
 88: 1650| [45] ["Ah, 'Orihime', hmm? All right, I've memorized it for sure this time."]
 89: 1658| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1661| [45] ["Okay, so next up is memory alteration."]
 91: 1687| [47] [Miyoko]
 92: 1690| [45] ["Okay, whenever you're ready."]
 93: 1698| [47] [Yuuri]
 94: 1701| [45] ["Here I go~"]
 95: 1753| [45] [Yuuri wished strongly to connect with the professor's mind.]
 96: 1911| [45] [And once again, the professor's consciousness streamed into Yuuri's brain.]
 97: 1916| [45] [Yuuri called out the memory of a few seconds ago.]
 98: 2056| [47] [Miyoko]
 99: 2059| [45] ["Ah, 'Orihime', hmm? All right, I've memorized it for sure this time."]
100: 2081| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 2082| [45] [(Change this memory...!)]
102: 2087| [45] [Yuuri focused hard, and--]
103: 2209| [47] [Miyoko]
104: 2212| [45] ["Ah, 'Orihime', hmm? All right, I've memorized it for sure this time."]
105: 2301| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 2304| [45] ["Ah, '-------', hmm? All right, I've memorized it for sure this time."]
107: 2393| [47] [Miyoko]
108: 2396| [45] ["Ah, 'Hikoboshi', hmm? All right, I've memorized it for sure this time."]
109: 2440| [45] [The vision of the memory warped itself into another memory.]
110: 2623| [45] [When Yuuri returned to reality, the professor looked blankly at her.]
111: 2649| [47] [Miyoko]
112: 2652| [45] ["... Oh my, are you already done?"]
113: 2660| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 2663| [45] ["Yes. So now it's question time: What did I write on that piece of paper?"]
115: 2689| [47] [Miyoko]
116: 2692| [45] ["'Hikoboshi', right?"]
117: 2697| [45] [The professor answered as if it were obvious.]
118: 2702| [45] [But Yuuri smiled impishly and revealed the paper to the professor.]
119: 2710| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 2713| [45] ["Bzzzt, the correct answer was 'Orihime'~"]
121: 2739| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 2742| [45] ["Ah... you're right!"]
123: 2747| [45] [The professor stared fixedly at the word 'Orihime' written on the paper.]
124: 2773| [47] [Miyoko]
125: 2776| [45] ["It feels a little odd now that I've experienced it firsthand."]
126: 2784| [47] [Yuuri]
127: 2787| [45] ["It does, doesn't it~?"]
128: 2792| [45] [As Yuuri and the professor smiled at each other, a sharp voice suddenly bellowed.]
129: 2803| [47] [Eriguchi]
130: 2806| [45] ["What do you think you're doing, Dr. Tenkawa!?"]
131: 2829| [45] [The voice came from the speaker installed in the ceiling of the laboratory.]
132: 2855| [47] [Miyoko]
133: 2858| [45] ["Oh my, looks like we've got someone troublesome on our case..."]
134: 2863| [45] [The laboratory was monitored in a different room via cameras.]
135: 2919| [45] [The professor turned to the camera and answered in irritation.]
136: 2945| [47] [Miyoko]
137: 2948| [45] ["I filed the approval form yesterday to perform memory manipulation experiments today.%NWhat's the problem?"]
138: 2953| [47] [Eriguchi]
139: 2956| [45] ["You never said YOU would be the target!"]
140: 2961| [47] [Eriguchi]
141: 2964| [45] ["I thought we made it clear that AD injection was required during any contact with Subject Y-II!"]
142: 2969| [47] [Eriguchi]
143: 2972| [45] ["Besides, you must be mad to experiment on yourself in the first place! What are you going to do if you permanently damage your brain!?"]
144: 2998| [47] [Miyoko]
145: 3001| [45] ["We've done more than enough animal experiments to prove that it's not dangerous."]
146: 3027| [47] [Miyoko]
147: 3030| [45] ["It's for the sake of advancing research. Please don't fuss over every minor detail."]
148: 3035| [45] [Once Dr. Tenkawa finished speaking, the speakers cut out.]
149: 3040| [45] [But something about that exchange felt strange to Yuuri.]
150: 3045| [45] [--Why was the professor so insistent to perform experiments on herself?]
151: 3053| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 3056| [45] ["Um, Professor... why are you doing this?"]
153: 3107| [47] [Miyoko]
154: 3108| [45] ["..."]
155: 3113| [45] [The professor slowly looked back and spoke to Yuuri.]
156: 3141| [47] [Miyoko]
157: 3144| [45] ["... Actually, you see... There's one thing I'd like to ask of you."]
158: 3152| [47] [Yuuri]
159: 3155| [45] ["Huh?"]
160: 3169| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 3172| [45] ["Right now... Natsuhiko's body is in serious condition. I want you to save him."]
162: 3180| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 3183| [45] ["H-Hikorin's body!? What happened to him!?"]
164: 3209| [47] [Miyoko]
165: 3212| [45] ["It's hard to describe with words. So--"]
166: 3238| [47] [Miyoko]
167: 3241| [45] ["Go back through my memories and see it for yourself."]
168: 3249| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 3252| [45] ["...!"]
170: 3278| [47] [Miyoko]
171: 3281| [45] ["Look through my memories relating to Natsuhiko after the accident... You'll understand his current condition then."]
172: 3289| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 3292| [45] ["O-okay..."]
174: 3352| [45] [Yuuri timidly dove into the professor's memory.]
175: 3517| [45] [--It was a memory of right around three months ago.]
176: 3522| [45] [In it, Natsuhiko was lying in a bed in a hospital room at Rokumei City Hospital.]
177: 3544| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 3545| [45] [(!!)]
179: 3617| [45] [But he wasn't asleep.]
180: 3622| [45] [He was frozen still, his eyes blankly open.]
181: 3627| [45] [Beside him were the professor, as well as Mashiro.]
182: 3706| [47] [Mashiro]
183: 3709| [45] ["... Natsuhiko?"]
184: 3714| [45] [Mashiro called out to Natsuhiko. But there was no response.]
185: 3740| [47] [Mashiro]
186: 3743| [45] ["H-hey! What's wrong, Natsuhiko!?"]
187: 3769| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 3772| [45] ["Can't you hear me!? Hey!"]
189: 3780| [47] [Miyoko]
190: 3783| [45] ["... He can't hear you."]
191: 3809| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 3812| [45] ["Huh?"]
193: 3859| [47] [Miyoko]
194: 3862| [45] ["He's been like that ever since he learned about Yuuri's death..."]
195: 3870| [47] [Miyoko]
196: 3873| [45] ["It's not just you, Mashiro. He won't respond to anyone... not me, nor the doctors."]
197: 3881| [47] [Miyoko]
198: 3884| [45] ["He couldn't come to terms with the truth... and he shut his mind away..."]
199: 3908| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 3909| [45] [(N... no way...!)]
201: 4027| [45] [--Yuuri was still shocked when she returned to reality.]
202: 4035| [47] [Yuuri]
203: 4038| [45] ["... Hikorin..."]
204: 4043| [45] [She couldn't believe that such a cheery and energetic boy like Natsuhiko could end up in that state.]
205: 4069| [47] [Miyoko]
206: 4072| [45] ["... Natsuhiko loved you so much..."]
207: 4080| [47] [Miyoko]
208: 4083| [45] ["It was such a pity to see him like that... even though it was all a lie."]
209: 4091| [47] [Miyoko]
210: 4094| [45] ["I never expected that our lie would shatter his mind..."]
211: 4102| [47] [Yuuri]
212: 4105| [45] ["...!"]
213: 4138| [45] [Yuuri wanted to save Natsuhiko.]
214: 4143| [45] [That was why she sacrificed her freedom in his place.]
215: 4189| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 4190| [45] [(So why... why did this have to happen...!?)]
217: 4195| [45] [That was a question that likely nobody could answer.]
218: 4200| [45] [But even so, Yuuri spoke to the one person she could rely on.]
219: 4257| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 4260| [45] ["I never could've imagined... I never could've imagined this would happen!"]
221: 4268| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 4271| [45] ["What can I do!? What can I do for Hikorin...?"]
223: 4279| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 4282| [45] ["I know! Can't we just tell him that I'm alive!?"]
225: 4290| [47] [Yuuri]
226: 4293| [45] ["I'm sure even Hikorin would--"]
227: 4319| [47] [Miyoko]
228: 4322| [45] ["We can't!"]
229: 4330| [47] [Miyoko]
230: 4333| [45] ["Right now, LABO sees your existence as a top priority secret matter."]
231: 4359| [47] [Miyoko]
232: 4362| [45] ["If Natsuhiko were to learn about your survival, then LABO would surely incarcerate him too."]
233: 4370| [47] [Miyoko]
234: 4373| [45] ["And besides, we have no means to tell him... He's unaware of his surroundings."]
235: 4381| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 4384| [45] ["Then... there's nothing we can do but let Hikorin stay that way?"]
237: 4389| [45] [When Yuuri asked her that question-- the professor shook her head.]
238: 4415| [47] [Miyoko]
239: 4418| [45] ["... No."]
240: 4426| [47] [Miyoko]
241: 4429| [45] ["There is one way."]
242: 4437| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 4440| [45] ["Huh...?"]
244: 4466| [47] [Miyoko]
245: 4469| [45] ["Yuuri. You've been training your BC ability throughout these past three months, correct?"]
246: 4477| [47] [Miyoko]
247: 4480| [45] ["You might be able to save Natsuhiko with that power of yours..."]
248: 4488| [47] [Yuuri]
249: 4491| [45] ["...!?"]
250: 4496| [45] [The professor's words shook Yuuri.]
251: 4504| [47] [Yuuri]
252: 4507| [45] ["Professor... what do you want me to do?"]
253: 4533| [47] [Miyoko]
254: 4536| [45] ["Use your power to dive into Natsuhiko's brain--"]
255: 4562| [47] [Miyoko]
256: 4565| [45] ["And erase all of his memories of you...!"]
257: 4588| [47] [Yuuri]
258: 4591| [45] ["!"]
259: 4596| [45] [That was the professor's plan.]
260: 4601| [45] [Or rather, even if the professor hadn't told her, Yuuri had thought of that method as well.]
261: 4655| [47] [Yuuri]
262: 4656| [45] [(It was his memories of me that made Hikorin turn out that way...)]
263: 4661| [47] [Yuuri]
264: 4662| [45] [(So to set Hikorin free...!)]
265: 4677| [45] [Soon enough, Yuuri answered in a faint voice.]
266: 4682| [47] [Yuuri]
267: 4683| [45] ["..."]
268: 4691| [47] [Yuuri]
269: 4694| [45] ["As long as it will return Hikorin to normal..."]
