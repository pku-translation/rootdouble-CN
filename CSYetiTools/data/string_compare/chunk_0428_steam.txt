  0:   53| [45] [The day of reckoning had finally arrived.]
  1:  105| [45] [September 16, 5:30 AM--]
  2:  110| [45] [Once Ukita confirmed that the hallway he was observing was unpopulated, he sprang into action.]
  3:  195| [45] [He opened the door to find that the security guards on standby--]
  4:  200| [47] [Security Guard 1]
  5:  203| [45] ["Zzz, zzz, zzz, zzz..."]
  6:  208| [47] [Security Guard 2]
  7:  211| [45] ["Kahshhhhhh, kahshhhhhhh..."]
  8:  216| [45] [--were all out cold in a deep sleep.]
  9:  221| [45] [This had all been due to the powerful sleeping agent Ukita had mixed into their coffee half an hour ago.]
 10:  226| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  227| [45] [(Looks like losing all those games of chess was worth it after all...)]
 12:  232| [45] [Ukita allowed himself a small chuckle at that, then went to the engine room to bring the sprinkler system offline.]
 13:  282| [45] [Then at 6:19 AM--]
 14:  336| [45] [Ukita returned to the surveillance room, then immediately checked the monitors to confirm no one was in Area 1's inner ring.]
 15:  344| [47] [Ukita]
 16:  347| [45] ["... Okay then, let's begin."]
 17:  358| [45] [He muttered that to persuade himself, then turned on the PA to Area 1's inner ring.]
 18:  363| [45] [Next, he took out his PDA and played the immediate detonation sound file.]
 19:  368| [45] [The ultrasonic waves then played over the PA--]
 20:  394| [45] [The explosions and shockwaves from Area 1's inner ring faintly reached the surveillance room.]
 21:  399| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  400| [45] [(Next order of business is Areas 2 and 3...)]
 23:  405| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  406| [45] [(Okay, no one's around the bombs-- now!)]
 25:  447| [45] [He then detonated the bombs one after another, causing LABO's automatic PA to start broadcasting.]
 26:  458| [47] [Automatic PA]
 27:  461| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 28:  487| [47] [Automatic PA]
 29:  490| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B2 Area 3."]
 30:  516| [47] [Automatic PA]
 31:  519| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 5."]
 32:  545| [47] [Automatic PA]
 33:  548| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 34:  574| [47] [Automatic PA]
 35:  577| [45] ["All personnel, please calmly evacuate to the surface levels."]
 36:  603| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  604| [45] [(Perfect! The warning system is active! It should be sending a dispatch request to Sirius right about now!)]
 38:  609| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  610| [45] [(--I have to evacuate the rest of the staff while they're on their way here!)]
 40:  615| [45] [Ukita adopted a tone of desperation as he spoke into the facility's PA.]
 41:  623| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  626| [45] ["Th-this is an emergency broadcast!"]
 43:  634| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  637| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have just occurred within the facility!"]
 45:  645| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  648| [45] ["From our current understanding of the situation, explosions occurred simultaneously in ten different locations inside the facility. Fires have broken out as a result!"]
 47:  656| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  659| [45] ["Researchers Eriguchi and Kashiwagi! Please come to Area 2 posthaste!"]
 49:  667| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  670| [45] ["I wish to consult the two of you about taking out top secret data!"]
 51:  675| [45] [--With the pieces for the plan now all in place, he stopped broadcasting for the time being.]
 52:  680| [45] [By then, a great clamor of people desperately running for their lives had already begun, even right outside the surveillance room.]
 53:  738| [45] [Ukita opened the door and looked outside, then called to some nearby staffers.]
 54:  746| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  749| [45] ["Please help! The security guards in here are unconscious! Take them outside!"]
 56:  754| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 57:  757| [45] ["O-okay. But what about you?"]
 58:  765| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  768| [45] ["I'll stay here and lead the evacuation! Don't worry about me and just get out of here!"]
 60:  773| [45] [Ukita then ran on over to the control room.]
 61:  830| [45] [There were still many researchers in there.]
 62:  835| [45] [Ukita had learned a while back that they were using the WX particle amplifier this morning to conduct some sort of experiment.]
 63:  840| [45] [He shouted at the group of people there still manning their posts.]
 64:  848| [47] [Ukita]
 65:  851| [45] ["What are you people doing!? Hurry up and get out of here!"]
 66:  856| [47] [Researcher 1]
 67:  859| [45] ["But the amplifier is still online--"]
 68:  867| [47] [Ukita]
 69:  870| [45] ["Brain Cell will automatically take care of shutting it off if you leave it alone, right!?"]
 70:  878| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  881| [45] ["And even in the event that fails, you can still turn it off from the remote control room on the surface level!"]
 72:  889| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  892| [45] ["Just hurry up and get out of here! If you die, it'll all be for nothing!"]
 74:  897| [47] [Researcher 2]
 75:  900| [45] ["--R-right!"]
 76:  906| [45] [And with that shout, the researchers all scrambled out of the room.]
 77:  911| [47] [Ukita]
 78:  912| [45] [(Good, now's my chance--!)]
 79:  918| [45] [Now that he had cleared the room of people, Ukita walked up to Brain Cell's control panel.]
 80:  923| [45] [He checked the monitor to find that the WX particle amplifier was apparently maintaining a steady output of "500 mSv".]
 81:  928| [45] [If left on its own, those levels would automatically decrease.]
 82:  939| [45] [But Ukita swiftly operated the control panel and rose its output to maximum.]
 83:  945| [45] [--The particle readings then gradually began to rise.]
 84:  950| [45] ["501 mSv", "502 mSv", "504 mSv"...!]
 85:  955| [47] [Ukita]
 86:  956| [45] [(... Good, this should soon render the amplifier out of control!)]
 87:  961| [45] [It truly was a device that required the utmost attention to operate. It easily went haywire when the output was intentionally set to maximum.]
 88:  966| [47] [Ukita]
 89:  967| [45] [(It's do or die from here on out!)]
 90:  972| [45] [Ukita ran out of the control room.]
 91: 1025| [45] [He then returned to the surveillance room to find that the security guards were gone.]
 92: 1030| [45] [All that remained was a security card someone had dropped.]
 93: 1035| [45] [Ukita picked it up and continued his acts of destruction as he made further broadcasts.]
 94: 1087| [45] [The clamor soon grew faint, and eventually, he could no longer spot anyone on the monitors.]
 95: 1098| [45] [Ukita quickly picked up the receiver of the ringing extension phone.]
 96: 1112| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1115| [45] ["Hello, this is the surveillance room."]
 98: 1120| [47] [Security Guard]
 99: 1123| [45] ["Oh... so someone's still there!?"]
100: 1128| [47] [Security Guard]
101: 1131| [45] ["This is the surface floor surveillance room. I hate to cut to the chase, but who are you?"]
102: 1136| [47] [Security Guard]
103: 1139| [45] ["According to the roll call, three staff members are still in the basement: Eriguchi, Kashiwagi, and Ukita--"]
104: 1147| [47] [Ukita]
105: 1150| [45] ["Understood! I will find those two posthaste and have them evacuate!"]
106: 1155| [45] [Ukita shouted that, then hung up the phone.]
107: 1166| [45] ["Eriguchi" and "Kashiwagi" were the two researchers Ukita had summoned over the PA earlier.]
108: 1171| [45] [According to the listing he checked beforehand, both of them had the authority to enter Area Zero.]
109: 1176| [45] [It was likely that Watase and his coworkers had already arrived and caught them at this point.]
110: 1181| [45] [Once Ukita had determined that, he turned back to the PA's mic and spoke.]
111: 1189| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1192| [45] ["According to the roll-call on the ground floor, evacuation of all staff members has been confirmed!"]
113: 1200| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1203| [45] ["In the unlikely event that anyone besides staff members has been left behind, please escape through Areas 5 and 6 immediately!"]
115: 1208| [45] [He made that broadcast as a sign for Watase and his coworkers just to be safe.]
116: 1256| [45] [But he wouldn't waste time waiting for them to arrive.]
117: 1313| [45] [He went on over to the control room and checked on the current status of the amplifier.]
118: 1318| [45] [The levels in Area N were at "2315 mSv". The value was rising at a good pace.]
119: 1323| [45] [Brain Cell had begun efforts to perform an emergency shutdown on the amplifier, but it was too late.]
120: 1328| [45] [The monitor showed that the shutdown and the dampening of the particles were scheduled to finish at "18:16".]
121: 1333| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1334| [45] [(About 11 hours left to go! Good, everything's gone perfectly up to this point!)]
123: 1339| [45] [And when he went back to the surveillance room--]
124: 1399| [45] [Watase and his coworkers quickly showed up, carrying the unconscious high ranked researchers with them.]
125: 1432| [47] [Watase]
126: 1435| [45] ["We'll head on down to Area Zero and rescue the test subjects."]
127: 1443| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1446| [45] ["I'll stay here and keep an eye out to make sure nothing unexpected happens."]
129: 1451| [45] [Watase nodded, then proceeded to run out of the room with Dojima and Hiyama.]
130: 1525| [45] [But then they didn't come back when expected.]
131: 1530| [45] [A Case N hadn't been declared yet, either.]
132: 1535| [47] [Ukita]
133: 1536| [45] [(They're taking too long...! What's keeping them!?)]
134: 1541| [47] [Ukita]
135: 1542| [45] [(I thought I made it clear to them they'd be in real danger once the particle levels exceeded 4000 mSv!)]
136: 1547| [45] [But his thoughts were immediately interrupted by the sudden nigh-deafening ringing of a siren.]
137: 1569| [47] [Automatic PA]
138: 1572| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
139: 1577| [47] [Automatic PA]
140: 1580| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
141: 1585| [47] [Automatic PA]
142: 1588| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
143: 1593| [45] [Ukita checked the time in surprise to find that Watase and his coworkers were 20 minutes behind schedule.]
144: 1598| [47] [Ukita]
145: 1599| [45] [(Did... did they make it in time?)]
146: 1604| [45] [Ukita detonated the rest of the bombs while thinking that he'd check Watase and his coworkers afterwards to see if they were okay.]
147: 1671| [45] [Some of the bombs failed to detonate, but he had expected a few duds.]
148: 1676| [45] [And right as Ukita administered the AD he had prepared beforehand, Watase and his coworkers returned.]
149: 1715| [47] [Ukita]
150: 1718| [45] ["You're late! Did something happen to you three!?"]
151: 1726| [47] [Watase]
152: 1729| [45] ["N-no... we're okay for now, but..."]
153: 1737| [47] [Ukita]
154: 1740| [45] ["Really...?"]
155: 1745| [45] [Watase replied to Ukita's concerned question with distaste.]
156: 1773| [47] [Watase]
157: 1776| [45] ["I said we're okay, didn't I? More importantly--"]
158: 1802| [47] [Watase]
159: 1805| [45] ["We're in big trouble! There was only one test subject in Area Zero!"]
160: 1813| [47] [Ukita]
161: 1816| [45] ["What!?"]
162: 1827| [45] [Watase then proceeded to explain the situation.]
163: 1832| [45] [Subject Y-II was nowhere to be found.]
164: 1837| [45] [Ukita then realized the two high-ranked researchers were missing. He asked about their fates-- and was met with an unbelievable answer.]
165: 1842| [47] [Ukita]
166: 1843| [45] [(The rescue workers killed them in Area Zero!?)]
167: 1850| [45] [Ukita started flaring up at Watase before he even knew what he was doing.]
168: 1910| [47] [Ukita]
169: 1913| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, this isn't what you promised!"]
170: 1921| [47] [Ukita]
171: 1924| [45] ["You told me there'd be no casualties, remember!?"]
172: 1950| [47] [Watase]
173: 1953| [45] ["H-hold on! Calm down, Mr. Ukita!"]
174: 1961| [47] [Ukita]
175: 1964| [45] ["You said you wouldn't hurt anyone, right!? Was that a lie!?"]
176: 1972| [47] [Ukita]
177: 1975| [45] ["If you're saying it was, then the three of you must--"]
178: 1998| [45] [Ukita instinctively tried to grab Watase, but at that moment--]
179: 2056| [47] [Ukita]
180: 2059| [45] ["!"]
181: 2064| [45] [He was struck in the back of the head.]
182: 2079| [47] [Ukita]
183: 2082| [45] ["Wh... y...?"]
184: 2087| [45] [He could still make out Watase's voice as his consciousness faded.]
185: 2156| [47] [Watase]
186: 2159| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Mr. Ukita."]
187: 2167| [47] [Watase]
188: 2170| [45] ["It's too late... for us to turn back."]
189: 2175| [45] [Watase had said "us".]
190: 2182| [45] [But it didn't seem like he was including Ukita when he said that.]
191: 2187| [47] [Ukita]
192: 2188| [45] [(Have I... been betrayed...?)]
193: 2193| [45] [Ukita lost consciousness as if he were drowning in a sea of his own dismay.]
194: 2208| [45] [------]
195: 2213| [45] [...]
196: 2218| [45] [... He had no idea how long he'd been out for.]
197: 2226| [47] [Ukita]
198: 2229| [45] ["U... ugh..."]
199: 2255| [47] [Ukita]
200: 2258| [45] ["What happened to me...?"]
201: 2266| [47] [Ukita]
202: 2269| [45] ["Th-that's right... Captain Kasasagi knocked me out..."]
203: 2323| [45] [When he came to his senses, he realized that the security card around his neck and the one he had in his pocket were both gone.]
204: 2338| [47] [Ukita]
205: 2339| [45] [(Where did they go...!?)]
206: 2345| [45] [Ukita proceeded to check the surveillance monitors to get a grasp of the current situation.]
207: 2350| [45] [But most of the cameras had been damaged as a result of the explosions, so they weren't very helpful.]
208: 2355| [47] [Ukita]
209: 2356| [45] [(Dammit, where the hell did they all go!? Did they leave me behind!?)]
210: 2361| [47] [Ukita]
211: 2362| [45] [(It can't be... Were they planning on making me their scapegoat from the very start!?)]
212: 2367| [45] [Ukita's heart still harbored the desire to trust in Watase.]
213: 2372| [45] [But the fact that Watase's team had killed two men and knocked him unconscious created a powerful sense of ambivalence in him.]
214: 2380| [47] [Ukita]
215: 2383| [45] ["... F-forget that... First I just need to do whatever I can for now...!"]
216: 2388| [45] [He had to erase all evidence that he had participated in this attack in the chance he was caught.]
217: 2399| [45] [It was with that thought that he began deleting the security footage--]
218: 2449| [45] [--But a short while later, he discovered some most stunning footage.]
219: 2511| [47] [Ukita]
220: 2514| [45] ["Th-this is...!"]
221: 2519| [45] [Ukita frantically paused the video.]
222: 2537| [47] [Ukita]
223: 2540| [45] ["This is... impossible...! Why were they...?"]
224: 2545| [45] [Natsuhiko and his friends were right there in the security footage!]
225: 2550| [45] [The image was a bit fuzzy as a result of the explosions, but there was no doubt as to who those three were.]
226: 2555| [45] [Ukita felt his pulse skyrocket in shock.]
227: 2560| [47] [Ukita]
228: 2561| [45] [(I-it can't be... Did they go directly to LABO after last night!?)]
229: 2566| [47] [Ukita]
230: 2567| [45] [(Meaning they got caught up in our terrorist attack--!)]
231: 2574| [45] [Ukita had set off the bombs a few hours ago in places where people weren't around.]
232: 2579| [45] [But he'd been so busy that he hadn't even checked the monitors thoroughly enough to see who was on them.]
233: 2584| [45] [It was for that reason he hadn't noticed Natsuhiko and his friends.]
234: 2589| [47] [Ukita]
235: 2590| [45] [(This is bad... this is bad, this is bad!)]
236: 2595| [47] [Ukita]
237: 2596| [45] [(If they weren't able to get out of here, then it's all my fault! No question about it!)]
238: 2601| [45] [--But just as Ukita thought that...]
239: 2606| [45] [He heard voices from outside.]
240: 2661| [47] [???]
241: 2664| [45] ["Heeey! Is someone in there!?"]
242: 2674| [47] [Ukita]
243: 2677| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
244: 2685| [47] [Ukita]
245: 2688| [45] ["That voice-- is that you, Captain Kasasagi!?"]
246: 2696| [47] [Watase]
247: 2699| [45] ["What!? Y-you know who I am!?"]
248: 2707| [47] [Ukita]
249: 2710| [45] ["H-how could I -not- know you..."]
250: 2748| [45] [He opened the door to find none other than Watase standing there.]
251: 2753| [45] [But it wasn't just him-- accompanying him were two rescue workers and two other women Ukita had never seen before.]
252: 2779| [47] [Ena]
253: 2782| [45] ["I'm Ena Tsubakiyama. I'm a high school teacher who was called to this facility."]
254: 2808| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 2811| [45] ["I'm Yuuri... I'm family to one of LABO's researchers."]
256: 2816| [45] [Ukita looked at their presence with suspicious eyes.]
257: 2821| [47] [Ukita]
258: 2822| [45] [(... Something is not right here. No matter the circumstances, only staff members are supposed to be allowed in LABO. Everyone else is forbidden.)]
259: 2827| [47] [Ukita]
260: 2828| [45] [(No, but more importantly, that "Yuuri" girl... Could she be Subject Y-II!?)]
261: 2927| [45] [But the one Ukita was most confused about was Watase.]
262: 2932| [45] [He had apparently gotten some form of memory impairment and couldn't even remember Ukita.]
263: 2937| [47] [Ukita]
264: 2938| [45] [(What in the world is going on!? Is it a lie he cooked up on the spot when he came across his other subordinates that weren't supposed to be down here!?)]
265: 2943| [47] [Ukita]
266: 2944| [45] [(But even if that is the case, then what happened to Dojima and Hiyama!? What about Subject N!? Where did they all go!?)]
267: 2949| [45] [Ukita was confused by the series of unexpected events--]
268: 3003| [45] [But when he saw Subject Y-II in front of him...]
269: 3053| [45] [... and remembered that Natsuhiko and his friends could still be trapped down in the basement--]
270: 3092| [45] [--Ukita regained his composure.]
271: 3097| [47] [Ukita]
272: 3098| [45] [(That's right, I must calm down and remember why everything I did today was necessary.)]
273: 3103| [45] [He didn't know what was going on. Perhaps Watase and his coworkers had betrayed him.]
274: 3108| [45] [But all of Ukita's actions on that day were for the sake of saving the test subjects and Natsuhiko.]
275: 3113| [47] [Ukita]
