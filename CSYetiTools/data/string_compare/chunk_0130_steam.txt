  1:  374| [86] [You have taken from me my closest friends]
  2:  375| [86] [and have made me repulsive to them.]
  3:  376| [86] [I am confined and cannot escape.]
  4:  377| [86] [(The Old Testament / Psalms 88:8)]
  5:  379| [45] [--The roar echoed through the laboratory at daybreak--]
  6:  384| [45] [As if it were a bell heralding the end.]
  7:  501| [47] [Boy]
  8:  504| [45] ["Wha!?"]
  9:  509| [45] [The boy gasped in shock.]
 10:  599| [47] [Girl 1]
 11:  602| [45] ["Kyaah!"]
 12:  607| [45] [The girls screamed beside him.]
 13:  648| [47] [Girl 2]
 14:  651| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
 15:  656| [45] [They felt the tremors through the floor.]
 16:  842| [47] [Girl 2]
 17:  845| [45] ["... Explosions? Several of them...!?"]
 18:  853| [47] [Girl 1]
 19:  856| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko, could this be...!?"]
 20:  933| [45] [The boy called "Natsuhiko" gritted his teeth at the girls' words.]
 21:  959| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  962| [45] ["Yeah, it is..."]
 23:  977| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  980| [45] ["... We didn't make it in time."]
 25:  985| [45] [His words were drowned out by the shrill shriek of an alarm.]
 26: 2220| [45] [A calm automated voice read out an announcement.]
 27: 2225| [47] [Automatic PA]
 28: 2228| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 29: 2233| [47] [Automatic PA]
 30: 2236| [45] ["All personnel, please calmly evacuate to the surface levels."]
 31: 2357| [45] [Everyone seemed to be confused by the fragmentary information.]
 32: 2362| [47] [Researcher 1]
 33: 2365| [45] ["W-what happened!?"]
 34: 2370| [47] [Researcher 2]
 35: 2373| [45] ["I don't know! Were those explosions...?"]
 36: 2378| [47] [Researcher 3]
 37: 2381| [45] ["Explosions!? In -this- facility!?"]
 38: 2386| [45] [The announcement continued as if to answer that question.]
 39: 2483| [47] [Male Staff]
 40: 2486| [45] ["Th-this is an emergency broadcast!"]
 41: 2494| [47] [Male Staff]
 42: 2497| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have just occurred within the facility!"]
 43: 2505| [47] [Male Staff]
 44: 2508| [45] ["From our current understanding of the situation, explosions occurred simultaneously in ten different locations inside the facility. Fires have broken out as a result!"]
 45: 2516| [47] [Male Staff]
 46: 2519| [45] ["Researchers Eriguchi and Kashiwagi! Please come to Area 2 posthaste!"]
 47: 2609| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 48: 2612| [45] ["Explosions in ten different locations...!?"]
 49: 2617| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 50: 2620| [45] ["'Unknown origin'!? What do you mean, 'unknown origin'!?"]
 51: 2625| [45] [As the men shuddered, a female scientist muttered.]
 52: 2711| [47] [Female Researcher]
 53: 2714| [45] ["It's okay...! This facility's equipped with layers upon layers of disaster prevention systems."]
 54: 2722| [47] [Female Researcher]
 55: 2725| [45] ["No matter what happens, it shouldn't escalate to a large-scale disaster."]
 56: 2751| [47] [Female Researcher]
 57: 2754| [45] ["Our safety is guaranteed... so there's no need to worry."]
 58: 2759| [45] [She spoke softly and gently to quell their fears with hope.]
 59: 2877| [45] [--But that hope was trampled soon enough.]
 60: 2963| [47] [Security Guard 1]
 61: 2966| [45] ["The sprinkler system's not working!?"]
 62: 2971| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 63: 2974| [45] ["Why...? Dammit! Hurry up with the personnel evacuation!"]
 64: 2979| [45] [The systems that were supposedly their last ray of hope proved to be completely ineffective.]
 65: 3059| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 66: 3062| [45] ["They've even confirmed fires in the factory! The equipment undergoing development's going up in flames now!"]
 67: 3067| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 68: 3070| [45] ["You've gotta be kidding me! Do you even realize how much it cost to develop that!?"]
 69: 3075| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 70: 3078| [45] ["We can't let it go up in flames! Put it out manually!"]
 71: 3083| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 72: 3086| [45] ["There's another fire breaking out in in Hall 4! Who can extinguish the flames if nobody can even reach the factory?"]
 73: 3202| [45] [Chaos and hysteria dominated the facility.]
 74: 3207| [45] [Anxiety began to spread.]
 75: 3212| [45] [And, as if to top it all off, a new announcement rang out.]
 76: 3308| [47] [Male Staff]
 77: 3311| [45] ["Heightened readings confirmed in Area N...! Emergency shutdown system has been initiated!"]
 78: 3319| [47] [Male Staff]
 79: 3322| [45] ["All personnel, including those in the Area N control room, please evacuate to the surface levels immediately!"]
 80: 3400| [45] [--The moment the announcement ended, the silence shifted to sheer panic.]
 81: 3405| [47] [Researcher 1]
 82: 3408| [45] ["H... heightened readings!?"]
 83: 3413| [47] [Researcher 3]
 84: 3416| [45] ["L-let's just go to the surface level for now! To the remote control room!"]
 85: 3421| [47] [Researcher 2]
 86: 3424| [45] ["This elevator's no good! Use the stairs! The stairs!"]
 87: 3429| [45] [Everyone shouted their lungs out.]
 88: 3507| [47] [Researcher 1]
 89: 3510| [45] ["Administer AD! We've got emergency stockpiles of it, don't we!?"]
 90: 3515| [47] [Researcher 2]
 91: 3518| [45] ["I never thought we'd actually need to use it...!"]
 92: 3523| [47] [Researcher 1]
 93: 3526| [45] ["Don't panic! Just follow the manual!"]
 94: 3531| [45] [They did their best to adapt to the situation.]
 95: 3536| [45] [But it was all too late by then.]
 96: 3614| [47] [Researcher 1]
 97: 3617| [45] ["The emergency staircases have collapsed!?"]
 98: 3622| [47] [Researcher 2]
 99: 3625| [45] ["All the elevators are offline too! There's no way out!"]
100: 3630| [47] [Researcher 3]
101: 3633| [45] ["Impossible... How did this happen!?"]
102: 3679| [45] [Their escape routes were cut off.]
103: 3684| [45] [And they had no way of knowing why.]
104: 3689| [45] [Nobody understood what was going on.]
105: 3700| [45] [--Nobody, with a few exceptions, that is.]
106: 3799| [45] [Natsuhiko and the girls stared at the collapsed staircase in exasperation.]
107: 3807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 3810| [45] ["--Dammit! This is all their doing!"]
109: 3818| [47] [Salyu]
110: 3821| [45] ["How could the situation have gotten this bad...?"]
111: 3938| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 3941| [45] ["What do we do, Natsuhiko!?"]
113: 3946| [45] [The girl beside him grieved.]
114: 3969| [45] [Just how much time did they have left?]
115: 3974| [45] [As he pondered that question, the boy looked at his watch.%NBut to his dismay--]
116: 4207| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 4210| [45] ["Ah..."]
118: 4215| [45] [--one of the explosions had broken it.]
119: 4220| [45] [The watch's date had stopped at 9/16. Its hands at 6:19.]
120: 4225| [45] [A time he'd likely never forget for the rest of his life.]
121: 4293| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 4294| [45] [(If only we had gotten here just a little bit sooner...!)]
123: 4317| [45] [But even if they were late, there was still meaning in their arrival.]
124: 4430| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to walk off, but the girl grabbed him by the hand.]
125: 4438| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 4441| [45] ["Hold it, Natsuhiko! Where do you think you're going in a crisis like this!?"]
127: 4449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 4452| [45] ["I'm gonna find those bastards...!"]
129: 4478| [47] [Salyu]
130: 4481| [45] ["--Wait, Natsuhiko, you don't mean!?"]
131: 4489| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 4492| [45] ["... I'm gonna put an end to their plan. I can still do something--"]
133: 4533| [47] [Mashiro]
134: 4536| [45] ["No, you can't! Natsuhiko, calm down!"]
135: 4544| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 4547| [45] ["Why!? You agreed that we should come here, didn't you, Mashiro!?"]
137: 4573| [47] [Mashiro]
138: 4576| [45] ["The situation's completely changed! It's too late now!"]
139: 4584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 4587| [45] ["It's never too late! I'm sure I can still make it!"]
141: 4613| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 4616| [45] ["Besides, even if we do run, it's not gonna change anything! So in that case--"]
143: 4735| [45] [The moment those words left his lips, a sharp pain ran through his cheek.]
144: 4740| [45] [The girl had slapped him.]
145: 4766| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 4769| [45] ["...!"]
147: 4777| [47] [Mashiro]
148: 4780| [45] ["Do you want to suffer another loss that badly...!?"]
149: 4803| [45] [Those words gouged out his heart.]
150: 4907| [45] [--And then, another roar rang out.]
151: 4933| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 4936| [45] ["!?"]
153: 4962| [47] [Salyu]
154: 4965| [45] ["Another explosion... where...?"]
155: 4991| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 4994| [45] ["Please, Natsuhiko. Let's get out of here already!"]
157: 5017| [45] [The girl's pleading voice shook Natsuhiko's heart.]
158: 5022| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 5023| [45] ["..."]
160: 5046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 5047| [45] ["..."]
162: 5052| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 5053| [45] ["..."]
164: 5079| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 5082| [45] ["... Okay. Let's look for a way out of here first...!"]
166: 5282| [45] [--And thus, they ran, looking for an exit.]
167: 5287| [45] [Without knowing what laid ahead of them.]
168: 5292| [45] [And thus, the long day that they'd later look back to time and time again--]
169: 5297| [45] [had begun.]
170: 5422| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 5425| [45] ["Let's look for another staircase! There has to be a safe one somewhere!"]
172: 5451| [47] [Mashiro]
173: 5454| [45] ["Do you know the layout of the facility!?"]
174: 5480| [47] [Salyu]
175: 5483| [45] ["We should look into that first. It's dangerous to run blindly without an escape plan."]
176: 5868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 5871| [45] ["Salyu, what are you doing!?"]
178: 5964| [47] [Salyu]
179: 5967| [45] ["I'm looking up a map of the facility."]
180: 6182| [47] [Salyu]
181: 6185| [45] ["I think that last broken staircase we saw was the outer ring emergency staircase."]
182: 6236| [47] [Mashiro]
183: 6239| [45] ["Looks like there's an inner ring emergency staircase nearby too, huh..."]
184: 6374| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 6377| [45] ["Okay, so let's head there first!"]
186: 6701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 6704| [45] ["Fire!? How'd a fire break out here so fast!?"]
188: 6712| [47] [Mashiro]
189: 6715| [45] ["Don't tell me it was set here to prevent the people from escaping the facility...?"]
190: 6741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 6744| [45] ["Gh... it's too dangerous here! Let's look for another path!"]
192: 6876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 6879| [45] ["I'll go check if the path to Area 2 is safe!"]
194: 6905| [47] [Salyu]
195: 6908| [45] ["Roger. Be careful!"]
196: 7043| [45] [--They ran with all the courage they could muster.]
197: 7112| [45] [To escape from the facility and survive.]
198: 7187| [45] [But in the midst of their path--]
199: 7276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 7279| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
201: 7363| [45] [--He ran into her.]
202: 7584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 7587| [45] ["--Yuuri!?"]
204: 7592| [45] [There stood "Yuuri".]
205: 7695| [45] [The girl who lived in Natsuhiko's home.%NThe girl who was supposed to be waiting for them at home.]
206: 7790| [45] [The girl who shouldn't have been here--]
207: 7874| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 7875| [45] [(What's Yuuri doing...!?)]
209: 7880| [45] [Natsuhiko gazed at her in astonishment.]
210: 7964| [45] [Yuuri--]
211: 7990| [47] [Yuuri]
212: 7993| [45] ["Why did you come here...!?"]
213: 7998| [45] [--sadly muttered this.]
214: 8085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
215: 8088| [45] ["What about you, Yuuri!? Why are -you- here!?"]
216: 8096| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 8099| [45] ["You left home!?"]
218: 8104| [45] [As he asked this question, Natsuhiko thought back...]
219: 8127| [45] [... and recalled the journey that brought him here.]
220: 8211| [45] [Eventually, Yuuri spoke in a lonely voice.]
221: 8237| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 8240| [45] ["... So that's what happened..."]
223: 8245| [45] [And smiled as if a weight had been taken off her shoulders.]
224: 8250| [45] [--At that moment...]
225: 8329| [45] [A flash flickered right beside them.]
226: 8451| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 8454| [45] ["!! Yuuri!"]
228: 8750| [45] [Natsuhiko swiftly lunged at Yuuri. And not a second later, a shockwave struck them.]
229: 8758| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 8761| [45] ["Ah!!"]
231: 8766| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri were blown away.]
232: 8812| [45] [In the split second before they hit the ground--]
233: 8817| [45] [The events that led up to today flashed before Natsuhiko's eyes.]
234: 8891| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 8892| [45] [(How did this happen?)]
236: 8963| [47] [The answer lied in his memories.]
237: 9022| [47] [It all began that fateful day.]
238: 9081| [47] [Six days ago.]
239: 9140| [47] [September 10, 2030.]
240: 9199| [47] [Back before anybody had even expected things would turn out this way.]
241: 9258| [47] [Back when everything was still peaceful--]
242: 9296| [45] [--Eventually, in the deep depths of his fading consciousness--]
243: 9365| [45] ["Awake", a voice called to him.]
244: 9370| [45] [Or perhaps it was merely a memory of such a voice.]
245: 9375| [45] [He heard that voice as he lay beneath the whitewashed tomb...]
246: 9584| [47] [And then time began to move.]
