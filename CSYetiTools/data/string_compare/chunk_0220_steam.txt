  0:   55| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 7]
  1:   63| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   66| [45] ["Wha!?"]
  3:   89| [45] [Natsuhiko fell to the ground as if a rug had been pulled from under him.]
  4:  102| [45] [He heard something shatter by his wrist.]
  5:  107| [45] [But the roaring sounds kept coming.]
  6:  273| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  276| [45] ["Kyaah!"]
  8:  281| [45] [Mashiro screamed from beside him.]
  9:  446| [47] [Salyu]
 10:  449| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
 11:  454| [45] [They could feel tremors coming through from the floor.]
 12:  626| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 13:  629| [45] ["Wh... what was that sound?"]
 14:  634| [45] [The security guard muttered in shock.]
 15:  639| [45] [The kids were well aware of what it was.]
 16:  683| [47] [Salyu]
 17:  686| [45] ["... Explosions? Several of them...!?"]
 18:  694| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  697| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko, could this be...!?"]
 20:  702| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth at those words.]
 21:  710| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  713| [45] ["Yeah, it is..."]
 23:  718| [45] [He endured the pain to stand up and wring words out of his lungs.]
 24:  726| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  729| [45] ["... We didn't make it in time."]
 26:  734| [45] [His words were drowned out by the shrill shriek of an alarm.]
 27:  750| [47] [Automatic PA]
 28:  753| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B1 Area 1."]
 29:  758| [47] [Automatic PA]
 30:  761| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 3."]
 31:  766| [47] [Automatic PA]
 32:  769| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 33:  774| [47] [Automatic PA]
 34:  777| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 2."]
 35:  782| [45] [The automatic disaster prevention system rang out a flurry of warning broadcasts.]
 36:  787| [45] [A mechanical, robotic voice. An unending stream of fragmentary information.]
 37:  792| [45] [But regardless, everyone could tell that an unprecedented crisis was upon this facility.]
 38:  797| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  798| [45] [(--It's the same as nine years ago!)]
 40:  803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  804| [45] [(This same alarm, these same warnings rang out back then too--!)]
 42:  809| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko made that realization, another memory came back.]
 43:  919| [47] [Automatic PA]
 44:  922| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 45:  927| [47] [Automatic PA]
 46:  930| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B2 Area 3."]
 47:  935| [47] [Automatic PA]
 48:  938| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 5."]
 49:  943| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri heard those warnings as they stood in front of the iron door.]
 50:  951| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  954| [45] ["Wh-what!? What happened!?"]
 52: 1017| [47] [Yuuri]
 53: 1020| [45] ["A fire...! Oh no, there's a fire down below!"]
 54: 1028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1031| [45] ["A fire down below!?"]
 56: 1036| [45] [As Natsuhiko yelled, the automatic announcement continued.]
 57: 1041| [47] [Automatic PA]
 58: 1044| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 59: 1049| [47] [Automatic PA]
 60: 1052| [45] ["All personnel, please calmly evacuate to the surface levels."]
 61: 1154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1155| [45] [(--So that's it!)]
 63: 1160| [45] [Back then, it was just a fire alarm, but the situation was similar.]
 64: 1165| [45] [Once Natsuhiko made the connection, he heard the same announcement as he did nine years ago.]
 65: 1170| [47] [Automatic PA]
 66: 1173| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 67: 1178| [47] [Automatic PA]
 68: 1181| [45] ["All personnel, please calmly evacuate to the surface levels."]
 69: 1186| [45] [And at the same time, the iron door opened up further down the entrance.]
 70: 1313| [45] [--And in the same way, the iron door opened up nine years ago.]
 71: 1321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1324| [45] ["A fire down below...? But Mom's down there...!"]
 73: 1350| [47] [Yuuri]
 74: 1353| [45] ["Wh-what do we do, Hikorin...!?"]
 75: 1361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1364| [45] ["I... I gotta go save her!"]
 77: 1372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1375| [45] ["Wait right here, Yuuri!"]
 79: 1380| [45] [Natsuhiko yelled that command as he rushed through to the other side of the door.]
 80: 1492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1495| [45] ["I gotta go... Or else things will take a turn for the worse!"]
 82: 1500| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to run off, but the security guard grabbed his arm.]
 83: 1505| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 84: 1508| [45] ["Hold on a second, kid! Whaddaya mean for the worse!?"]
 85: 1516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1519| [45] ["Officer, this isn't the time for you to mind us!"]
 87: 1524| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 88: 1527| [45] ["What!?"]
 89: 1535| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1538| [45] ["This is a terrorist attack! Call the police and the fire department immediately!"]
 91: 1543| [47] [Security Guard 2]
 92: 1546| [45] ["T-terrorist attack!? No way--...!?"]
 93: 1602| [45] [Natsuhiko shook off the confused security guard's arm and dashed off.]
 94: 1607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1608| [45] [(The terrorists had the sleeper agent cause a commotion in the facility so that the gates would open!)]
 96: 1613| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1614| [45] [(At this rate, it's just a repeat of what happened nine years ago-- No, something far worse!)]
 98: 1647| [47] [Mashiro]
 99: 1650| [45] ["Wait, Natsuhiko, where are you going!?"]
100: 1658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1661| [45] ["To the basement!"]
102: 1694| [47] [Salyu]
103: 1697| [45] ["The basement? But the explosions--"]
104: 1705| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1708| [45] ["You two stay here. No matter what happens, don't you dare move from this spot!!"]
106: 1773| [45] [Saying just that much, Natsuhiko plunged toward the iron door.]
107: 1889| [45] [He searched for a nearby staircase and ran down.]
108: 1993| [45] [As he descended the staircase, he heard the screams of LABO staff members off in the distance.]
109: 1998| [47] [Researcher 1]
110: 2001| [45] ["W-what happened!?"]
111: 2006| [47] [Researcher 2]
112: 2009| [45] ["I don't know! Were those explosions...?"]
113: 2014| [47] [Researcher 3]
114: 2017| [45] ["Explosions!? In -this- facility!?"]
115: 2022| [45] [The basement floors were already engulfed in dreadful chaos.]
116: 2027| [45] [Nobody seemed to know what was going on.]
117: 2058| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 2059| [45] [(Where are the terrorists!? Where did they set the bombs!?)]
119: 2073| [45] [As he looked around with that in mind,]
120: 2081| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2084| [45] ["!?"]
122: 2122| [45] [he noticed Mashiro and Salyu right behind him.]
123: 2130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 2133| [45] ["Wh... what are you doing!? Why did you come down here!?"]
125: 2159| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 2162| [45] ["We should ask you the same thing! Where do you think you're going all by yourself!?"]
127: 2170| [47] [Salyu]
128: 2173| [45] ["It's dangerous to go alone!"]
129: 2181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 2184| [45] ["I know, I know! But--"]
131: 2189| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko began to speak,]
132: 2194| [45] [another memory of the past came to him--!]
133: 2301| [45] [--It was the same back then.]
134: 2306| [45] [Yuuri had followed him even though he had told her to wait for him.]
135: 2368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2371| [45] ["Yuuri, you can't come! There's a fire, you know!?"]
137: 2379| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 2382| [45] ["I-I want to save the professor too, okay...!"]
139: 2408| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 2411| [45] ["I don't want to sit by and wait while you and the professor are in danger, okay!"]
141: 2419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2422| [45] ["...!"]
143: 2427| [45] [Yuuri sounded somehow different from usual.]
144: 2432| [45] [That was the first time he had heard such a powerful voice from her.]
145: 2437| [45] [So the Natsuhiko of nine years ago--]
146: 2445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2448| [45] ["... Okay..."]
148: 2453| [45] [--ended up answering that way.]
149: 2461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2464| [45] ["Then let's go together! Let's both save Mom!"]
151: 2490| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2493| [45] ["Yeah!"]
153: 2630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2631| [45] [(--Why is everything repeating itself!?)]
155: 2636| [45] [It didn't seem like a mere coincidence, but something tinged with fate.]
156: 2641| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 2642| [45] [(What happened after we went down nine years ago!?)]
158: 2647| [45] [When he tried to remember, he was struck by another intense headache.]
159: 2681| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2684| [45] ["Oww!"]
161: 2710| [47] [Salyu]
162: 2713| [45] ["Natsuhiko, do you have a headache again!?"]
163: 2721| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2724| [45] ["Gh... guh, uuuuuuggh...!"]
165: 2750| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 2753| [45] ["Are you okay, Natsuhiko!? Hang in there!"]
167: 2787| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2790| [45] ["..."]
169: 2795| [45] [The headache made him nauseous.]
170: 2800| [45] [Each time he tried to invoke his memory, he was struck by this pain.]
171: 2805| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2806| [45] [(Damn... it...! Is my desire not to remember really that bad!?)]
173: 2811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2812| [45] [(It should be obvious to me what happened after that, shouldn't it!?)]
175: 2817| [45] [He got caught in the fire with Yuuri and almost died.]
176: 2822| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2823| [45] [(But there's no way I can yield to that fear...!)]
178: 2828| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind, he heard another explosion from nearby.]
179: 2893| [47] [All 3]
180: 2896| [45] ["!?"]
181: 2981| [45] [Natsuhiko promptly covered Mashiro and Salyu.]
182: 2986| [45] [One second later, a blazing wind shot by,]
183: 2994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2997| [45] ["Aghh!!"]
185: 3074| [45] [and the kids were blown away.]
186: 3182| [47] [Broadcast]
187: 3185| [45] ["Heightened readings confirmed in Area N...! Emergency shutdown system has been initiated!"]
188: 3193| [47] [Broadcast]
189: 3196| [45] ["All personnel, including those in the Area N control room, please evacuate to the surface levels immediately!"]
190: 3221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 3224| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
192: 3232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 3235| [45] ["A-are you two okay!?"]
194: 3240| [45] [They slowly got up after having fallen on top of each other.]
195: 3274| [47] [Salyu]
196: 3277| [45] ["... Y... yeah..."]
197: 3311| [47] [Mashiro]
198: 3314| [45] ["I-I'm okay...!"]
199: 3319| [45] [The two groaned, but they appeared to be uninjured.]
200: 3324| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 3325| [45] [(Thank goodness...!)]
202: 3330| [45] [Though relieved, Natsuhiko searched for the origin of the explosion.]
203: 3335| [45] [The explosion sounded like it came from the direction of the staircase they just descended--]
204: 3343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 3346| [45] ["--No way!?"]
206: 3351| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped and dashed for the staircase.]
207: 3400| [45] [But,]
208: 3498| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3501| [45] ["... Dammit!"]
210: 3506| [45] [what was waiting for them was the collapsed ruins of a staircase.]
211: 3514| [47] [Mashiro]
212: 3517| [45] ["They destroyed the staircase!?"]
213: 3525| [47] [Salyu]
214: 3528| [45] ["But there wasn't anyone here, so how...!?"]
215: 3536| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3539| [45] ["Dammit, this is all their doing!"]
217: 3544| [45] [It was the very same trick they used at the PRC.]
218: 3549| [45] [The sleeper agent carried in a time bomb and set it in the facility-- and probably not just one bomb, but several.]
219: 3554| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3555| [45] [(They've destroyed the exit...! We're trapped in the basement!)]
221: 3563| [47] [Salyu]
222: 3566| [45] ["How could the situation have gotten this bad...?"]
223: 3668| [47] [Mashiro]
224: 3671| [45] ["What do we do, Natsuhiko!?"]
225: 3883| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth and looked at his watch.]
226: 3888| [45] [He wanted to know how just how much time they had left--]
227: 3896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3899| [45] ["Ah..."]
229: 3904| [45] [But his watch had broken before he realized it.]
230: 3909| [45] [Apparently it had slammed onto the floor when the first explosion knocked him over.]
231: 3914| [45] [The watch's date had stopped at 9/16. Its hands at 6:19.]
232: 3919| [45] [A time he'd likely never forget for the rest of his life.]
233: 3972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3973| [45] [(If only we had gotten here just a little bit sooner...!)]
235: 3978| [45] [But even if they were late, there was still meaning in their arrival.]
236: 4091| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to walk off unsteadily, but Mashiro grabbed his hand.]
237: 4099| [47] [Mashiro]
238: 4102| [45] ["Hold it, Natsuhiko! Where do you think you're going in a crisis like this!?"]
239: 4110| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 4113| [45] ["I'm gonna find those bastards...!"]
241: 4139| [47] [Salyu]
242: 4142| [45] ["--Wait, Natsuhiko, you don't mean!?"]
243: 4150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 4153| [45] ["... I'm gonna put an end to their plan. I can still do something--"]
245: 4194| [47] [Mashiro]
246: 4197| [45] ["No, you can't! Natsuhiko, calm down!"]
247: 4205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 4208| [45] ["Why!? You agreed that we should come here, didn't you, Mashiro!?"]
249: 4234| [47] [Mashiro]
250: 4237| [45] ["The situation's completely changed! It's too late now!"]
251: 4245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 4248| [45] ["It's never too late! I'm sure I can still make it!"]
253: 4274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 4277| [45] ["Besides, even if we do run, it's not gonna change anything! So in that case--"]
255: 4347| [45] [The moment those words left his lips, a sharp pain ran through his cheek.]
256: 4354| [45] [Mashiro had slapped him.]
257: 4362| [47] [Natsuhiko]
258: 4365| [45] ["...!"]
259: 4373| [47] [Mashiro]
260: 4376| [45] ["Do you want to suffer another loss that badly...!?"]
261: 4381| [45] [Those words gouged out Natsuhiko's heart.]
262: 4471| [45] [--And then, another roar rang out.]
263: 4479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 4482| [45] ["!?"]
265: 4508| [47] [Salyu]
266: 4511| [45] ["Another explosion... where...?"]
267: 4537| [47] [Mashiro]
268: 4540| [45] ["Please, Natsuhiko. Let's get out of here already!"]
269: 4545| [45] [Mashiro's pleading voice caused Natsuhiko's heart to waver.]
270: 4550| [45] [--The current situation was progressing as if it were following the incident nine years ago to a tee.]
271: 4555| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't want to repeat the same mistakes he made that time.]
272: 4560| [45] [He didn't want any of the people precious to him to suffer again--]
273: 4565| [45] [Holding those convictions in his heart, he forced himself to speak.]
274: 4573| [47] [Natsuhiko]
275: 4576| [45] ["... Okay. Let's look for a way out of here first...!"]
276: 4614| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu's faces relaxed in relief at those words.]
277: 4622| [47] [Natsuhiko]
278: 4625| [45] ["I'll lead the way. Salyu, you take the rear."]
279: 4633| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 4636| [45] ["... Let's work under the assumption that we will come across the terrorists."]
281: 4662| [47] [Salyu]
282: 4665| [45] ["Roger."]
283: 4691| [47] [Mashiro]
284: 4694| [45] ["O-okay."]
285: 4894| [45] [The three of them ran off with tense looks in their faces.]
286: 4975| [45] [As they ran, Natsuhiko glanced at his broken watch.]
287: 4980| [45] [At the only present he ever received from his mother.]
288: 4985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
289: 4986| [45] [(... There's something I need to do before I escape.)]
290: 4991| [45] [His mother was likely still inside the facility.]
291: 4996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 4997| [45] [(We were too late to stop the terrorist attack, but at the very least, I want to ensure an escape route for Mashiro, Salyu, and...)]
293: 5002| [45] [And his mother.]
294: 5007| [45] [That was Natsuhiko's earnest wish.]
295: 5118| [47] [Natsuhiko]
296: 5121| [45] ["Let's look for another staircase! There has to be a safe one somewhere!"]
297: 5147| [47] [Mashiro]
298: 5150| [45] ["Do you know the layout of the facility!?"]
299: 5158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 5161| [45] ["No, I obviously can't remember all the details--"]
301: 5187| [47] [Salyu]
302: 5190| [45] ["Then we should look into it first. It's dangerous to run blindly without an escape plan."]
303: 5195| [45] [And with that, Salyu dashed into a nearby room.]
304: 5457| [45] [It was a laboratory devoid of any people.]
305: 5557| [45] [Salyu looked for a computer that was left on and connected Alice to it.]
306: 5565| [47] [Natsuhiko]
307: 5568| [45] ["Salyu, what are you doing!?"]
308: 5661| [47] [Salyu]
309: 5664| [45] ["I'm looking up a map of the facility. Though I'm not sure if there is one."]
310: 5691| [47] [Salyu]
311: 5694| [45] ["Alice, start command."]
312: 5702| [47] [Salyu]
313: 5705| [45] ["Search all networked files."]
314: 5713| [47] [Salyu]
315: 5716| [45] ["Search with high priority on terms synonymous with 'map' and 'chart' and with lower priority on 'facility', 'LABO' and 'lab'."]
316: 5724| [47] [Salyu]
317: 5727| [45] ["Check for password protected files and folders and access them."]
318: 5735| [47] [Salyu]
319: 5738| [45] ["Download all relevant files. End command."]
320: 5761| [47] [Alice]
321: 5764| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
322: 5769| [45] [Alice's back opened, exposing her screen.]
323: 5774| [45] [The screen displayed a list of all the files she had downloaded. Salyu skimmed through them with her fingertip.]
324: 5800| [47] [Mashiro]
325: 5803| [45] ["Please be there...!"]
326: 5808| [45] [Right after Mashiro prayed for her to find the map, Salyu's eyes widened.]
327: 5835| [47] [Salyu]
328: 5838| [45] ["--This is it. Probably."]
329: 5843| [45] [The kids peeked at the screen to see a hexagonal map.]
330: 6058| [47] [Natsuhiko]
331: 6061| [45] ["Yeah... That's it, no doubt!"]
332: 6066| [45] [Just like the ground levels, the basement floors were also hexagonal-- apparently divided into six areas.]
333: 6079| [45] [Salyu pointed at the top of the map.]
334: 6087| [47] [Salyu]
335: 6090| [45] ["Judging by the placement of the entrance, we're currently here in Area 1's outer ring, B1."]
336: 6133| [47] [Salyu]
337: 6136| [45] ["I think that last broken staircase we saw was the outer ring emergency staircase."]
338: 6152| [47] [Mashiro]
339: 6155| [45] ["Looks like there's an inner ring emergency staircase nearby too, huh..."]
340: 6160| [45] [Just as Mashiro had said, each area apparently had an emergency staircase and an elevator.]
341: 6279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 6282| [45] ["Okay, so let's head there first!"]
343: 6287| [45] [The kids nodded at each other and ran out of the room.]
344: 6336| [45] [They crossed through the connecting passageway and headed to the inner ring.]
345: 6341| [45] [En route to the passageway, there was what appeared to be one of those "security gates" that the security guard had mentioned, but it was left wide open.]
346: 6346| [45] [But once they reached the inner ring--]
347: 6654| [45] [--it was engulfed in fire.]
348: 6662| [47] [Natsuhiko]
349: 6665| [45] ["Fire!? How'd a fire break out here so fast!?"]
350: 6673| [47] [Mashiro]
351: 6676| [45] ["Was it because of the explosions...!?"]
352: 6684| [47] [Salyu]
353: 6687| [45] ["No, it'd be way too fast for that to have been the cause. They might have brought incendiary bombs as well and set one here."]
354: 6695| [47] [Mashiro]
355: 6698| [45] ["Don't tell me it was set here to prevent the people from escaping the facility...?"]
356: 6706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
357: 6709| [45] ["Gh... it's too dangerous here! Let's look for another path!"]
358: 6714| [45] [Natsuhiko grabbed the girls' hands and retreated to the passageway.]
359: 6829| [45] [--Their escape routes were quickly crumbling down one by one.]
360: 6837| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 6840| [45] ["Mashiro! Salyu! There was an elevator on the map too! Go see if it's still usable!"]
362: 6848| [47] [Mashiro]
363: 6851| [45] ["What about you, Natsuhiko!?"]
364: 6859| [47] [Natsuhiko]
365: 6862| [45] ["I'll go check if the path to Area 2 is safe!"]
366: 6888| [47] [Salyu]
367: 6891| [45] ["Roger. Be careful!"]
368: 6999| [45] [Natsuhiko split from the girls for the time being.]
369: 7068| [47] [Natsuhiko]
370: 7069| [45] [(First we need to ensure an escape route. If there's a safe emergency staircase, I can get them out through there!)]
371: 7074| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko walked into the connecting passageway to Area 2--]
372: 7144| [45] [--but then he doubted his eyes.]
373: 7154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
374: 7157| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
375: 7241| [45] [There she stood.]
376: 7246| [45] [The girl who was supposed to be waiting for them at home. Yuuri.]
377: 7467| [47] [Natsuhiko]
378: 7470| [45] ["--Yuuri!?"]
379: 7573| [45] [Natsuhiko's voice cracked as it escaped from his mouth.]
380: 7668| [45] [He couldn't believe what his eyes were telling him.]
381: 7673| [47] [Natsuhiko]
382: 7674| [45] [(I thought she wasn't able to take a single step out from the house...!?)]
383: 7679| [45] [Natsuhiko gazed at her in shock, and--]
384: 7705| [47] [Yuuri]
385: 7708| [45] ["... Hikorin..."]
386: 7734| [47] [Yuuri]
387: 7737| [45] ["Why did you come here...!?"]
388: 7742| [45] [--she muttered sadly.]
389: 7750| [47] [Natsuhiko]
390: 7753| [45] ["What about you, Yuuri!? Why are -you- here!?"]
391: 7761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
392: 7764| [45] ["You left home!?"]
393: 7769| [45] [Right after Natsuhiko asked that question, for some reason--]
394: 8113| [45] [--his memories of the last few days came rushing back into his mind.]
395: 8459| [47] [Natsuhiko]
396: 8462| [45] ["!?"]
397: 8806| [45] [Visions of the events of September 10th up until today spun rapidly through his mind like the illustrations on a revolving lantern--]
398: 9150| [45] [--and then disappeared.]
399: 9234| [47] [Natsuhiko]
400: 9235| [45] [(Wh... what!?)]
401: 9240| [45] [Natsuhiko had no idea what happened.]
402: 9245| [45] [Yuuri gazed at him in his confusion.]
403: 9271| [47] [Yuuri]
404: 9274| [45] ["... So that's what happened..."]
405: 9279| [45] [Her expression was somehow sad, yet she smiled as if a weight had been taken off her shoulders.]
406: 9284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
407: 9285| [45] [(What does that even mean...!?)]
408: 9290| [45] [There was something clearly strange about that exchange.]
409: 9295| [45] [It was almost as if Yuuri had read Natsuhiko's mind.]
410: 9300| [45] [The same sort of thing happened a few days before, too.]
411: 9305| [47] [Natsuhiko]
412: 9306| [45] [(Don't tell me Yuuri's actually--)]
413: 9385| [45] [But before he could finish that thought, a flash flickered beside them.]
414: 9506| [47] [Natsuhiko]
415: 9509| [45] ["!! Yuuri!"]
416: 9592| [45] [Natsuhiko swiftly lunged at Yuuri. And not a second later, a shockwave struck them.]
417: 9600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
418: 9603| [45] ["Ah!!"]
419: 9608| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri were blown away.]
420: 9654| [45] [In the split second before they hit the ground,]
421: 9659| [45] [a vision of that fateful morning rose up from the back of his mind.]
422: 9928| [47] [That morning six days ago. September 10, 2030.]
423: 10030| [47] [His memory of that day back when everything was still peaceful--]
424: 10187| [47] [Yuuri]
425: 10190| [45] ["... Dreadful incidents don't just happen on the other side of the TV screen."]
426: 10271| [47] [Mashiro]
427: 10274| [45] ["Natsuhiko, was that... BC?"]
428: 10351| [47] [Ukita]
429: 10354| [45] ["Hopefully I'm just being a little paranoid... no, I probably am."]
430: 10448| [47] [Natsuhiko]
431: 10451| [45] ["Peace and quiet really is the best. There's no point in putting yourself in danger."]
432: 10564| [45] [--Those memories led to the end of September 10.]
433: 10569| [45] [Yuuri looked at Natsuhiko and spoke.]
434: 10729| [47] [Yuuri]
435: 10732| [45] ["... I think a lot of things will start happening to you from now on, Hikorin."]
436: 10740| [47] [Yuuri]
437: 10743| [45] ["Fun things, painful things... and things you cannot overcome without courage."]
438: 10751| [47] [Yuuri]
439: 10754| [45] ["But they're all things you surely mustn't avoid..."]
440: 10759| [45] [--As he recalled those memories--]
441: 10764| [45] [Natsuhiko passed out.]
