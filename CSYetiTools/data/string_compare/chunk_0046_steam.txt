  0:    1| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 3]
  1:    8| [47] [Watase]
  2:   11| [45] ["Okay, looks good to go. Get on my back and I'll climb us up to the top."]
  3:   50| [47] [Ena]
  4:   53| [45] ["Wait, can you pull that off? I mean, I'm heavy in my own way, you know."]
  5:   61| [47] [Watase]
  6:   64| [45] ["Oh come on, you're as light as a feather. And we're only climbing 4 or 5 meters up."]
  7:   72| [47] [Watase]
  8:   75| [45] ["So come on, hurry up and get on my back."]
  9:   80| [45] [Oddly enough, he was totally confident that he'd have no problems climbing even with Ena on his back.]
 10:  100| [45] [Perhaps that confidence had come through to her, as after a moment's hesitation, Ena wrapped her arms around Watase's shoulders.]
 11:  108| [47] [Watase]
 12:  111| [45] ["Okay, here we go. Hang on tight."]
 13:  119| [47] [Ena]
 14:  122| [45] ["R-right."]
 15:  127| [45] [Watase began climbing the rope with her voice as the trigger.]
 16:  196| [45] [It was probably an action that'd been drilled into him in training.]
 17:  201| [45] [Watase got up to the top with little to no effort, even with the weight of two.]
 18:  214| [47] [Ena]
 19:  217| [45] ["Th-that was amazing...!"]
 20:  225| [47] [Watase]
 21:  228| [45] ["Guess it's a basic skill for rescue workers. I mean, it didn't even feel dangerous at all."]
 22:  236| [47] [Ena]
 23:  239| [45] ["Hmm... looks like you really are becoming more and more like a rescue worker with time."]
 24:  247| [47] [Watase]
 25:  250| [45] ["What do you mean 'like'? I actually am one, remember?"]
 26:  295| [45] [Ena giggled at Watase's complaints.]
 27:  300| [45] [Her body shook to the beat of her laughter--]
 28:  305| [45] [And it was only then that Watase noticed the two sensations pressing against his back.]
 29:  310| [47] [Watase]
 30:  311| [45] [(... They're huge.)]
 31:  316| [45] [Watase gulped.]
 32:  321| [47] [Watase]
 33:  322| [45] [(... This size sure as hell isn't normal... what cup is she!?)]
 34:  327| [45] [It was a wonder why he hadn't noticed those two well-rounded objects up until now.]
 35:  332| [47] [Watase]
 36:  333| [45] [(...! What the hell's wrong with me!? What kind of dumbass am I!?)]
 37:  338| [47] [Watase]
 38:  339| [45] [(Clean thoughts, Watase Kasasagi, clean thoughts! The survivors could be waiting to be rescued on this floor right now at this very second, and I'm just standing here and...!)]
 39:  344| [45] [But he couldn't clear his head of those thoughts.]
 40:  349| [45] [It wasn't long before Ena became taken aback and spoke.]
 41:  397| [47] [Ena]
 42:  400| [45] ["... Captain, you're not trying to hide something now, are you?"]
 43:  405| [47] [Watase]
 44:  406| [45] [(!? Is this woman an esper or something!?)]
 45:  414| [47] [Watase]
 46:  417| [45] ["Hahah, of course not... what makes you think that?"]
 47:  425| [47] [Ena]
 48:  428| [45] ["The fact that you suddenly stopped talking. I'm not liking this silence for some reason..."]
 49:  436| [47] [Watase]
 50:  439| [45] ["I was too focused on the climbing, that's why!"]
 51:  447| [47] [Ena]
 52:  450| [45] ["Liar. This isn't the same 'calm and composure' you had just a minute ago."]
 53:  458| [47] [Watase]
 54:  461| [45] ["Q-quit accusing me. I just got a bit too worked up, that's all."]
 55:  469| [47] [Watase]
 56:  472| [45] ["I was worried that we'd both get badly hurt if my hands slipped even for a second."]
 57:  477| [47] [Ena]
 58:  478| [45] ["..."]
 59:  526| [47] [Ena]
 60:  529| [45] ["... That's true. My safety -is- in your hands, after all."]
 61:  539| [45] [Ena smiled slightly and put some strength into her arms.]
 62:  547| [47] [Ena]
 63:  550| [45] ["I won't distract you anymore... I trust you, in a whole lot of ways."]
 64:  558| [47] [Watase]
 65:  561| [45] ["That's really good to know. Let's focus back on the searching for now."]
 66:  566| [45] [The two of them smiled at their playful conversation.]
 67:  571| [45] [... In hindsight, perhaps they were being a bit -too- carefree, given the situation.]
 68:  576| [45] [But small talk like that felt extremely precious to Watase.]
