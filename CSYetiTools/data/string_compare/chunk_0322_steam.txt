  0:   64| [45] [--When Natsuhiko looked into those memories--]
  1:   69| [45] [He saw scenes leading up to when Ukita had committed the terrorist attack appear and disappear.]
  2:  100| [45] [Ukita's fate had changed approximately two years ago.]
  3:  105| [45] [He had been nothing more than a diligent researcher of LABO up until that point--]
  4:  156| [45] [But one day, he inadvertently discovered LABO's top secret information.]
  5:  161| [45] [Specifically, he learned that there was at least one "test subject" confined in "Area Zero",%Na third basement level that normal researchers weren't allowed into.]
  6:  166| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  167| [45] [(Impossible... does this mean that LABO is conducting human experimentation underground...!?)]
  8:  172| [45] [Ukita didn't want to believe that the workplace he was so attached to was secretly doing that kind of thing behind closed doors.]
  9:  222| [45] [But the more he investigated, the more his doubts grew--]
 10:  227| [45] [Then he finally obtained some undeniable proof.]
 11:  232| [45] [It was in the form of a document regarding the fire that had happened in LABO years ago.]
 12:  237| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  238| [45] [(There's no doubt about it... they're keeping Communicators locked away in LABO...!)]
 14:  243| [45] [And it wasn't just one of them.]
 15:  248| [45] ["Subject N" and "Subject Y-II" were most likely the names of the people they'd confined.]
 16:  312| [45] [When he learned of that, the attachment Ukita had held for LABO for several years shattered into pieces.]
 17:  317| [45] [He too worked at LABO.]
 18:  322| [45] [Not only had he not known anything, he could have been helping with the human experimentation all those years without ever realizing it.]
 19:  327| [45] [Guilt and rage swirled within him--]
 20:  332| [45] [And soon transformed into a sense of justice.]
 21:  337| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  338| [45] [(... I have to save them.)]
 23:  343| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  344| [45] [(I must rescue the test subjects...!)]
 25:  349| [45] [He knew it would probably be nigh-impossible.]
 26:  354| [45] [He was nothing more than a single researcher.]
 27:  410| [45] [Forget about getting into Area Zero. He couldn't even get into Area N.]
 28:  415| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  416| [45] [(And besides, LABO would never forgive me for that...)]
 30:  421| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  422| [45] [(There's a possibility that they'll erase me if I try to bring these secrets to light.)]
 32:  441| [45] [In fact, it appeared there had been a researcher who tried to save a test subject before Ukita--]
 33:  446| [45] [But he died under suspicious circumstances afterwards.]
 34:  451| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  452| [45] [(Will I meet the same fate...?)]
 36:  457| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  458| [45] [(... No! That doesn't matter! I still have to do it!)]
 38:  463| [45] [Ukita was probably the only one in the city at that moment who wished to free the test subjects.]
 39:  468| [45] [If he were the only one who could act, then inaction was a sin.]
 40:  474| [45] [Ukita turned around and glared at LABO's gargantuan shadow.]
 41:  479| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  480| [45] [(... I'll do it.)]
 43:  485| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  486| [45] [(I'll save those test subjects... from this prison.)]
 45:  491| [45] [Ukita's fight began from that day onwards.]
 46:  546| [45] [LABO wasn't his only enemy. The Rokumei City government was in cahoots with them too.]
 47:  551| [45] [He knew he couldn't take them on by himself, so he looked for help.]
 48:  556| [45] [But neither the police nor the media looked viable.]
 49:  605| [45] [It was when Ukita had thought he was at a dead end that he was contacted by none other than--]
 50:  610| [45] [--"Q", the largest domestic anti-BC terrorist organization.]
 51:  615| [45] [They had a grudge against LABO, and their interests matched up with Ukita's.]
 52:  620| [45] [Ukita felt quite uneasy about joining a terrorist organization, but he reluctantly decided to accept their help.]
 53:  689| [45] [--It was after that when he met Watase--]
 54:  694| [45] [The two of them swore to fight against LABO together.]
 55:  720| [47] [Watase]
 56:  723| [45] ["... I'll help you out as much as I'm needed to."]
 57:  731| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  734| [45] ["... I am grateful beyond words to hear that."]
 59:  739| [45] [Ukita then gave a firm handshake to his newfound comrade.]
 60:  794| [45] [The two of them then conceived the terrorist plot together...]
 61:  799| [45] [And on September 16, they finally put their plan into motion.]
 62:  856| [45] [--Ukita detonated bombs disguised as fire extinguishers, which caused fires and summoned the rescue squad--]
 63:  861| [45] [Then he and Watase's group took advantage of the pandemonium to rescue the test subjects.]
 64:  866| [45] [Everything was going according to plan, thanks to the careful set-up they put into it.]
 65:  871| [45] [... Yes, everything was supposed to have gone as planned.]
 66:  876| [45] [Or at least it had been until Watase's group returned from Area Zero.]
 67:  881| [45] [--There were supposed to be two test subjects, but the group had only taken "Subject N" with them.]
 68:  886| [45] ["Subject Y-II" had been nowhere to be seen. A minor setback, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.]
 69:  891| [45] [... The -real- problem was that Watase's group had killed the high ranked researchers down in Area Zero...!]
 70:  963| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  966| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, this isn't what you promised!"]
 72:  974| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  977| [45] ["You told me there'd be no casualties, remember!?"]
 74: 1003| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1006| [45] ["N-no... it was an accident."]
 76: 1014| [47] [Ukita]
 77: 1017| [45] ["An accident!? Are you saying those two died in an accident!?"]
 78: 1022| [45] [Ukita then tried to grab Watase, but then--]
 79: 1080| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1083| [45] ["!"]
 81: 1088| [45] [A shock ran through the back of his head.]
 82: 1093| [45] [Watase had hit him there with the butt of his gun.]
 83: 1108| [47] [Ukita]
 84: 1111| [45] ["Wh... y...?"]
 85: 1116| [45] [Ukita's heart was filled with the bitter thought that he had been betrayed.]
 86: 1185| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1188| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Mr. Ukita."]
 88: 1196| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1199| [45] ["It's too late... for us to turn back."]
 90: 1204| [45] [He felt he could make out Watase saying that as his consciousness faded.]
 91: 1213| [45] [--Ukita woke up a little while later.]
 92: 1218| [45] [It wasn't long after that when he reunited with Watase--]
 93: 1350| [45] [But for some reason, he was accompanied by two female rescue workers from his squad, a high school teacher, and a mysterious girl.]
 94: 1355| [45] [Utterly confused, Ukita asked Watase what was going on, and he only had this to say:]
 95: 1381| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1384| [45] ["The truth is, it looks like I hit my head really hard a little while back... and thanks to that, I can barely remember anything..."]
 97: 1392| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1395| [45] ["Barely remember anything... Are you serious!?"]
 99: 1567| [45] [Ukita was suspicious.]
100: 1599| [45] [He didn't know why Watase would say something like that.]
101: 1604| [45] [Perhaps he was lying to hide his involvement in the terrorist plot from the others.]
102: 1609| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1610| [45] [(... At any rate, Captain Kasasagi is dangerous...!)]
104: 1643| [47] [Ukita]
105: 1644| [45] [(I must protect the test subjects...!)]
106: 1649| [45] [He didn't know what they looked like.]
107: 1681| [45] [But it was possible that this "Yuuri" girl who was accompanying Watase was in fact "Subject Y-II".]
108: 1735| [45] [What's more, he had to protect Natsuhiko and his friends, who'd accidentally gotten trapped in LABO.]
109: 1754| [47] [Ukita]
110: 1755| [45] [(Don't let your guard down... The plan is still underway.)]
111: 1760| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1761| [45] [(Even if Captain Kasasagi has betrayed me, I swear... I will save them all.)]
113: 1789| [45] [--Natsuhiko felt surprised as he finished watching that memory.]
114: 1794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1795| [45] [(... So Mr. Ukita was acting this whole time to protect us.)]
116: 1800| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1801| [45] [(And at the same time, he kept his guard up high because he didn't know Watase's true intentions...!)]
118: 1806| [45] [At any rate, those appeared to be Ukita's "motive" and "intentions".]
119: 1811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1812| [45] [(Then what happened after this...?)]
121: 1863| [45] [Natsuhiko kept searching through Ukita's memories for the answer--]
122: 1868| [45] [Only to smell a floral scent drifting in from somewhere.]
123: 1876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1877| [45] [(! The floral scent...!)]
125: 1882| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1883| [45] [(This is it! Mr. Ukita's memories were distorted after this point!)]
127: 1894| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness tensed up at that moment.]
128: 1946| [45] [Yuuri's voice echoed in his head.]
129: 1970| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1973| [45] [{Hikorin! Look for that floral scent in the memories past this part!}]
131: 1978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1979| [45] [(Yeah!)]
133: 1984| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 1987| [45] [{Then try to remember what happened after this point.}]
135: 2011| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 2014| [45] [{Remember how Mr. Ukita felt...}]
137: 2038| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 2041| [45] [{His memories should be repaired to their proper form depending on your feelings.}]
139: 2046| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 2049| [45] [{Once you've done that, you can return him back to normal.}]
141: 2067| [45] [Natsuhiko fortified his determination and began memory access once again.]
142: 2119| [45] [His search criterion was-- "floral-scented memories".]
