  0:   81| [45] [--It was the memory that Mashiro regretted the most.]
  1:   86| [45] [The day Natsuhiko and Yuuri went to LABO--]
  2:   91| [45] [In that memory, Mashiro talked with Natsuhiko.]
  3:  130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  133| [45] ["--We're going to LABO to save Mom."]
  5:  138| [45] [Mashiro's eyes opened wide at those words.]
  6:  143| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  146| [45] ["Stop it, Natsuhiko! It's dangerous! You shouldn't go to a place like that!"]
  8:  172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  175| [45] ["Why not?"]
 10:  180| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  183| [45] ["There are rumors that they do dangerous research there, you know..."]
 12:  188| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  191| [45] ["And besides, 'ra-di-ation' comes outta there, so you can't ever go inside! Dad told me so!"]
 14:  217| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  220| [45] ["Huh, what's wrong, Mashiro? You chicken? Well fine, I guess I'll just go ask Yuuri then~"]
 16:  225| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  228| [45] ["... What's that supposed to mean!? Lately you've been Yuuri this and Yuuri that...!"]
 18:  233| [45] [Mashiro loved Yuuri too, and thought of her as a close friend despite their age difference.]
 19:  238| [45] [But for some reason, Mashiro didn't like it whenever Natsuhiko said Yuuri's name.]
 20:  264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  267| [45] ["What? Don't tell me you're jealous? But you're just a tomboy."]
 22:  272| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  275| [45] ["...!"]
 24:  280| [45] [She could feel her cheeks turn red.]
 25:  285| [45] [As the blood rushed to her head--]
 26:  290| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  293| [45] ["Fine, I don't care about you anymore, Natsuhiko! Go buzz off with Yuuri and see if I care!"]
 28:  298| [45] [--Mashiro ended up yelling those words.]
 29:  303| [45] [Those words she would later come to regret for years and years...]
 30:  373| [45] [And after that, Natsuhiko and Yuuri went to LABO.]
 31:  378| [45] [Mashiro had no idea what happened there.]
 32:  443| [45] [--Three days later.]
 33:  448| [45] [Mashiro came to the park by herself.]
 34:  453| [45] [She thought it was about time for her to make up with Natsuhiko.]
 35:  458| [45] [She was going to apologize when she saw him at school, but neither Natsuhiko nor Yuuri had attended since the day before yesterday, so she never had a chance.]
 36:  463| [47] [Mashiro]
 37:  464| [45] [(That was just another one of our little fights, right...? Things will be back to normal after we play for a day, won't they?)]
 38:  469| [45] [When she and Natsuhiko played alone, neither ever yielded, but whenever Yuuri was with them, things would be okay.]
 39:  474| [45] [If Yuuri were there to bind them together, then they'd definitely be able to make up soon.]
 40:  479| [45] [And with that plan in mind, Mashiro waited--]
 41:  484| [45] [But Natsuhiko just wasn't coming, it seemed.]
 42:  489| [45] [Even though he almost always showed up around this time.]
 43:  494| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  495| [45] ["..."]
 45:  500| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  503| [45] ["Should I go to Natsuhiko's place...?"]
 47:  508| [45] [Eventually, Mashiro muttered that and walked off.]
 48:  603| [45] [Once she reached Natsuhiko's house, she tried pressing the doorbell.]
 49:  614| [45] [But nobody came.]
 50:  643| [45] [There was no response no matter how many times she pushed the button.]
 51:  648| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  651| [45] ["... That's strange."]
 53:  656| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  659| [45] ["Excuse me~? Is anybody home~?"]
 55:  664| [45] [The moment she spoke up-- she heard a voice from behind her.]
 56:  669| [47] [???]
 57:  672| [45] ["... Mashiro?"]
 58:  789| [45] [She turned around in shock to see Natsuhiko's mother, Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa, standing there.]
 59:  794| [47] [Mashiro]
 60:  797| [45] ["Ah, Professor."]
 61:  802| [45] [When Mashiro called her by that name, the professor spoke to her in a tired voice.]
 62:  828| [47] [Miyoko]
 63:  831| [45] ["... What's wrong?"]
 64:  836| [47] [Mashiro]
 65:  839| [45] ["Umm, I came here to see Natsuhiko, but he doesn't seem to be in."]
 66:  844| [47] [Mashiro]
 67:  847| [45] ["Where did he go?"]
 68:  870| [47] [Miyoko]
 69:  871| [45] ["..."]
 70:  879| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  882| [45] ["... You haven't heard yet, have you..."]
 72:  887| [47] [Mashiro]
 73:  890| [45] ["Heard what?"]
 74:  916| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  919| [45] ["... Natsuhiko is in the hospital."]
 76:  924| [47] [Mashiro]
 77:  927| [45] ["Hospital!?"]
 78:  935| [47] [Miyoko]
 79:  938| [45] ["There was a fire at LABO, and he and Yuuri got caught in it..."]
 80:  943| [47] [Mashiro]
 81:  946| [45] ["W-was he hospitalized?"]
 82:  951| [47] [Mashiro]
 83:  954| [45] ["Yuuri was with him... so is Yuuri in the hospital too!?"]
 84:  980| [47] [Miyoko]
 85:  983| [45] ["... Yuuri's... no longer with us."]
 86:  988| [47] [Mashiro]
 87:  991| [45] ["...?"]
 88: 1043| [45] [With a dark expression on her face, the professor stepped up to Mashiro-- %Nand held her by the shoulders as she spoke slowly.]
 89: 1051| [47] [Miyoko]
 90: 1054| [45] ["Mashiro... You see, after she was rescued..."]
 91: 1062| [47] [Miyoko]
 92: 1065| [45] ["... Yuuri never woke up..."]
 93: 1073| [47] [Miyoko]
 94: 1076| [45] ["And last night...!"]
 95: 1081| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1084| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 97: 1095| [45] [--The moment she heard those words--]
 98: 1100| [45] [Mashiro felt her peaceful days come crashing to an end.]
