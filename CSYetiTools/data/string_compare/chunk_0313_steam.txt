  7:  207| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  210| [45] ["I've heard about it before, but... it's incredible what LABO was able to create by mustering all of its efforts."]
  9:  236| [47] [Miyoko]
 10:  239| [45] ["Indeed. But there's still a long way to go before it's completely stable."]
 11:  265| [47] [Miyoko]
 12:  268| [45] ["That's why you'll mainly be in charge of operating the WX particle amplifier."]
 13:  276| [47] [Miyoko]

 28:  394| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  397| [45] ["U-understood. I'll keep that in mind."]
 30:  423| [47] [Miyoko]
 31:  426| [45] ["Well, that matter aside... There's actually one more job I would like to entrust to you, Mr. Ukita."]
 32:  434| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  437| [45] ["Are there some data you'd like me to examine?"]
 34:  463| [47] [Miyoko]
 35:  466| [45] ["No. It's not related to your duties as a researcher. I'd like you to be my son's 'observer'."]
 36:  474| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  477| [45] ["What do you mean... by observer?"]
 38:  503| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  506| [45] ["You see, my son Natsuhiko actually has an IGF2R Gene Abnormality of Type S."]
 40:  514| [47] [Ukita]
 41:  517| [45] ["Type S!? That's--!"]
 42:  543| [47] [Miyoko]
 43:  546| [45] ["Yes. An extremely rare occurrence. They say it occurs in only one out of every 30 million births."]
 44:  572| [47] [Miyoko]
 45:  575| [45] ["But Natsuhiko hasn't manifested his BC abilities once."]
 46:  583| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  586| [45] ["However, LABO still cannot ignore his case. Thus they've made him an observation target."]
 48:  612| [47] [Miyoko]
 49:  615| [45] ["His former observer lived in the house across from ours, but he retired the other day. And you live next door to us, so--"]

 51:  626| [45] ["--Please wait a moment. I live right next door to you?"]
 52:  652| [47] [Miyoko]
 53:  655| [45] ["Oh? Were you not aware of that?"]
 54:  663| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  666| [45] ["Not at all. We haven't seen each other once in our neighborhood, so..."]
 56:  692| [47] [Miyoko]
 57:  695| [45] ["True, perhaps we never did have any opportunities for that. I practically live here in LABO now, after all."]
 58:  721| [47] [Miyoko]

 60:  732| [47] [Miyoko]
 61:  735| [45] ["All you have to do is watch to see if his BC abilities ever manifest and report at least a little bit about his day to day life."]
 62:  740| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa was always extraordinarily busy. There was no doubt that she had very few opportunities to see her son.]
 63:  748| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  751| [45] ["Understood. I'll accept your request."]
 65:  856| [45] [Since Ukita was also quite busy, he wrote up his observation reports once a month.]

 85:  977| [45] [It appears that he has one more friend in that house,]
 86:  980| [45] [but I have not been able to make any visual confirmation of them.]
 87:  983| [45] [Furthermore, when Na2 inquired to me about how Dr. Tenkawa was doing,]
 88:  986| [45] [I told him "she's working hard".]

 93: 1105| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1106| [45] [(Come to think of it, Mashiro is always with Natsuhiko.)]
 95: 1111| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1112| [45] [(Could that mean that Mashiro has feelings for Natsuhiko...?)]
 97: 1176| [45] [A smiled crossed Ukita's face as that guess filled his mind.]
 98: 1181| [45] [However, his emotions soon changed when reality hit him.]
 99: 1186| [45] [He'd already heard from Dr. Tenkawa that Mashiro Toba had an IGF2R Gene Abnormality%Nof Type B.]
100: 1191| [45] [Those with IGF2R genetic mutations were doomed with short lifespans.]
101: 1196| [45] [According to statistics, the life expectancy of Communicators who were Type B and higher was roughly 33 years.]
102: 1201| [45] [Ukita himself had just turned 33.]
103: 1206| [45] [The thought that Natsuhiko and Mashiro might not even make it to his age was heartwrenching.]
104: 1211| [47] [Ukita]
105: 1212| [45] [(... I want to protect their futures.)]
106: 1293| [45] [He probably would have never thought that way had he never met Dr. Tenkawa.]
107: 1298| [45] [And it was extremely likely that the fact she had a Type S son had only strengthened her desire to save Communicators.]
108: 1303| [47] [Ukita]
109: 1304| [45] [(But... what does Dr. Tenkawa plan on doing if her son, a special observation target, manifests his BC abilities?)]
110: 1309| [47] [Ukita]
111: 1310| [45] [(No, now that I think about it, I've never been told why special observation targets exist to begin with.)]
112: 1315| [47] [Ukita]
113: 1316| [45] [(Natsuhiko has been designated as "Na2", which means there was likely a "Na" that came before him...)]
114: 1338| [45] [Ukita accessed the network using his Observer authority and typed "Target Na" in the search engine on that hunch.]
115: 1344| [45] [But he found nothing relevant. All records had probably been deleted for some reason.]

126: 1425| [85] [　]
127: 1428| [45] [First of all, they wish to determine new consideration criteria regarding confinement procedures for special observation targets.]
128: 1431| [45] [Up until now, the single criterion has been that "special observation targets will be considered for confinement after reaching Ability Level 4".]
129: 1435| [85] [　]

145: 1489| [85] [　]
146: 1492| [45] [Furthermore, the test subject born in LABO shall be confined there permanently unless a special case occurs.]

171: 1753| [45] [Special Observation Target Na2-- Natsuhiko-- still hadn't manifested his BC abilities.]
172: 1758| [45] [That was probably why he'd been able to live a normal life ever since surveillance on him began in 2021, but--]

192: 1904| [45] [In the first place, "test subject" was a word that was used to talk about mice and such used for experiments.]

279: 2912| [47] [Miyoko]
280: 2915| [45] ["If humanity can choose whether or not to use BC, then I don't think they should use it."]
281: 2941| [47] [Miyoko]
282: 2944| [45] ["But regardless of our wishes, more and more new Communicators are being born."]
283: 2970| [47] [Miyoko]
284: 2973| [45] ["So there's no chance that we can stop researching it. We can't leave a power that mindbogglingly strong unchecked."]
285: 2981| [47] [Ukita]
286: 2984| [45] ["Just like you say, maybe it is necessary to continue with BC research."]
287: 2992| [47] [Ukita]
288: 2995| [45] ["But shouldn't we think more carefully about the methods involved in that?"]
289: 3003| [47] [Ukita]
290: 3006| [45] ["We have our ethics as scientists and our ethics as humans. I believe it is when we forget those things that technology goes down the wrong path."]
291: 3014| [47] [Ukita]
292: 3017| [45] ["What are your thoughts on that?"]
293: 3043| [47] [Miyoko]
294: 3046| [45] ["Huh...? Hold on, what sort of question is this?"]
295: 3054| [47] [Ukita]
296: 3057| [45] ["Please just answer the question. I need to hear it."]
297: 3118| [47] [Miyoko]
298: 3121| [45] ["..."]
299: 3147| [47] [Miyoko]
300: 3150| [45] ["Perhaps you're right. However..."]
301: 3176| [47] [Miyoko]
302: 3179| [45] ["At the end of the day, all we can do is pursue the truth and solve the problems before us."]
303: 3187| [47] [Miyoko]
304: 3190| [45] ["Whether that's good or evil is not for us to decide. It is history's job to vindicate or vilify us. That is the way science has always continued to progress."]
305: 3198| [47] [Miyoko]
306: 3201| [45] ["So likewise, I will do whatever it takes to achieve my goal as nothing more than one of those scientists."]
307: 3206| [45] [With those words, something precious in Ukita crumbled apart with a roar.]
308: 3214| [47] [Ukita]
309: 3217| [45] ["In that case... please let me ask you one more question."]
310: 3225| [47] [Ukita]
311: 3228| [45] ["What do you plan on doing with Natsuhiko if his BC abilities manifest?"]
312: 3289| [47] [Miyoko]
313: 3292| [45] ["!?"]
314: 3300| [47] [Miyoko]
315: 3303| [45] ["... Mr. Ukita... don't tell me you...?"]
316: 3308| [47] [Ukita]
317: 3309| [45] ["..."]
318: 3314| [45] [Ukita didn't answer her question.]
319: 3337| [45] [Finally, she sighed and spoke.]
320: 3366| [47] [Miyoko]
321: 3369| [45] ["... Mr. Ukita. As of today, you are hereby relieved of your duty of observing Na2."]
322: 3377| [47] [Miyoko]
323: 3380| [45] ["And as of tomorrow, you will be transferred to another research team."]
324: 3388| [47] [Ukita]
325: 3391| [45] ["... Is that your answer, Dr. Tenkawa?"]
326: 3429| [45] [But Dr. Tenkawa didn't answer and simply walked away from Ukita.]
327: 3539| [45] [Ukita went outside LABO after that.]
328: 3544| [45] [The sky was filled with heavy clouds that threatened to start raining at any moment.]
329: 3552| [47] [Ukita]
330: 3555| [45] ["... Hahah..."]
331: 3560| [45] [He'd started laughing to himself without even noticing it.]
332: 3568| [47] [Ukita]
333: 3571| [45] ["Ha, hahah, hahahah..."]
334: 3579| [47] [Ukita]
335: 3582| [45] ["I worked myself to the bone all this time because I wanted to save Communicators..."]
336: 3590| [47] [Ukita]
337: 3593| [45] ["I finally grew a desire to do something for other's sakes..."]
338: 3601| [47] [Ukita]
339: 3604| [45] ["Yet I never would have guessed that LABO of all places was using those very same Communicators for their own experiments..."]
340: 3612| [47] [Ukita]
341: 3615| [45] ["... Hahah, what a sick joke..."]
342: 3620| [45] [He couldn't stop the dry laughter coming from his throat.]
343: 3625| [45] [Suddenly, he noticed that there were tears running down his cheeks.]
344: 3630| [47] [Ukita]
345: 3631| [45] [(... Must I find a clear solution to this?)]
346: 3636| [47] [Ukita]
347: 3637| [45] [(As a scientist, must I write off this sacrifice as insignificant in the grand scheme of things...?)]
348: 3642| [45] [Indeed. If he had just committed himself to that mindset, he could've continued living his life as he had up until this point.]
349: 3647| [45] [He could've lived as a highly paid LABO scientist with no inconveniences in his life.]
350: 3652| [45] [Whatever happened to that test subject he'd never even seen before would've had no bearing on him.]
351: 3657| [45] [He should have had no issues with any of that. Yet--]
352: 3712| [47] [Ukita]
353: 3715| [45] ["... Preposterous..."]
354: 3723| [47] [Ukita]
355: 3726| [45] ["There is no way in hell I can accept that...!"]
356: 3731| [45] [He couldn't bear to live in such complacency.]
357: 3739| [47] [Ukita]
358: 3742| [45] ["Scientists and test subjects are both humans!"]
359: 3750| [47] [Ukita]
360: 3753| [45] ["No just cause in the world is worth sacrificing them!"]
361: 3772| [45] [An emotion welled up from his heart when he shouted that.]
362: 3777| [47] [Ukita]
363: 3778| [45] [(I have to put a stop to it...!)]
364: 3783| [45] [It was a rage that smashed his devotion to his job to pieces.]
365: 3788| [45] [There was also the pure disgust of participating in such wrongdoings.]
366: 3793| [45] [But by no means was that all.]
367: 3798| [45] [Oddly enough, it was what Dr. Tenkawa had shown him that gave him this conviction.]
368: 3803| [45] [Her good heart that lived for others.]
369: 3811| [47] [Ukita]
370: 3814| [45] ["... I'll do it... I'll saved that trapped test subject...!"]
371: 3819| [45] [He was probably the only one in the city who knew of the test subject and wanted to free them.]
372: 3824| [45] [If he were the only one who could act, then inaction was a sin.]
373: 3829| [47] [Ukita]
374: 3830| [45] [(... Perhaps my motivation is but a fragile, powerless sense of justice.)]
375: 3835| [47] [Ukita]
376: 3836| [45] [(Perhaps I'll be erased just like Senior Fellow S was...!)]
377: 3842| [45] [Regardless, Ukita turned around and glared at LABO's gargantuan shadow.]
378: 3847| [45] [Cold rain suddenly poured down and crashed upon him.]
379: 3853| [45] [But the flame that had been lit in the depths of his heart would never go out.]
