  0:    8| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 7]
  1:   29| [45] [--And thus began that curious cyclic recursion of reminiscence and reality.]
  2:   34| [45] [After a vivid recollection of the events of September 10, Natsuhiko woke up--]
  3:   39| [45] [Natsuhiko told Mashiro and Salyu how he had met up with Yuuri.]
  4:  142| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  145| [45] ["... Now that it's come to it, let's take Yuuri with us so all four of us can escape together!"]
  6:  186| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  189| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
  8:  197| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  200| [45] ["Salyu, did the Area 1 elevator look functional?"]
 10:  226| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  229| [45] ["Unfortunately not. Looks like the elevators are out of service."]
 12:  255| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  258| [45] ["Our only escape route is to find a safe emergency staircase."]
 14:  266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  269| [45] ["Let's go, then! Area 2's up ahead!"]
 16:  368| [45] [Natsuhiko ran off with the girls.]
 17:  459| [45] [But their path was blocked by a security gate.]
 18:  464| [45] [In front of the closed gate, Natsuhiko recalled the events of the 11th.]
 19:  590| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  593| [45] ["What do you mean, 'come again?' You told me to show you my hand, remember?"]
 21:  686| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  689| [45] ["Do you agree 'BC is dangerous if handled improperly'?"]
 23:  767| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  770| [45] ["... What are you talking about? I'm just copying what you did back in the day."]
 25:  848| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  851| [45] ["I was sent here to protect you, after all."]
 27:  974| [45] [--At the end of that reminiscence, Natsuhiko returned to reality once more.]
 28: 1069| [45] [They pried the gate open and dashed into Area 2 where they came across men in protection suits.]
 29: 1074| [45] [For a second, they had thought that the rescue squad had come to save them--]
 30: 1122| [45] [But Salyu flung the men to the ground.]
 31: 1229| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 32: 1232| [45] ["Ghh!"]
 33: 1348| [47] [Mashiro]
 34: 1351| [45] ["Salyu, why...!?"]
 35: 1377| [47] [Salyu]
 36: 1380| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Mashiro. You guys are too soft... You let your guards down too quick."]
 37: 1388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38: 1391| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 39: 1417| [47] [Salyu]
 40: 1420| [45] ["Why are you so quick to trust people?"]
 41: 1425| [45] [For a moment, Natsuhiko had no idea what was happening-- but then he recalled what happened on the 12th.]
 42: 1547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43: 1550| [45] ["... That same dream again..."]
 44: 1627| [47] [Ena]
 45: 1630| [45] ["What we see isn't everything, and everything we see isn't necessarily real."]
 46: 1707| [47] [Mashiro]
 47: 1710| [45] ["If it's all true, that means the world I see and the world you see could actually be completely different, doesn't it?"]
 48: 1787| [47] [Salyu]
 49: 1790| [45] ["It looked to me like everyone had fun today. Did you have fun, Natsuhiko?"]
 50: 2027| [45] [--Once he saw those memories, Natsuhiko understood Salyu's intention.]
 51: 2032| [45] [Those were memories of the day they made friends with Salyu. And she wouldn't knock out rescue squad members without a good reason.]
 52: 2037| [45] [In other words, the men inside those protection suits were the terrorists they were looking for.]
 53: 2105| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 54: 2108| [45] ["... You'd have been better off not noticing that...!"]
 55: 2114| [45] [The terrorist slowly rose to his feet as he spoke.]
 56: 2147| [45] [As the others in the group stiffened up, Salyu yelled.]
 57: 2365| [47] [Salyu]
 58: 2368| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Mashiro! Run!"]
 59: 2376| [47] [Salyu]
 60: 2379| [45] ["I'll get rid of him! The other one's fainted, so I can manage one-on-one combat!"]
 61: 2405| [47] [Salyu]
 62: 2408| [45] ["You guys go find an exit! If you find one, contact me through telepathy!"]
 63: 2413| [45] [Natsuhiko hesitated, but what Salyu said was right.]
 64: 2421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 2424| [45] ["Salyu, it's a promise! We -will- get out of here-- together!"]
 66: 2450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 2453| [45] ["We'll find an exit and wait for you, okay!?"]
 68: 2458| [45] [Natsuhiko turned and fled with Yuuri and Mashiro.]
 69: 2690| [45] [They slipped through the passageway,]
 70: 2832| [45] [and headed to the emergency staircase in Area 3's inner ring--]
 71: 3006| [45] [But even the once-safe staircase was now blown up and rendered unusable.]
 72: 3011| [45] [If they couldn't find an exit, should they rejoin with Salyu and help her fight the terrorists?]
 73: 3016| [45] [Once that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Yuuri raised her voice.]
 74: 3100| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 3103| [45] ["No! Hikorin, remember what it is you need to do!"]
 76: 3111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 3114| [45] ["!?"]
 78: 3122| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 3125| [45] ["What is your duty!? There's something you need to do first, remember!?"]
 80: 3151| [47] [Yuuri]
 81: 3154| [45] ["I thought I told you back on that day too."]
 82: 3159| [45] [The moment she told him that, he recalled the events of the 13th.]
 83: 3328| [47] [Mashiro]
 84: 3331| [45] ["You're late, Natsuhiko. I've already finished preparing breakfast, too."]
 85: 3408| [47] [Ena]
 86: 3411| [45] ["All of your thoughts, intentions, feelings, and memories are more than just conceptual existences."]
 87: 3504| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 3507| [45] ["There's apparently been an increase in those that harbor anti-Communicator sentiments in town lately."]
 89: 3586| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 3589| [45] ["S-so... We're the only ones who've noticed this, aren't we?"]
 91: 3597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 3600| [45] ["There's nothing we can do to 'thwart' him, is there?"]
 93: 3677| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 3680| [45] ["I can't count on you for anything anymore, Natsuhiko! Goodbye!"]
 95: 3862| [45] [--That reminiscence taught Natsuhiko what it was that he should do right now.]
 96: 3867| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't believe Mashiro when she first talked about the terrorist plot. The current situation was the result of his disbelief.]
 97: 3872| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 3873| [45] [(Then what I need to do first... is to get Mashiro and the others out of here!)]
 99: 3878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 3879| [45] [(Is there any way at all to climb this thing!? If I can at least get Mashiro and the others out, then--)]
101: 3884| [45] [But at that moment,]
102: 3986| [45] [a small figure appeared at the top of the stairs.]
103: 4017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 4020| [45] ["Salyu!"]
105: 4028| [47] [Salyu]
106: 4031| [45] ["... I'm sorry. It was an embarrassing defeat."]
107: 4075| [45] [Salyu was shot and wounded by the terrorists.]
108: 4080| [45] [There were at least three of them. They had incredible physiques and apparently even a gun.]
109: 4085| [45] ["All we can do is run" "Dr. Tenkawa already managed to escape"%NAs Salyu reassured him, Natsuhiko called out to her.]
110: 4093| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 4096| [45] ["Okay, Salyu, then come down here! Let's escape together!"]
112: 4143| [47] [Salyu]
113: 4146| [45] ["No, I can't climb down with this arm. I think it'd be difficult for you guys to climb up too."]
114: 4154| [47] [Salyu]
115: 4157| [45] ["So let's split up and escape separately."]
116: 4165| [47] [Mashiro]
117: 4168| [45] ["No! Will you be okay by yourself, Salyu!?"]
118: 4176| [47] [Salyu]
119: 4179| [45] ["I will. But there's no time to speak my reasoning."]
120: 4187| [47] [Salyu]
121: 4190| [45] ["So let's use BC."]
122: 4198| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 4201| [45] ["!?"]
124: 4206| [45] [Once she said that, Natsuhiko used empathy right away.]
125: 4211| [45] [And soon enough, Salyu's mental voice echoed in Natsuhiko's head.]
126: 4216| [45] [--Her clear, high-speed thought process allowed her to convey everything to them.]
127: 4221| [45] [In a matter of mere moments.]
128: 4279| [85] [{It seems they have abandoned all efforts to maintain appearances.]
129: 4281| [85] [I believe that the next time we come across them, they'll shoot us on sight.}]
130: 4282| [86] [Salyu]
131: 4283| [86] [{It seems they have abandoned all efforts to maintain appearances. I believe that the next time we come across them, they'll shoot us on sight.}]
132: 4298| [85] [{Our chances of escape in these circumstances are unclear.]
133: 4300| [85] [But I'll ensure our escape despite the odds.}]
134: 4301| [86] [Salyu]
135: 4302| [86] [{Our chances of escape in these circumstances are unclear. But I'll ensure our escape despite the odds.}]
136: 4319| [85] [{Because I still want to live with you all.}]
137: 4320| [86] [Salyu]
138: 4321| [86] [{Because I still want to live with you all.}]
139: 4336| [85] [{... This might be irrational of me--}]
140: 4337| [86] [Salyu]
141: 4338| [86] [{... This might be irrational of me--}]
142: 4355| [85] [{But when I think about living with you all, a strong will surges inside me.]
143: 4357| [85] [It even lets me forget about the pain in my arm.}]
144: 4358| [86] [Salyu]
145: 4359| [86] [{But when I think about living with you all, a strong will surges inside me. It even lets me forget about the pain in my arm.}]
146: 4374| [85] [{I've finally found life interesting for once.]
147: 4376| [85] [I don't want it to end like this.}]
148: 4377| [86] [Salyu]
149: 4378| [86] [{I've finally found life interesting for once. I don't want it to end like this.}]
150: 4499| [85] [{I truly enjoyed these past six days.}]
151: 4500| [86] [Salyu]
152: 4501| [86] [{I truly enjoyed these past six days.}]
153: 4516| [85] [{Natsuhiko, thank you for praising my cooking. It was the first time I had ever cooked.}]
154: 4517| [86] [Salyu]
155: 4518| [86] [{Natsuhiko, thank you for praising my cooking. It was the first time I had ever cooked.}]
156: 4535| [85] [{Mashiro, thank you for giving me this nickname.]
157: 4537| [85] [I really liked it.}]
158: 4538| [86] [Salyu]
159: 4539| [86] [{Mashiro, thank you for giving me this nickname. I really liked it.}]
160: 4556| [85] [{Yuuri, it's a little late now, but I wanted to know more about you.}]
161: 4557| [86] [Salyu]
162: 4558| [86] [{Yuuri, it's a little late now, but I wanted to know more about you.}]
163: 4573| [85] [{... These are my true feelings. What I've always wanted to tell you all.}]
164: 4574| [86] [Salyu]
165: 4575| [86] [{... These are my true feelings. What I've always wanted to tell you all.}]
166: 4608| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 7]
167: 4669| [85] [{If I had one wish, it would be to have another meal at that house.}]
168: 4670| [86] [Salyu]
169: 4671| [86] [{If I had one wish, it would be to have another meal at that house.}]
170: 4686| [85] [{And by then, I'm sure I could make food that's even more delicious, so...}]
171: 4687| [86] [Salyu]
172: 4688| [86] [{And by then, I'm sure I could make food that's even more delicious, so...}]
173: 4716| [45] [She got that far with her thoughts before stopping with a faint smile.]
174: 4724| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 4727| [45] ["Salyu...!"]
176: 4732| [45] [Something warm filled Natsuhiko's chest.]
177: 4737| [45] [Yuuri and Mashiro murmured in trembling voices.]
178: 4745| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 4748| [45] ["Salyu..."]
180: 4756| [47] [Mashiro]
181: 4759| [45] ["Me too, Salyu...!"]
182: 4764| [45] [Mashiro-- and perhaps Yuuri-- seemed to have read Salyu's mind.]
183: 4769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 4770| [45] [(She was really that thankful for such a small gesture...!?)]
185: 4775| [45] [Salyu's feelings were so innocent that he didn't want to part with her.]
186: 4780| [45] [But nevertheless, Natsuhiko forced himself to smile as he called out to her.]
187: 4788| [47] [Natsuhiko]
188: 4791| [45] ["... Okay! Leave these two to me!"]
189: 4799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 4802| [45] ["Promise me one more thing! That we'll all live long enough to meet again on the outside!"]
191: 4810| [47] [Salyu]
192: 4813| [45] ["... Promise."]
193: 4856| [45] [And with that, Salyu disappeared.]
194: 4918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 4921| [45] ["... Let's go, you two. We need to keep our promise to Salyu."]
196: 4926| [45] [Mashiro and Yuuri nodded meekly.]
197: 4931| [45] [And then they ran once again.]
198: 5031| [45] [--The broadcast had said that the staircases in Areas 5 and 6 were safe.]
199: 5036| [45] [But once they left Area 3 and approached Area 4's outer ring--]
200: 5222| [45] [They found it wreathed in flames.]
201: 5227| [45] [They somehow managed to pass through and reach the next connecting passageway, but--]
202: 5442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 5445| [45] ["!!"]
204: 5450| [45] [--there was yet another fire blocking their way.]
205: 5455| [45] [The terrorists were chasing from behind. There was no escape.]
206: 5460| [45] [As they fell into despair, visions of the 14th suddenly flickered before Natsuhiko's eyes.]
207: 5597| [47] [Male Teacher]
208: 5600| [45] ["We've just received a report that a dangerous object was set inside school grounds...!"]
209: 5694| [47] [Mashiro]
210: 5697| [45] ["You guys believe me, right...?"]
211: 5758| [47] [Security Guard]
212: 5761| [45] ["Well, I've heard that unrest has been spreading through this whole town lately."]
213: 5821| [47] [Security Dept.]
214: 5824| [45] ["There they are! After them!"]
215: 5917| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 5920| [45] ["Okay, if all three of us give it our best, then there's nothing to be scared of!"]
217: 6114| [45] [--Those were the memories of the day Natsuhiko's daily life collapsed.]
218: 6119| [45] [That was the day there was a bomb threat at school. They heard about Q. They trespassed into the PRC. They got chased by the security department...]
219: 6124| [45] [And finally, that was the day he swore to protect the town with Mashiro and Salyu.]
220: 6129| [45] [He swore to protect it even if it meant having to be away from Yuuri.]
221: 6167| [45] [But in the end, Yuuri still got dragged into the affair, and was now standing in front of Natsuhiko.]
222: 6172| [45] [That day inspired Natsuhiko. Both through the regret he had for getting the girls involved and through the courage those girls had given him.]
223: 6260| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 6263| [45] ["... Hey, Hikorin. Think hard about the path you should take."]
225: 6268| [45] [Those words fanned the fire burning in Natsuhiko's heart.]
226: 6273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 6274| [45] [(That's right. I need to be stronger...)]
228: 6279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 6280| [45] [(Or else I have no hope of overcoming the past!)]
230: 6285| [45] [Natsuhiko grabbed Mashiro by the hand.]
231: 6293| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 6296| [45] ["Don't give up...! Let's go, Mashiro!"]
233: 6333| [47] [Mashiro]
234: 6336| [45] ["Huh? Wh-where!?"]
235: 6344| [47] [Natsuhiko]
236: 6347| [45] ["Let's take a different path! This isn't the only way to Area 5!"]
237: 6352| [45] [Inspired by the memory of that long day, Natsuhiko took Yuuri and Mashiro and ran.]
238: 6453| [45] [They slipped once again through the roaring flames enveloping Area 4,]
239: 6516| [45] [and took an alternate route to Area 5.]
240: 6568| [45] [But as soon as they set foot there, a warning rang out.]
241: 6573| [47] [Automatic PA]
242: 6576| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
243: 6581| [47] [Automatic PA]
244: 6584| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
245: 6589| [47] [Automatic PA]
246: 6592| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
247: 6597| [47] [Automatic PA]
248: 6600| [45] ["All facility personnel, please administer AD, take shelter in the nearest room, and stay in place."]
249: 6716| [45] [And with that automated broadcast, the security gates shut down.]
250: 6788| [47] [Mashiro]
251: 6791| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this!?"]
252: 6799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 6802| [45] ["We've been locked inside the building...!"]
254: 6807| [45] [There appeared to be no exits anywhere.]
255: 6812| [45] [In a daze, Natsuhiko's mind suddenly recalled his memories of the 15th.]
256: 6964| [47] [Mashiro]
257: 6967| [45] ["Ready guys? I'm ready when you are."]
258: 7164| [85] [{But until all the work is complete, it'd be best if I avoided him...}]
259: 7165| [86] [Miyoko]
260: 7166| [86] [{But until all the work is complete, it'd be best if I avoided him...}]
261: 7283| [47] [Mashiro]
262: 7286| [45] ["Number 5: 'If a Communicator uses BC without knowing the proper way, they will eventually turn into a mind-broken monster.'"]
263: 7365| [47] [Ena]
264: 7368| [45] ["It's a national fortress established by the state to protect Communicators like you."]
265: 7461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
266: 7464| [45] ["The incidents aren't over yet...!?"]
267: 7572| [47] [Jun]
268: 7575| [45] ["There's been such a spike in the sheer number of incidents alone that it just feels unnatural."]
269: 7805| [85] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
270: 7806| [86] [Ukita]
271: 7807| [86] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
272: 7895| [47] [Man 3]
273: 7898| [45] ["... Self-righteousness just leads to self-destruction."]
274: 7906| [47] [Man 3]
275: 7909| [45] ["Let's just put you kids to sleep for now."]
276: 8097| [45] [Those were memories of the day Natsuhiko found the truth and truly began to face his past.]
277: 8102| [45] [The day Ena told them about the true history of their country and the details of the organization known as Q.]
278: 8107| [45] [The day they caught the culprit behind the PRC bombing and learned that LABO was the next target--]
279: 8112| [45] [And finally, the day they finally confronted the terrorists but were defeated.]
280: 8117| [45] [The resentment, anger, and bitterness he felt that day rose once again in his heart.]
281: 8122| [47] [Natsuhiko]
282: 8123| [45] [(That's right... that was only a few hours ago, wasn't it?)]
283: 8128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
284: 8129| [45] [(The regret I felt back then brought me here--)]
285: 8134| [45] [As that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Yuuri softly whispered beside him.]
286: 8195| [47] [Yuuri]
287: 8198| [45] ["... Hikorin, you've remembered, haven't you?"]
288: 8206| [47] [Yuuri]
289: 8209| [45] ["You've overcome several obstacles to get here..."]
290: 8235| [47] [Yuuri]
291: 8238| [45] ["You've obtained the strength you need to overcome the past."]
292: 8246| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 8249| [45] ["No matter what happens from now on, your mind will endure. You should be able to overcome anything."]
294: 8254| [45] [Those words fortified Natsuhiko's mind even further.]
295: 8303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
296: 8306| [45] ["Mashiro, we can't give up yet. There has to be a way out."]
297: 8332| [47] [Mashiro]
298: 8335| [45] ["B-but we can't go anywhere because the gate won't open..."]
299: 8343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 8346| [45] ["No..."]
301: 8354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
302: 8357| [45] ["We'll search for a security card. As long as we have the right card, we can go to Area 6."]
303: 8362| [45] [Right after the alarm went off, the whole facility went into mass panic.]
304: 8367| [45] [It wouldn't be strange if a staff member had forgotten their card somewhere.]
305: 8372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 8373| [45] [(I swear I'll find a card... and get these two girls out of here if it's the last thing I do!)]
307: 8378| [45] [Natsuhiko held that conviction and began the search for a security card.]
308: 8426| [45] [--And thus, as reminiscence and reality converged, Natsuhiko progressed bit by bit.]
309: 8431| [45] [And in the room he arrived in, Natsuhiko discovered a certain something.]
310: 8518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
311: 8521| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
312: 8529| [47] [Natsuhiko]
313: 8532| [45] ["Why's there a picture of me here...!?"]
314: 8537| [45] [He also found a file labeled with the year "2021".]
315: 8542| [45] [Without thinking, he took it down and starting turning through it.]
316: 8547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
317: 8548| [45] [(The answer just might be in here...!)]
318: 8553| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed his mind, he felt someone's presence.]
319: 8642| [45] [He looked up in shock to find Yuuri standing by the room's entrance.]
320: 8656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
321: 8659| [45] ["... Yuuri...!"]
322: 8685| [47] [Natsuhiko]
323: 8688| [45] ["Did you send me into this room because you knew about this!?"]
324: 8714| [47] [Yuuri]
325: 8717| [45] ["Did I send you...? No, Hikorin, you chose this room yourself."]
326: 8743| [47] [Yuuri]
327: 8746| [45] ["We came into this room nine years ago too, didn't we? To escape the fire and the smoke..."]
328: 8754| [47] [Yuuri]
329: 8757| [45] ["You couldn't find a card back then. But this time, you can find one for sure."]
330: 8783| [47] [Yuuri]
331: 8786| [45] ["Look for it... and escape with Mashiron."]
332: 8794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
333: 8797| [45] ["With Mashiro...? What about you, Yuuri?"]
334: 8823| [47] [Yuuri]
335: 8826| [45] ["I can't go with you."]
336: 8834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 8837| [45] ["Why not!?"]
338: 8863| [47] [Yuuri]
339: 8866| [45] ["Haven't you realized it already?"]
340: 8892| [47] [Yuuri]
341: 8895| [45] ["... Hikorin, try to remember what it was you saw and heard today."]
342: 8903| [47] [Yuuri]
343: 8906| [45] ["For the truth lies in those observations..."]
344: 8911| [45] [The moment Yuuri said that,]
345: 8916| [45] [Natsuhiko realized something.]
346: 8921| [47] [Natsuhiko]
347: 8922| [45] [(Ah...!?)]
348: 8927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
349: 8928| [45] [(She already said that "just now"...!)]
350: 8933| [45] [Indeed-- Natsuhiko had recalled everything that happened up to that very moment.]
351: 8938| [45] [He had recalled all his memories this morning from waking up in the ruined factory to entering this very room--]
352: 9013| [47] [Natsuhiko]
353: 9014| [45] [(...!)]
354: 9082| [45] [--At the end of his long reminiscence, time had caught up with reality.]
355: 9087| [45] [And at the same time--]
356: 9092| [45] [An intense anxiety welled up from within him.]
357: 9123| [47] [Natsuhiko]
358: 9124| [45] [(Wh... what is this...!?)]
359: 9129| [45] [It wasn't because he had kept recalling things.]
360: 9134| [45] [While that was indeed strange and he didn't know why it was happening--%Nthere was something far stranger.]
361: 9139| [45] [In his memories of just a few hours ago, something felt bizarrely out of place.]
362: 9144| [45] [Earlier, when Yuuri said "the truth lies in those observations", it sent intense tremors in Natsuhiko's mind.]
363: 9175| [47] [Natsuhiko]
364: 9176| [45] [(Strange... Something's strange...!)]
365: 9181| [45] [His headache got even worse.]
366: 9186| [45] [It gave him the feeling that he mustn't think any further about that matter.]
367: 9230| [45] [However-- Natsuhiko's gaze fell onto the file in his hands.]
368: 9235| [45] [The file labeled "2021" that was in his mother's care.]
369: 9240| [45] [He flipped through the chronologically organized documents.]
370: 9245| [45] [And eventually--]
371: 9253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
372: 9256| [45] ["!!"]
373: 9261| [45] [One page in particular caught Natsuhiko's eye.]
374: 9266| [45] [The paper was dated July 7, 2021.]
375: 9271| [45] [The day Natsuhiko and Yuuri got caught in an accident--]
376: 9276| [45] [The page contained clippings of newspaper articles.]
377: 9353| [45] ["Fire at Nuclear Research Facility" July 7, 2021]
378: 9356| [85] [ã€€]
379: 9359| [45] [Today at 1 PM, a fire broke out at Rokumei City's nuclear research facility,%N"the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization".]
380: 9362| [45] [Fifteen staff members and children were hospitalized for burns and carbon monoxide poisoning.%NIn addition, there was one casualty.]
381: 9365| [45] [The name of the deceased was Koki Sumida (36), a staff member at the facility.]
382: 9368| [45] [Sumida suffered full body burns and died shortly after he was rescued and taken outside the facility.]
383: 9371| [45] [The disaster developed to the point where two other children were rendered unconscious and are in critical condition.]
384: 9374| [45] [The facility announced that their small nuclear reactor intended for research was in use, but the effects of the fire pose no danger of causing radiation leakage.]
385: 9377| [45] [The cause of the fire is unknown, but police officials are investigating the possibility of arson.]
386: 9433| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart throbbed in pain as he finished reading the article.]
387: 9438| [45] [He had a terribly bad feeling about the next document, but still he flipped the page.]
388: 9443| [45] [Next was what appeared to be an internal LABO document concerning the incident.]
389: 9520| [45] ["LABO Fire Incident" July 10th, 2021]
390: 9523| [85] [ã€€]
391: 9526| [45] [All relevant parties are most likely already aware of the fire that occurred in this facility three days ago (July 7, 2021).]
392: 9529| [45] [Although the worst possible outcome was averted at the last moment, there were inadequacies found in multiple security systems.]
393: 9532| [45] [This document contains a compilation of the problems hinted at by this incident.]
394: 9535| [45] [The cause of the fire lies in the deranged actions of Senior Fellow S.]
395: 9538| [45] [S had been appointed as an administrator of Area Zero on April 12.]
396: 9541| [45] [As a result, he had quite a great number of opportunities to come into contact with the research results in Area Zero.]
397: 9545| [45] [And about three months later, S committed his crime.]
398: 9548| [45] [He took the power generator gasoline stored in Area Zero%Nand scattered it at six points throughout LABO.]
399: 9551| [45] [He used timed lighters to set them all on fire and intentionally caused the WX particle amplifier to go haywire at the same time.]
400: 9554| [45] [He also unlocked the gates to Area N and Area Zero.]
401: 9557| [45] [He is believed to have committed the arson in order to escape with certain research results during the fire.]
402: 9560| [45] [Though this is nothing more than a guess, seeing as how S is now dead, the possibility of this is quite high.]
403: 9563| [45] [(Furthermore, these research results shall be designated as "N" amongst all Senior Fellows%Nto conceal the relevant details.)]
404: 9567| [45] [Also, while this is not directly related to the incident, two children infiltrated the facility on the day of the incident at a most unfortunate time.]
405: 9570| [45] [It is simply unacceptable for children to have found and exploited a hole in our security.]
406: 9573| [45] [This is quite frankly the epitome of carelessness for our security systems.]
407: 9576| [45] [And two lives were lost as a result.]
408: 9579| [45] [We must all learn a lesson from this incident.]
409: 9582| [45] [Strengthening Area Zero's security alone doesn't guarantee us any safety whatsoever.]
410: 9585| [45] [There is an urgent need to have the specifications of a Case N reviewed and for the security systems to be enhanced.]
411: 9588| [45] [Otherwise, we may foresee yet another repeat of this tragedy.]
412: 9591| [85] [ã€€]
413: 9594| [45] [--6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization Security Chief Isao Kawada--]
414: 9624| [45] [The more he continued reading, the more Natsuhiko's heart pounded like an alarm bell.]
415: 9632| [47] [Natsuhiko]
416: 9635| [45] ["Huh... ah..."]
417: 9640| [45] [The document was littered with initialisms and cryptic terminology, but there was one thing he could understand clearly:]
418: 9645| [45] [The cause of the incident that Natsuhiko and Yuuri had encountered--]
419: 9650| [45] [--was arson committed by a facility staff member.]
420: 9655| [47] [Natsuhiko]
421: 9656| [45] [(The incident nine years ago and the incident today were no accidents...!)]
422: 9661| [47] [Natsuhiko]
423: 9662| [45] [(So is that why there've been so many coincidences...!?)]
424: 9667| [45] [But there was a far more important detail in the document.]
425: 9672| [45] ["Two lives were lost as a result."]
426: 9677| [45] [Natsuhiko felt an absurd anxiety over those words.]
427: 9682| [45] [--One of the ones who died nine years ago was the arsonist, "Senior Fellow S".]
428: 9687| [45] [Then who was the other life lost--?]
429: 9692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
430: 9693| [45] [(... It can't be...)]
431: 9698| [47] [Natsuhiko]
432: 9699| [45] [(It can't be!!)]
433: 9704| [45] [Voices echoed inside his head telling him%N"Stop"%N"Don't read any more".]
434: 9709| [45] [An unbearable pain ran through his head.]
435: 9714| [45] [But Natsuhiko shook it off--]
436: 9719| [45] [And turned the page.]
437: 9796| [45] [%N"Victim Count Rises for Nuclear Research Facility Fire" July 9, 2021]

440: 9805| [45] [nuclear research facility, the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization", another casualty was confirmed.]
441: 9808| [45] [The deceased child was Yuuri Kotono (8).]
442: 9811| [45] [At the time of the incident, Yuuri was sent to a city hospital unconscious and in critical condition.]
443: 9814| [45] [She was put under intensive care but never regained consciousness.%NShe passed away in the early hours of the morning.]
444: 9817| [45] [Yuuri's cause of death was multiple organ failure due to carbon monoxide poisoning.]
445: 9820| [45] [According to both the facility and the hospital, her illness was not due to radiation exposure.]
446: 9826| [85] [ã€€]

454: 9893| [45] [A moan squeezed out from the bottom of his throat.]
455: 9898| [45] [A single line from the article jumped out and bore its way forcefully into his eyes.]

470: 10142| [45] ["Ahh, Agh, Aaaagghhhh....!"]
471: 10147| [45] [His body trembled.]
472: 10152| [45] [He couldn't think. He couldn't understand.]
473: 10157| [45] [But soon enough, in the depths of that white darkness,]
474: 10162| [45] [the memories of nine years ago--]
475: 10167| [45] [--came rushing back to Natsuhiko.]
476: 10321| [47] [Yuuri]

481: 10346| [45] ["Y-yeah...!"]
482: 10351| [45] [Yuuri answered with painful breaths.]
483: 10356| [45] [--That day, Natsuhiko and Yuuri had trespassed all the way to B1 Area 5.]
484: 10361| [45] [But once they got there, the path was a sea of fire.]
485: 10366| [45] [Flames danced about everywhere, shrouding the facility in smoke.]
486: 10371| [45] [They didn't seem to have very long before they'd be surrounded by fire.]
487: 10376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
488: 10377| [45] [(Wh-what do we do...? At this rate, Yuuri's gonna...!)]
489: 10382| [45] [They searched everywhere in Area 5, but they could not find Natsuhiko's mother.]
490: 10387| [45] [Perhaps she had already escaped without waiting for them.]
491: 10392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
492: 10393| [45] [(In that case, we have to hurry and get out of here...!)]
493: 10398| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind--]
494: 10414| [45] [--an ominous siren suddenly bellowed.]
495: 10440| [47] [Yuuri]
496: 10443| [45] ["Hweh!?"]
497: 10451| [47] [Natsuhiko]
498: 10454| [45] ["Wh-what!? What's that sound--"]
499: 10459| [45] [A loud alarm bellowed, much different from the siren of the fire alarm.]
500: 10464| [45] [An automatic broadcast voice followed.]
501: 10470| [47] [Automatic PA]
502: 10473| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
503: 10478| [47] [Automatic PA]

507: 10494| [47] [Automatic PA]
508: 10497| [45] ["All facility personnel, please administer AD, take shelter in the nearest room, and stay in place."]
509: 10502| [45] [The broadcast said nothing more before cutting out.]
510: 10507| [45] [Natsuhiko looked toward the connecting passageway in shock.]
511: 10638| [45] [The security gate in their path shut with a roar.]
512: 10646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
513: 10649| [45] ["Ah!"]
514: 10654| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed over to the gate and tried opening it.]
515: 10659| [45] [But no matter how much strength he used, no matter how much he pressed the open button, the gate wouldn't budge one bit.]
516: 10667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
517: 10670| [45] ["Wh-why...!?"]
518: 10696| [47] [Yuuri]
519: 10699| [45] ["H-Hikorin... what's wrong...?"]
520: 10704| [45] [With a worried look on her face, Yuuri gripped Natsuhiko's hand tight.]
521: 10709| [45] [Natsuhiko answered tearfully.]
522: 10717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
523: 10720| [45] ["I-I don't know why..."]
524: 10728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
525: 10731| [45] ["But the door won't open anymore!"]
526: 10757| [47] [Yuuri]
527: 10760| [45] ["--!"]
528: 10768| [47] [Yuuri]
529: 10771| [45] ["Y-you mean we can't get out...?"]
530: 10779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
531: 10782| [45] ["I-it's okay! I'll open this dumb thing up right now!"]
532: 10808| [45] [Natsuhiko fired himself up and struck the door with all his might.]
533: 10813| [45] [But as he did, smoke billowed up from somewhere and flooded the surrounding air.]
534: 10839| [47] [Yuuri]
535: 10842| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
536: 10853| [45] [Natsuhiko panicked as he heard Yuuri's coughing.]
537: 10858| [45] [But no matter how many times he pounded on the door, it wouldn't open.]
538: 10867| [47] [Natsuhiko]
539: 10870| [45] ["Darn it! Why won't it open!"]
540: 10896| [47] [Yuuri]
541: 10899| [45] ["*sob* ... *sob* ..."]
542: 10907| [47] [Yuuri]
543: 10910| [45] ["Wh-what do we do, Hikorin... I'm scared...!"]
544: 10918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
545: 10921| [45] ["Don't cry, Yuuri! I'll do something!"]
546: 10932| [45] [As he screamed with his wavering voice, Natsuhiko pounded recklessly on the gate.]
547: 10940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
548: 10943| [45] ["Uugh... uugh...!"]
549: 10949| [45] [Tears welled up in Natsuhiko's eyes. Tears of fear. Tears of pain from slamming the gate with his fists.]
550: 10975| [47] [Yuuri]
551: 10978| [45] ["*cough* ... *cough* ...!"]
552: 10986| [47] [Yuuri]
553: 10989| [45] ["..."]
554: 10994| [45] [Eventually Yuuri's coughing started to grow weak.]
555: 11002| [47] [Natsuhiko]
556: 11005| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...!"]
557: 11046| [47] [Yuuri]
558: 11049| [45] ["Ugh..."]
559: 11054| [45] [When he turned around, Yuuri had sunk to the floor.]
560: 11059| [47] [Natsuhiko]
561: 11060| [45] [(If we stay here, Yuuri's gonna die...!)]
562: 11065| [45] [Natsuhiko carried Yuuri's body and slowly started to walk.]
563: 11070| [45] [His head hurt terribly, perhaps due to smoke inhalation.]
564: 11075| [45] [He was sick to his stomach and his skin felt numb.]
565: 11080| [45] [But even so, he desperately searched for a route to survival--]
566: 11177| [45] [But he couldn't find an exit anywhere.]
567: 11182| [45] [Their sole path to escape, the emergency staircase, was engulfed in flames, preventing any possible approach.]
568: 11227| [45] [They tumbled into a nearby room, chased by the smoke.]
569: 11232| [45] [They desperately shut the door, but the smoke got in through the gaps.]
570: 11297| [47] [Yuuri]
571: 11300| [45] ["... *cough*..."]
572: 11305| [45] [Yuuri coughed within Natsuhiko's arms.]
573: 11310| [45] [Her powerless voice tore at Natsuhiko's heart.]
574: 11315| [45] [--There was nowhere to run.]
575: 11320| [45] [The fire intensified and the smoke chased them everywhere.]
576: 11325| [45] [This small room too would eventually be engulfed in flames.]
577: 11330| [45] [Even as a young child, Natsuhiko knew. He knew that death was near.]
578: 11338| [47] [Natsuhiko]
579: 11341| [45] ["Ugh... Uuugh...!"]
580: 11346| [45] [He sobbed words of regret.]
581: 11354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
582: 11357| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri... it's all because I took you with me..."]
583: 11380| [47] [Yuuri]
584: 11381| [45] ["..."]
585: 11389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
586: 11392| [45] ["I tried to act cool and say I'd save Mom..."]
587: 11400| [47] [Natsuhiko]
588: 11403| [45] ["But I couldn't, and now I got you trapped in this mess..."]
589: 11411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
590: 11414| [45] ["I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...!"]
591: 11419| [45] [Before he knew it, tears were dripping out of his eyes.]
592: 11424| [45] [His body withered in helplessness. His heart tore apart with regret.]
593: 11429| [45] [But then-- Yuuri's hand touched Natsuhiko's cheek.]
594: 11455| [47] [Yuuri]
595: 11458| [45] ["... It's okay, Hikorin..."]
596: 11466| [47] [Yuuri]
597: 11469| [45] ["It's because you're always trying your hardest, for everyone else..."]
598: 11477| [47] [Yuuri]
599: 11480| [45] ["I loved that about you..."]
600: 11506| [47] [Yuuri]
601: 11509| [45] ["So I'm glad... that you stayed with me... until the end."]
602: 11514| [45] [As she spoke, she smiled.]
603: 11519| [45] [A smile with but a fraction of the brightness of a sixth magnitude star.]
604: 11527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
605: 11530| [45] ["Yuuri...!"]
606: 11571| [45] [Natsuhiko embraced Yuuri.]
607: 11576| [45] [Her body was powerless. He was afraid that she'd collapse if he let go.]
608: 11581| [45] [The smoke snatched away Natsuhiko's strength as well, and it became difficult for him to support her.]
609: 11586| [45] [His consciousness threatened to fade away, but even so--]
610: 11591| [47] [Natsuhiko]
611: 11592| [45] [(... I can't give up...)]
612: 11597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
613: 11598| [45] [(I need to find a way to save Yuuri...!)]
614: 11603| [45] [Natsuhiko thought desperately.]
615: 11608| [45] [He searched around the room for a way to escape.]
616: 11613| [45] [And on top of the desk, he caught sight of a digital photo frame.]
617: 11618| [47] [Natsuhiko]
618: 11619| [45] [(...!)]
619: 11624| [45] [There was a picture of Natsuhiko and his mother.]
620: 11629| [47] [Natsuhiko]
621: 11630| [45] [(So this is Mom's room...!?)]
622: 11635| [45] [That tiniest bit of information sparked hope in Natsuhiko's heart.]
623: 11640| [45] [Within his arms, Yuuri's face was pale, her eyes closed.]
624: 11645| [45] [He remembered the days he had spent with her.]
625: 11650| [45] [How they had run around in the park, played at home, gone on tests of courage, and finally--]
626: 11655| [45] [How they had practiced telepathy together.]
627: 11660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
628: 11661| [45] [(... Telepathy...!)]
629: 11666| [47] [Natsuhiko]
630: 11667| [45] [(If I can use telepathy to tell someone we're here--)]
631: 11672| [47] [Natsuhiko]
632: 11673| [45] [(Then someone will come save us!!)]
633: 11723| [45] [Natsuhiko focused.]
634: 11728| [45] [He keened all his mind to the best of his ability.]
635: 11733| [45] [He focused on a distress signal.]
636: 11738| [45] [To survive. To save Yuuri.]
637: 11743| [45] [Eventually, all the surrounding sound faded into the distance--]
638: 11748| [45] [And his mental voice was sent free.]
639: 11756| [47] [Natsuhiko]
640: 11759| [45] [{Someone come save us!}]
641: 11767| [47] [Natsuhiko]
642: 11770| [45] [{We're in Dr. Tenkawa's room!}]
643: 11775| [45] [--That was the very first time he had used telepathy in his life.]
644: 11780| [45] [He had never used it before, but he had a feeling he had used it for sure.]
645: 11785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
646: 11786| [45] [(All right...! I'll send it over and over until it reaches someone...!)]
647: 11791| [45] [Natsuhiko kept using telepathy.]
648: 11796| [45] [His five senses dampened and he became unaware of the outside world.]
649: 11801| [45] [--Eventually, once Natsuhiko was near the limits of his ability to concentrate--]
650: 11806| [45] [He heard someone's voice.]
651: 11814| [47] [???]
652: 11817| [45] ["--hiko! Natsuhiko!"]
653: 11825| [47] [???]
654: 11828| [45] ["Ahh, Yuuri too...!"]
655: 11833| [45] [Natsuhiko snapped back to his senses and looked at the voice's owner.]
656: 11905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
657: 11908| [45] ["M-Mom...!"]
658: 11916| [47] [Miyoko]
659: 11919| [45] ["Thank goodness you're safe!"]
660: 11945| [47] [Miyoko]
661: 11948| [45] ["I came here to save you! Let's take Yuuri and get out of here!"]
662: 11956| [47] [Natsuhiko]
663: 11959| [45] ["Y-yeah...!"]
664: 11964| [45] [Natsuhiko whipped his numb body into shape and stood up.]
665: 11969| [45] [The professor carried the limp Yuuri and dashed out of the room.]
666: 12117| [45] [They ran through the smoke.]
667: 12125| [47] [Natsuhiko]
668: 12128| [45] ["I-is there an escape route...?"]
669: 12228| [47] [Miyoko]
670: 12231| [45] ["... It's okay. There's an emergency escape in Area 6."]
671: 12239| [47] [Miyoko]
672: 12242| [45] ["I swear I'll save you two... So relax."]
673: 12247| [45] [The professor's voice was seeping with determination.]
674: 12355| [45] [The professor ran through what looked like a blazing factory.]
675: 12360| [45] [And in the deepest part of the room, there was a security gate--%NShe ran up to it and took a card out of her pocket.]
676: 12365| [45] [She passed the card through the terminal on the side of the gate, and the gate opened.]
677: 12411| [45] [On the other side of the gate was a small room that looked like an elevator hall.]
678: 12473| [47] [Miyoko]
679: 12476| [45] ["This is a cargo lift..."]
680: 12484| [47] [Miyoko]
681: 12487| [45] ["It can't go down to the basement from the ground floors, but it should go up the other way,%Neven during incidents like these...!"]
682: 12498| [45] [The professor walked up to the control panel and operated it.]
683: 12524| [47] [Miyoko]
684: 12527| [45] ["Please work...!"]
685: 12532| [45] [She whispered as if in prayer, and eventually the lift door opened with a heavy sound.]
686: 12600| [47] [Miyoko]
687: 12603| [45] ["It worked...! We're saved!"]
688: 12636| [45] [They climbed into the lift.]
689: 12641| [45] [The professor laid Yuuri on the floor and closed the door using the control panel.]
690: 12646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
691: 12647| [45] [(... Thank goodness...!)]
692: 12680| [45] [And at the same time, as if his threads of tension had been cut--]
693: 12685| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness suddenly faded into the distance.]
694: 12739| [47] [Miyoko]
695: 12742| [45] ["...?"]
696: 12750| [47] [Miyoko]
697: 12753| [45] ["Natsuhiko!? What's wrong!? Natsuhiko!"]
698: 12758| [45] [Natsuhiko felt like he heard his mother's voice as his consciousness faded.]
699: 12763| [45] [------]
700: 12768| [45] [----]
701: 12773| [45] [--]
702: 12833| [45] [--After that, Natsuhiko awoke--]
703: 12841| [47] [Natsuhiko]
704: 12844| [45] ["... Ugh..."]
705: 12908| [45] [--to find himself in a hospital bed.]
706: 12971| [47] [Miyoko]
707: 12974| [45] ["Oh, you're awake! Thank goodness!"]
708: 12982| [47] [Natsuhiko]
709: 12985| [45] ["Ah... M-Mom."]
710: 12990| [45] [His usually calm and collected mother was, for that moment only, smiling joyfully.]
711: 13016| [47] [Miyoko]
712: 13019| [45] ["You were asleep for two days... I was so worried about you."]
713: 13027| [47] [Miyoko]
714: 13030| [45] ["But I'm truly glad that you're safe..."]
715: 13035| [45] [But-- Natsuhiko asked his mother a question with a hollow voice.]
716: 13043| [47] [Natsuhiko]
717: 13046| [45] ["Mom..."]
718: 13054| [47] [Natsuhiko]
719: 13057| [45] ["... How's Yuuri?"]
720: 13080| [45] [He couldn't see Yuuri anywhere.]
721: 13085| [45] [But the professor's smile froze at the question.]
722: 13111| [47] [Miyoko]
723: 13114| [45] ["Natsuhiko, please calm down and listen carefully..."]
724: 13119| [45] [She answered with a sunken expression on her face.]
725: 13127| [47] [Miyoko]
726: 13130| [45] ["Yuuri..."]
727: 13138| [47] [Miyoko]
728: 13141| [45] ["... Yuuri breathed her last breath last night..."]
729: 13149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
730: 13152| [45] ["... Huh?"]
731: 13157| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't understand a word the professor was saying.]
732: 13165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
733: 13168| [45] ["... No way."]
734: 13176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
735: 13179| [45] ["Why did Yuuri...!?"]
736: 13205| [47] [Miyoko]
737: 13208| [45] ["You see, Yuuri had a weak constitution..."]
738: 13216| [47] [Miyoko]
739: 13219| [45] ["She breathed in too much smoke, and in the end, she couldn't regain consciousness..."]
740: 13227| [47] [Miyoko]
741: 13230| [45] ["... And so, last night..."]
742: 13235| [45] [None of the words entered his head. He couldn't perceive any meaning.]
743: 13240| [45] [But bit by bit, the truth slowly soaked into Natsuhiko's mind.]
744: 13248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
745: 13251| [45] ["No way..."]
746: 13259| [47] [Natsuhiko]
747: 13262| [45] ["... Aah, aah..."]
748: 13270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
749: 13273| [45] ["... AaaaAAAHHHH!!"]
750: 13317| [45] [The young Natsuhiko's cries echoed through the hospital that night.]
