  0:   65| [45] [--It was a cold, gloomy room, almost like a prison.]
  1:   70| [45] [Salyu stood still in that room, thinking to herself. ]
  2:   75| [45] ["My entire world lies within this facility."]
  3:   80| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   81| [45] [(Facility...!?)]
  5:   86| [45] [That word triggered red flags in Natsuhiko's mind.]
  6:   91| [45] [When the door opened, it was not a tutor that entered the room--]
  7:  117| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  120| [45] ["Yui, come out."]
  9:  125| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  126| [45] [(!?)]
 11:  131| [45] [--but a woman Natsuhiko knew well.]
 12:  169| [47] [Miyoko]
 13:  172| [45] ["It's time for experiments."]
 14:  177| [45] [As Dr. Tenkawa entered the room, Salyu asked her a question.]
 15:  182| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  185| [45] ["Whose memory are we transferring today?"]
 17:  193| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  196| [45] ["Professor Emeritus Kagano, an authority on fluid mechanics."]
 19:  201| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  204| [45] ["Fluid mechanics. Not interested."]
 21:  230| [47] [Miyoko]
 22:  233| [45] ["You might actually find it interesting once you understand it, you know?"]
 23:  241| [47] [Miyoko]
 24:  244| [45] ["After all, it only takes a moment."]
 25:  249| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa was indeed right.]
 26:  254| [45] [Salyu nodded and followed her outside the room.]
 27:  358| [45] [Other researchers were waiting outside.]
 28:  363| [45] [They brought Salyu through the underground garden and stopped in front of Subject N's room.]
 29:  419| [45] [There, they blindfolded Salyu and bound her feet and hands.]
 30:  463| [45] [Beyond that door was "Subject N".]
 31:  468| [45] [Anyone who wanted to meet her had to be either completely bound or injected with AD.]
 32:  479| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa and the other researchers opened the door and brought Salyu into Subject N's room.]
 33:  503| [47] [Subject N]
 34:  506| [45] ["... Welcome back."]
 35:  511| [45] [They heard Subject N's voice.]
 36:  516| [45] [The researchers soon responded.]
 37:  521| [47] [Eriguchi]
 38:  524| [45] ["We're starting now, Subject N."]
 39:  529| [47] [Kashiwagi]
 40:  532| [45] ["Starting Memory Transfer Experiment Phase 2, Trial 316."]
 41:  537| [47] [Kashiwagi]
 42:  540| [45] ["From No. 3, Subject N, to No. 2, Subject Y. Begin Senses Sympathy."]
 43:  545| [47] [Subject N]
 44:  548| [45] ["Okay."]
 45:  560| [45] [And with that signal, a flood of "information" flowed into Salyu's head.]
 46:  572| [45] [It was the memory of the "fluid mechanics authority" or whomever it was that Dr. Tenkawa spoke about earlier.]
 47:  584| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  587| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 49:  592| [45] [Salyu groaned.]
 50:  597| [45] [Though it only took a moment each time, Salyu could never get used to that feeling.]
 51:  602| [45] [Even though it was only memories that were being written onto her brain, it felt like even her own mind was being rewritten.]
 52:  607| [47] [Subject N]
 53:  610| [45] ["--Done."]
 54:  615| [45] [But as soon as Subject N gave the word, the bizarre sensation faded.]
 55:  620| [47] [Eriguchi]
 56:  623| [45] ["Roger that. Now withdraw Subject Y."]
 57:  628| [45] [Salyu was then taken out of the room again.]
 58:  717| [45] [Once they were in the underground garden, Dr. Tenkawa took out her PDA and handed it over to Salyu.]
 59:  725| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  728| [45] ["Yui, try solving this problem for me."]
 61:  739| [45] [On her PDA screen was a problem relating to fluid mechanics.]
 62:  744| [45] ["In August 2015, a solid body flow pattern was confirmed near Jupiter's south pole.]
 63:  749| [45] [The following data table represents a two-dimensional model of that flow pattern.]
 64:  754| [45] [Based on the data, explain the mechanism behind the formation of the flow pattern."]
 65:  759| [47] [Salyu]
 66:  762| [45] ["Roger."]
 67:  773| [45] [Salyu took the PDA and smoothly solved the problem.]
 68:  779| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa looked at Salyu's solution and then spoke.]
 69:  805| [47] [Miyoko]
 70:  808| [45] ["Yes, that is correct."]
 71:  813| [47] [Salyu]
 72:  816| [45] ["Naturally."]
 73:  821| [45] [It was no surprise.]
 74:  826| [45] [For that problem itself was made by the very same fluid mechanics authority whose memory Salyu now had.]
 75:  831| [45] [Thus, there was no conceivable way Salyu would be unable to solve it.]
 76:  857| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  860| [45] ["Successful memory transfer confirmed. Memory Transfer Experiment Phase 2, Trial 316 complete."]
 78:  865| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa spoke those words into a voice recorder and then addressed Salyu.]
 79:  891| [47] [Miyoko]
 80:  894| [45] ["That finishes up your work for today. Let's head back to your room."]
 81:  899| [47] [Salyu]
 82:  902| [45] ["Understood."]
 83:  907| [45] [And with that answer, Dr. Tenkawa brought Salyu back to the room she started out in.]
 84:  912| [45] [This was Salyu's one and only unconditional "role".]
 85:  967| [45] [To be a part of LABO's 4 years and going "Memory Transfer Experiment".%NThe subject matter of the experiment was simple:]
 86:  972| [45] [First, LABO would invite "guests" with technical expertise to come to the facility.]
 87:  977| [45] [After putting a guest to sleep with drugs, they would quickly bring them to Subject N's room.]
 88:  982| [45] [There, Subject N would apply Senses Sympathy to steal all of the guest's knowledge.]
 89:  987| [45] [A skilled Level 6 Communicator is able to handle memories inside the human mind almost as if they were digital data.]
 90:  992| [45] [The Communicator could copy and paste the memories into their own mind, as well as bestow their own memories to a third party.]
 91:  997| [45] [Such tasks were easy, assuming one could manipulate intracerebral BC particles at will.]
 92: 1002| [45] [Furthermore, the entire process took only a negligible amount of time.]
 93: 1007| [45] [The guest would be left with a memory gap, but all Subject N had to do was fill it in with a fabricated memory.]
 94: 1012| [45] [Once the drugs wore off and the guest woke up, they would not remember a thing. They would not even be aware that anything had happened to them.]
 95: 1017| [45] [It was an extremely efficient, perfectly imperceptible theft of trade secrets.]
 96: 1022| [45] [The backbone of an industrial espionage effort created by LABO, Rokumei City, and a certain corporation.]
 97: 1027| [47] [Salyu]
 98: 1028| [45] [(It's a well-planned system...)]
 99: 1033| [45] [That was what Salyu thought.]
100: 1038| [45] [There were several ways of inviting the guests as well.]
101: 1043| [45] [Sometimes they'd be invited directly with made-up business. Sometimes they'd visit LABO of their own accord.]
102: 1048| [45] [Rokumei City Hospital was yet another entity in on the deal, and thus there were cases where they had drugged patients who had useful knowledge and transported them to LABO.]
103: 1053| [45] [Thus, LABO obtained knowledge from visiting guests and applied that knowledge for use in its own facility.]
104: 1058| [45] [In its greed, LABO also stole trade secrets that had no direct relation to BC in order to sell them off to other research facilities they had connections with.]
105: 1063| [45] [--Salyu's role was to be one of the final cogs in the process.]
106: 1068| [45] [All of the memories and knowledge Subject N stole from the guests were transcribed onto Salyu's brain.]
107: 1073| [45] [As a backup, so to speak.]
108: 1078| [45] [Salyu was thus a "spare brain" for Subject N.]
109: 1083| [45] [That said, Salyu didn't think much about it.]
110: 1088| [45] [She had already been burdened with that role for as long as she could remember.]
111: 1093| [45] [Just once or twice a week, the professor would come bring her to Subject N's room and back, just like today.]
112: 1098| [45] [And as long as she did that, she received all of her living necessities.]
113: 1103| [45] [All necessities except for freedom, that is.]
114: 1184| [47] [Miyoko]
115: 1187| [45] ["... Good work today."]
116: 1192| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa thanked her as always.]
117: 1197| [45] [But Salyu noticed her voice was just a little bit quieter than usual.]
118: 1202| [47] [Salyu]
119: 1205| [45] ["Professor, what's wrong?"]
120: 1231| [47] [Miyoko]
121: 1234| [45] ["It's nothing. I'm just a little tired. We've been busy recently, you see."]
122: 1239| [45] [Salyu was relieved. As long as the professor said so, it was probably just that.]
123: 1265| [47] [Miyoko]
124: 1268| [45] ["I'm sorry, but I've got matters to attend to, so I'll be going now. I'll show up again later."]
125: 1273| [47] [Salyu]
126: 1276| [45] ["When's the next appointment?"]
127: 1302| [47] [Miyoko]
128: 1305| [45] ["Hmm... it might not be for a while, actually."]
129: 1331| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1334| [45] ["Subject N hasn't been well lately."]
131: 1339| [47] [Salyu]
132: 1342| [45] ["I see."]
133: 1347| [45] [Salyu felt glad that she wouldn't have to deal with that troublesome sensation, but at the same time, she felt a little lonely that the appointments were diminishing.]
134: 1373| [47] [Miyoko]
135: 1376| [45] ["I'll be sure to tell you when an appointment's scheduled. See you later."]
136: 1433| [45] [And with that, the professor left the room.]
137: 1438| [45] [Salyu gazed at the shut door.]
138: 1443| [45] [As long as nobody opened that door from the outside, it would never open.]
139: 1448| [45] [Salyu thought she would have a bit of free time until the next time the professor came.]
140: 1494| [45] [--Salyu herself wasn't quite sure of how long this had continued.]
141: 1499| [45] [Such a trifling past had sunk to the bottom of her vast, oft-rewritten pool of knowledge.]
142: 1504| [45] [But what she did remember was that when she was younger, she had a different sort of role.]
143: 1509| [47] [Salyu]
144: 1510| [45] [(If I'm not mistaken, that was the experiment to inundate the body with WX particles...)]
145: 1569| [45] [In those experiments, Salyu was exposed to a WX particle-filled environment created in Area N for extended periods of time.]
146: 1574| [45] [Exposure to such an environment could artificially raise BC aptitude-- or at least that was the goal of the experiment.]
147: 1579| [45] [But Salyu showed no results.]
148: 1584| [45] [The experiments failed, leaving her with the Rank F Aptitude she was born with.]
149: 1642| [47] [Salyu]
150: 1643| [45] [(Compared to back then, any experiment would be better...)]
151: 1648| [45] [Salyu was thankful that those experiments had ended five years ago.]
152: 1653| [45] [The current "memory transfer experiment" hadn't had a single failure.]
153: 1658| [47] [Salyu]
154: 1659| [45] [(... Unlike the experiments in the past, these ones have a definite purpose.)]
155: 1719| [45] [Although she was a backup, Salyu was unable to leave and had gained all sorts of knowledge.]
156: 1724| [45] [She proved that even knowledge of how to perform physical techniques could be inherited.]
157: 1729| [45] [--By the age of 6, she had a complete understanding of Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" and was able to identify its points of issue from an existentialist perspective.]
158: 1734| [45] [By the age of 7, she solved the mystery of the zeta function that had been plaguing mathematicians across the globe. She also proved the Riemann Hypothesis.]
159: 1740| [45] [By the age of 8, she inherited the knowledge of an elderly pianist and successfully played the extremely difficult piano piece, "Gaspard de la nuit".]
160: 1745| [45] [By the age of 9, she had learned all sorts of athletic techniques ranging from artistic gymnastics to ball games and martial arts.]
161: 1750| [45] [By today, at the age of 10-- Salyu had the knowledge of 316 specialists of all sorts of fields packed within her brain.]
162: 1809| [47] [Salyu]
163: 1810| [45] [(... And thus, I became a monster.)]
164: 1815| [45] [The amount of knowledge in Salyu's brain had undeniably exceeded the apparent limit for human beings.]
165: 1820| [45] [Her swelling pool of knowledge was her entire life's history--]
166: 1825| [45] [--and before she knew it, it was the very proof of her existence.]
