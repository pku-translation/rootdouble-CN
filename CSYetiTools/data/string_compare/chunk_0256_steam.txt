  1:  205| [45] [--No matter how much he washed his face with cold water, Watase's headache would not subside.]
  2:  258| [47] [Watase]
  3:  261| [45] ["Ghh... urgh!"]
  4:  266| [45] [Watase even spewed out gastric juices, leaving Natsuhiko confused.]
  5:  275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  276| [45] [(Are these... effects of radiation...?)]
  7:  281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  282| [45] [(Or maybe... maybe Watase himself doesn't want to remember?)]
  9:  287| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  288| [45] [(Is he refusing to remember that he was full of malice, and this is a result of that rejection...?)]
 11:  293| [45] [Watase's own feelings of intense confusion were propagated to Natsuhiko.]
 12:  350| [85] [{Dammit... I'm thinking about way too much at once...!}]
 13:  351| [86] [Watase]
 14:  352| [86] [{Dammit... I'm thinking about way too much at once...!}]
 15:  367| [85] [{There might be monsters out there who can read people's minds...!}]
 16:  368| [86] [Watase]
 17:  369| [86] [{There might be monsters out there who can read people's minds...!}]
 18:  397| [45] [As soon as Watase had that thought, a bizarre spectacle flickered before his eyes.]
 19:  488| [86] [Yuuri]
 20:  489| [86] ["Who... who are you?"]
 21:  499| [85] ["Who... who are you?"]
 22:  562| [86] [Mashiro]
 23:  563| [86] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 24:  571| [85] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 25:  634| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  635| [86] ["How do you know our names...!?"]
 27:  643| [85] ["How do you know our names...!?"]
 28:  706| [86] [???]
 29:  707| [86] ["Because a whole lot of Communicators... people who can use BC, that is... have been coming to this city."]
 30:  715| [85] ["Because a whole lot of Communicators... people who can use BC, that is... have been coming to this city."]
 31:  811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  812| [45] [(!!? What was that...)]
 33:  817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  818| [45] [(Don't tell me Watase's memories are threatening to return!?)]
 35:  823| [45] [In shock, Natsuhiko strongly appealed to Watase.]
 36:  831| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  834| [45] [{That's enough, Watase Kasasagi... don't think too deeply about it...!}]
 38:  839| [45] [--But it had the opposite effect.]
 39:  847| [47] [Watase]
 40:  850| [45] ["!?"]
 41:  907| [85] [{Wait... could this auditory hallucination be trying to control me...!?}]
 42:  908| [86] [Watase]
 43:  909| [86] [{Wait... could this auditory hallucination be trying to control me...!?}]
 44:  924| [85] [{No, what if--}]
 45:  925| [86] [Watase]
 46:  926| [86] [{No, what if--}]
 47:  941| [85] [{What if someone's been controlling me this whole time...!?}]
 48:  942| [86] [Watase]
 49:  943| [86] [{What if someone's been controlling me this whole time...!?}]
 50:  958| [85] [{Then who is the "me" that I've thought was me up until now...!?}]
 51:  959| [86] [Watase]
 52:  960| [86] [{Then who is the "me" that I've thought was me up until now...!?}]
 53:  988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  989| [45] [(D... dammit, Watase! You're starting to jump at shadows!)]
 55:  994| [45] [Watase looked at his reflection in the mirror as if it weren't even his own face.]
 56: 1002| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1005| [45] ["D-dammit...!"]
 58: 1013| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1016| [45] ["What... or who should I believe in...!?"]
 60: 1021| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1022| [45] [(Oh crap! At this rate, he won't even be able to continue the search, will he!?)]
 62: 1027| [45] [Natsuhiko felt an impending sense of danger, but then--]
 63: 1092| [47] [???]
 64: 1095| [45] ["You're overthinking things, Watase."]
 65: 1103| [47] [???]
 66: 1106| [45] ["Do that and you'll just wuss out to the point where you won't be able to make sense of anything anymore."]
 67: 1111| [45] [--Inside the mirror was the face of a girl unfamiliar to both Natsuhiko and Watase.]
 68: 1164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1165| [45] [(!?)]
 70: 1170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1171| [45] [(What's going on!? Is this bastard hallucinating!?)]
 72: 1176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1177| [45] [(No, could this just be another flashback of a past memory!?)]
 74: 1221| [45] [Watase's mind suddenly reclaimed its composure.]
 75: 1229| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1232| [45] ["Don't overthink things, huh..."]
 77: 1243| [45] [With that calm whisper, Watase shut off the water.]
 78: 1255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1256| [45] [(Wh-what just happened!?)]
 80: 1261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1262| [45] [(Don't tell me...!)]
 82: 1267| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled was the words Watase had said when he was a murderer.]
 83: 1358| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1361| [45] ["You have precious friends, right? Well there was someone who was more precious to me than anyone else."]
 85: 1388| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1391| [45] ["Weak, but motivated. Stupid, but gentle. The very embodiment of light to me."]
 87: 1501| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1502| [45] [(... Then was that girl Watase's "embodiment of light"...?)]
 89: 1507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1508| [45] [(But if Watase suddenly saw her, then--)]
 91: 1513| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1514| [45] [(Does that mean my frequent manipulation of his memories has only made them more easy to recover!?)]
 93: 1519| [45] [Watase left the restroom. He didn't seem distracted in the slightest.]
 94: 1524| [45] [But Natsuhiko couldn't help but feel a little uneasy about him.]
 95: 1533| [45] [--And immediately after that--]
 96: 1538| [45] [Watase witnessed Ena speaking with Salyu.]
