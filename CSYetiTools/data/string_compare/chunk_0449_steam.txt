  0:   65| [45] [--It was a memory from a little while after Ena had been appointed to Rokumei Academy--]
  1:   70| [45] [She secretly met with Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa.]
  2:  134| [47] [Miyoko]
  3:  137| [45] ["--Nice to meet you. I'm Miyoko Tenkawa."]
  4:  142| [47] [Ena]
  5:  145| [45] ["Likewise. I'm Ena Tsubakiyama, ESP Bureau Communicator commissioner."]
  6:  150| [45] [The two women exchanged greetings on their first meeting.]
  7:  155| [45] [Ena had called the professor over to the school to discuss how to handle Natsuhiko.]
  8:  160| [45] [The BC room had no surveillance cameras. And since it was padded with BC insulators, nobody could read their minds with empathy without being seen.]
  9:  165| [45] [The walls were thick enough to drown out their voices as well, making it the perfect place to hold private conversations.]
 10:  170| [47] [Ena]
 11:  173| [45] ["I know you must be busy, so let's get to the main problem at hand."]
 12:  178| [47] [Ena]
 13:  181| [45] ["I have been tasked with managing the Communicators within Rokumei Academy this year."]
 14:  186| [47] [Ena]
 15:  189| [45] ["Naturally, my responsibilities include observing your son."]
 16:  197| [47] [Miyoko]
 17:  200| [45] ["Yes, please take care of him."]
 18:  205| [47] [Ena]
 19:  208| [45] ["Now, in regards to the system of observing your son, we'll be checking him against the ESP Bureau standards--"]
 20:  213| [47] [Ena]
 21:  216| [45] ["Once he demonstrates empathy, he will be considered for confinement in LABO. Is that all right?"]
 22:  221| [45] [That was a special measure that applied only to Rank S Aptitude Communicators.]
 23:  226| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa nodded indifferently as if she had already understood the situation.]
 24:  234| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  237| [45] ["I have no objections. By the time he would demonstrate Senses Sympathy, it would already be too late to act."]
 26:  242| [47] [Ena]
 27:  245| [45] ["Then in accordance with educational guidelines, I will guide him towards the demonstration of empathy."]
 28:  250| [47] [Ena]
 29:  253| [45] ["In the case he demonstrates empathy before graduation, he will be considered for confinement."]
 30:  258| [47] [Ena]
 31:  261| [45] ["In the case he does not demonstrate empathy before graduation, he will continue to be monitored by the ESP Bureau."]
 32:  269| [47] [Miyoko]
 33:  272| [45] ["Yes, please follow through with that plan."]
 34:  277| [45] [--Dr. Tenkawa kept answering Ena indifferently.]
 35:  282| [45] [Even though they were having an important discussion that would leave a great influence on her son's life.]
 36:  287| [47] [Ena]
 37:  288| [45] [(... Is this what it takes to be the parent of a Rank S Aptitude Communicator?)]
 38:  293| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa was a high ranking LABO researcher. She was clearly well aware of the potential dangers of Rank S Aptitude Communicators.]
 39:  298| [45] [She knew the reality that her son may one day suddenly become a monster.]
 40:  303| [45] [Ena could not even begin to imagine what sort of feelings a mother would have for that kind of son.]
 41:  308| [47] [Ena]
 42:  309| [45] [(Maybe I should try and get her to talk about that point a bit.)]
 43:  314| [45] [Ena tried to gently bring up that topic of discussion.]
 44:  339| [47] [Ena]
 45:  342| [45] ["... It must be tough for your own son to be an observation target."]
 46:  350| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  353| [45] ["No, I'm already used to it."]
 48:  358| [47] [Ena]
 49:  361| [45] ["But if your son demonstrates empathy-- he'll be confined in your own workplace, won't he?"]
 50:  366| [47] [Ena]
 51:  369| [45] ["So, well... are you fine with that?"]
 52:  377| [47] [Miyoko]
 53:  380| [45] ["It doesn't matter whether I'm fine with it or not. The matter has already been decided."]
 54:  385| [45] [She answered, once again, without changing her expression at all.]
 55:  390| [45] [Ena started to feel a freezing cold air drifting about the woman in front of her.]
 56:  395| [47] [Ena]
 57:  396| [45] [(As part of the ESP Bureau, it helps me greatly that she's so understanding... but something here just doesn't feel right to me.)]
 58:  401| [47] [Ena]
 59:  402| [45] [(Normally, no mother would easily consent to their own child's confinement, would they?)]
 60:  407| [45] [Once that thought hit Ena, Dr. Tenkawa sighed.]
 61:  433| [47] [Miyoko]
 62:  436| [45] ["... You think I'm a cold mother, don't you?"]
 63:  441| [47] [Ena]
 64:  444| [45] ["!! No, that's not what I--"]
 65:  452| [47] [Miyoko]
 66:  455| [45] ["There's no need to hide it. The previous manager had the same reaction."]
 67:  460| [47] [Ena]
 68:  461| [45] ["..."]
 69:  487| [47] [Miyoko]
 70:  490| [45] ["Well, it's understandable. Normally, mothers don't talk about the surveillance and confinement of their own children. That much is certain."]
 71:  516| [47] [Miyoko]
 72:  519| [45] ["But-- if you're from the ESP Bureau, you should be well aware of the details of the tragedy 16 years ago."]
 73:  524| [47] [Ena]
 74:  527| [45] ["R-right..."]
 75:  553| [47] [Miyoko]
 76:  556| [45] ["I do not wish for my son to turn out like Alice. Even the distress of confinement is a preferable alternative to N-ification."]
 77:  564| [47] [Miyoko]
 78:  567| [45] ["Is that not the obvious mentality for a mother to hold for her child?"]
 79:  572| [45] [Those words reminded Ena of something.]
 80:  577| [47] [Ena]
 81:  578| [45] [(Now that she mentions it, my father wrote about it in his journal too...)]
 82:  583| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa was once a researcher at the PRC.]
 83:  588| [45] [She had closely witnessed the entire process of how Alice was loved by those around her, but eventually succumbed to N-ification and caused the Great Rokumei City Arson.]
 84:  593| [45] [So perhaps in spite of her personal feelings for her own flesh and blood, Dr. Tenkawa came to the mentality that Rank S Aptitude Communicators should be strictly monitored.]
 85:  598| [45] [But even if Ena understood where she was coming from, that didn't mean she agreed with her. So she spoke up without thinking.]
 86:  603| [47] [Ena]
 87:  606| [45] ["--Professor, let me ask you one more thing."]
 88:  611| [47] [Ena]
 89:  614| [45] ["Do you wish for your son's happiness from the bottom of your heart?"]
 90:  640| [47] [Miyoko]
 91:  643| [45] ["Yes. That alone is for certain."]
 92:  648| [45] [She answered the question immediately.]
 93:  653| [45] [She then cast her eyes down and continued.]
 94:  679| [47] [Miyoko]
 95:  682| [45] ["... From my standpoint, I am unable to love my son in the same way that normal mothers can."]
 96:  690| [47] [Miyoko]
 97:  693| [45] ["I cannot convey to Natsuhiko even a shred of my love for him."]
 98:  701| [47] [Miyoko]
 99:  704| [45] ["As a result, we've grown apart and gradually stopped talking over the years... Honestly, it's tough, but I've resigned myself to this fate."]
100:  712| [47] [Miyoko]
101:  715| [45] ["I've hidden my professional duties, lied to the world, deceived even my own son, and continued to conduct BC research."]
102:  723| [47] [Miyoko]
103:  726| [45] ["If Natsuhiko were to find out, he'd be unable to forgive my many lies."]
104:  752| [47] [Miyoko]
105:  755| [45] ["But throughout my entire life hidden behind a facade, if only one thing were to be true--"]
106:  763| [47] [Miyoko]
107:  766| [45] ["It would be the desire for my son's happiness."]
108:  771| [47] [Ena]
109:  774| [45] ["!! ... How can you push yourself that far...?"]
110:  782| [47] [Miyoko]
111:  785| [45] ["I have no reason in particular. Only that I am that boy's mother."]
112:  811| [47] [Miyoko]
113:  814| [45] ["Before Natsuhiko was born, I believed that everything in this world could be explained by logic."]
114:  822| [47] [Miyoko]
115:  825| [45] ["I was a foolish little girl who saw even human emotion as nothing more than a target of analysis."]
116:  833| [47] [Miyoko]
117:  836| [45] ["But when I heard that child's first cry-- that shrewd way of thinking disappeared in an instant."]
118:  862| [47] [Miyoko]
119:  865| [45] ["Unconditional love is something that worldly logic can never explain, is it not?"]
120:  873| [47] [Miyoko]
121:  876| [45] ["That boy's presence alone filled my heart with joy."]
122:  884| [47] [Miyoko]
123:  887| [45] ["Ever since then, even my most trivial recollection of daily life has become an irreplaceable memory."]
124:  895| [47] [Miyoko]
125:  898| [45] ["The first time he called me 'Mom'. The first time we walked hand in hand to play in the park."]
126:  906| [47] [Miyoko]
127:  909| [45] ["The day I bought him his first bicycle. The first time he called my horrible cooking delicious..."]
128:  917| [47] [Miyoko]
129:  920| [45] ["I can vividly remember it all as if it happened yesterday."]
130:  946| [47] [Miyoko]
131:  949| [45] ["... And years later, when my husband passed away from illness... that boy offered me words of consolation."]
132:  957| [47] [Miyoko]
133:  960| [45] ["Even though he himself had to have been sad from the loss of his father."]
134:  986| [47] [Miyoko]
135:  989| [45] ["That's when I swore to myself that no matter what happened, I would protect Natsuhiko."]
136:  997| [47] [Miyoko]
137: 1000| [45] ["I would protect that boy even if it meant deceiving the world and staining my hands in sin after sin."]
138: 1005| [47] [Ena]
139: 1006| [45] ["..."]
140: 1032| [47] [Miyoko]
141: 1035| [45] ["... Commissioner Tsubakiyama. Do I have your understanding for the reason why I consent to his observation?"]
142: 1043| [47] [Miyoko]
143: 1046| [45] ["N-ification is the same as mental death. I don't want to make a monster out of my son."]
144: 1054| [47] [Miyoko]
145: 1057| [45] ["Even if it means locking him in a prison out of sight... as long as Natsuhiko remains himself, it's fine by me."]
146: 1082| [45] [After hearing the professor's long monologue, Ena quietly nodded.]
147: 1087| [47] [Ena]
148: 1090| [45] ["... I'm sorry for asking you such a rude question, Professor."]
149: 1116| [47] [Miyoko]
150: 1119| [45] ["It's okay. In fact, asking those sorts of questions makes you more trustworthy as a human being."]
151: 1124| [45] [And with that, Dr. Tenkawa smiled faintly.]
152: 1231| [45] [--Around two months later.]
153: 1236| [45] [Ena began to harbor the suspicion that LABO was secretly conducting human experimentation.]
154: 1241| [45] [She then thought of asking Dr. Tenkawa about it up front...]
155: 1246| [45] [But oddly enough, it was then that she had remembered Dr. Tenkawa's words.]
156: 1251| [45] ["I would protect that boy even if it meant deceiving the world and staining my hands in sin after sin."]
157: 1256| [45] [--If that meant she was willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of her son, then--]
158: 1261| [45] [Ena couldn't bring herself to ask Dr. Tenkawa about it.]
159: 1266| [45] [Not after Ena knew about her boundless love...]
