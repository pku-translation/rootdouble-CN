  0:   61| [45] [--Several hours later, Yuuri was waiting patiently in the hospital room.]
  1:  110| [45] [But Dr. Tenkawa still hadn't come back, leaving Yuuri in the dark as to Natsuhiko's condition.]
  2:  115| [45] [As she waited in the silence--]
  3:  120| [45] [She eventually heard a commotion outside the hospital room.]
  4:  194| [45] [--It was the sound of many footsteps.]
  5:  199| [45] [People were swiftly approaching her hospital room.]
  6:  204| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  205| [45] [(Huh... wh-what?)]
  8:  210| [45] [The footsteps were rough and violent, which scared Yuuri a little.]
  9:  217| [47] [???]
 10:  220| [45] ["The patient in this room?"]
 11:  225| [47] [???]
 12:  228| [45] ["Yeah."]
 13:  233| [47] [???]
 14:  236| [45] ["The hospital director's come to an agreement. There are no other patients in this ward.%NPlease proceed freely."]
 15:  241| [45] [Whispers could be heard from in front of the room.]
 16:  256| [45] [Just then, a pitter patter of rushing footsteps added to the cacophony. Suddenly, a new voice yelled out.]
 17:  264| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  267| [45] ["Hey, what do you people think you're doing!?"]
 19:  272| [45] [It was Dr. Tenkawa's voice.]
 20:  279| [45] [Yuuri felt a little relieved, but she was still scared. She didn't want to go check out the situation outside for herself.]
 21:  287| [47] [Miyoko]
 22:  290| [45] ["Mr. Eriguchi, what is the meaning of this? What pushed you to mobilize Security Sector 6?"]
 23:  295| [47] [Eriguchi]
 24:  298| [45] ["Orders from above."]
 25:  303| [47] [Eriguchi]
 26:  306| [45] ["Effective today henceforth, Yuuri Kotono has been registered as LABO's fourth test subject."]
 27:  314| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  317| [45] ["What...!?"]
 29:  325| [47] [Miyoko]
 30:  328| [45] ["This must be some sort of joke! She's a friend of my son!"]
 31:  333| [47] [Eriguchi]
 32:  336| [45] ["That's a statement unbefitting of Senior Fellow Miyoko Tenkawa, the very brains of LABO."]
 33:  341| [47] [Eriguchi]
 34:  344| [45] ["The girl is a Rank S Communicator, an extreme rarity across the globe..."]
 35:  349| [47] [Eriguchi]
 36:  352| [45] ["And you're well aware of just how dangerous such a being is, I assume?"]
 37:  360| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  363| [45] ["You plan to make my own son into a test subject too, don't you!?"]
 39:  368| [47] [Eriguchi]
 40:  371| [45] ["But of course."]
 41:  376| [47] [Eriguchi]
 42:  379| [45] ["We cannot allow our emotions as individuals to take precedence over reason and simply leave these beings to their own devices."]
 43:  387| [47] [Miyoko]
 44:  390| [45] ["Don't give me that garbage!"]
 45:  398| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  401| [45] ["Ignoring what just happened the other day, LABO's ethics are clearly lacking as of late!"]
 47:  409| [47] [Miyoko]
 48:  412| [45] ["If this continues, I'll have to file a report to the ESP Bureau, you know!?"]
 49:  417| [47] [Eriguchi]
 50:  420| [45] ["You are aware that you can't do that, correct? Not if you consider your son's safety..."]
 51:  428| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  431| [45] ["..."]
 53:  436| [45] [A heavy silence fell upon them.]
 54:  441| [45] [Eventually, Dr. Tenkawa muttered in a stifled voice.]
 55:  449| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  452| [45] ["... Yuuri's still in no condition to move due to the aftereffects of the fire."]
 57:  460| [47] [Miyoko]
 58:  463| [45] ["I feel that transporting her to LABO will be too great of a burden on her body..."]
 59:  471| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  474| [45] ["Mr. Eriguchi. Go home today and take your Security Sector 6 people with you."]
 61:  479| [47] [Eriguchi]
 62:  482| [45] ["... Well, fine. We'll let you save face for today, Dr. Tenkawa."]
 63:  487| [47] [Eriguchi]
 64:  490| [45] ["I'll be back."]
 65:  507| [45] [And with those words, the sound of several footsteps faded into the distance.]
 66:  512| [45] [Once Yuuri could no longer hear them,]
 67:  569| [45] [the hospital door opened and Dr. Tenkawa came in.]
 68:  577| [47] [Yuuri]
 69:  580| [45] ["Ah... Professor..."]
 70:  606| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  609| [45] ["Yuuri..."]
 72:  614| [45] [The professor smiled weakly as she walked on over to Yuuri.]
 73:  640| [47] [Miyoko]
 74:  643| [45] ["... Did you hear that conversation just now?"]
 75:  651| [47] [Yuuri]
 76:  654| [45] ["Y-yeah... but there were so many things I didn't understand..."]
 77:  662| [47] [Yuuri]
 78:  665| [45] ["... Have things gotten difficult?"]
 79:  691| [47] [Miyoko]
 80:  694| [45] ["Perhaps..."]
 81:  699| [45] [The professor sighed deeply.]
 82:  707| [47] [Yuuri]
 83:  710| [45] ["Um... please tell me."]
 84:  718| [47] [Yuuri]
 85:  721| [45] ["What happened to us?"]
 86:  726| [45] [The professor remained silent for a while before speaking with a resigned tone of voice.]
 87:  752| [47] [Miyoko]
 88:  755| [45] ["... Yuuri. As a result of the accident, your genetic code mutated, as did Natsuhiko's."]
 89:  763| [47] [Yuuri]
 90:  766| [45] ["Genetic code?"]
 91:  792| [47] [Miyoko]
 92:  795| [45] ["It's what dictates the composition of your body-- like a blueprint, so to speak."]
 93:  803| [47] [Miyoko]
 94:  806| [45] ["One of the genes in your genetic code, the IGF2R gene-- a gene that relates to BC usage--%Nwas damaged and reconstructed due to the particles that were spreading inside the facility."]
 95:  814| [47] [Miyoko]
 96:  817| [45] ["Your BC 'aptitude' rose from Rank C to Rank S."]
 97:  843| [47] [Miyoko]
 98:  846| [45] ["Despite how aptitude normally remains constant throughout one's lifetime."]
 99:  854| [47] [Yuuri]
100:  857| [45] ["...?"]
101:  862| [45] [Yuuri stared blankly. She didn't quite understand what the professor was saying.]
102:  867| [45] [The professor then continued.]
103:  893| [47] [Miyoko]
104:  896| [45] ["Remember how we did tests to see if you could use BC this afternoon?"]
105:  904| [47] [Yuuri]
106:  907| [45] ["Y-yes."]
107:  933| [47] [Miyoko]
108:  936| [45] ["You were able to use telepathy and empathy without any practice... Those results said it all."]
109:  944| [47] [Miyoko]
110:  947| [45] ["You became a world-class Communicator."]
111:  955| [47] [Yuuri]
112:  958| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
113:  984| [47] [Miyoko]
114:  987| [45] ["It's unprecedented."]
115:  995| [47] [Miyoko]
116:  998| [45] ["And yet it wasn't just you. Natsuhiko likewise mutated into Rank S Aptitude."]
117: 1006| [47] [Miyoko]
118: 1009| [45] ["His ability rose accordingly as well."]
119: 1035| [47] [Miyoko]
120: 1038| [45] ["Currently, only I can attest to his ability... but during the fire, Natsuhiko used telepathy, you see?"]
121: 1046| [47] [Yuuri]
122: 1049| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
123: 1075| [47] [Miyoko]
124: 1078| [45] ["But because of those results... LABO now has their eyes on you."]
125: 1104| [47] [Miyoko]
126: 1107| [45] ["They're going to incarcerate both you and Natsuhiko inside of LABO..."]
127: 1115| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1118| [45] ["In-car-sir-ate?"]
129: 1144| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1147| [45] ["They're going to lock you up and make you into a test subject for BC research."]
131: 1155| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1158| [45] ["LABO isn't actually a nuclear power research facility, but a BC research facility."]
133: 1166| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1169| [45] ["Likewise, I don't conduct nuclear power research, but BC research. I'm a central personage of the organization..."]
135: 1195| [47] [Miyoko]
136: 1198| [45] ["And yet... I never expected that my own son and his friend would have to be incarcerated...!"]
137: 1206| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 1209| [45] ["...!"]
139: 1214| [45] [It wasn't as if Yuuri understood everything the professor was saying,]
140: 1219| [45] [but she did understand some of it.]
141: 1288| [45] [When she and Natsuhiko were cornered by the fire in LABO, she felt as if she had heard Natsuhiko's telepathy-- but it turns out she hadn't been hearing things after all.]
142: 1304| [45] [The two of them had been reborn as elite Communicators.]
143: 1309| [45] [And as a result, they would have to live the rest of their lives locked away.]
144: 1317| [47] [Yuuri]
145: 1320| [45] ["Can't you get them to stop it...?"]
146: 1346| [47] [Miyoko]
147: 1349| [45] ["... I'm sorry."]
148: 1357| [47] [Miyoko]
149: 1360| [45] ["I know it must be hard to understand why, but there are reasons why I can't."]
150: 1368| [47] [Miyoko]
151: 1371| [45] ["Because it is indeed true that the abilities you two have gained are dangerous...!"]
152: 1376| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa answered painfully.]
153: 1381| [45] [But if there were no other way, then--]
154: 1389| [47] [Yuuri]
155: 1392| [45] ["Um... Professor?"]
156: 1418| [47] [Miyoko]
157: 1421| [45] ["Huh?"]
158: 1429| [47] [Yuuri]
159: 1432| [45] ["Do they need to lock both of us up?"]
160: 1458| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 1461| [45] ["... What do you mean?"]
162: 1468| [45] [Yuuri stated her own thoughts as the professor looked on, confused.]
163: 1476| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 1479| [45] ["If I go to LABO willingly..."]
165: 1487| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 1490| [45] ["Can they let Hikorin stay free in return...?"]
167: 1557| [47] [Miyoko]
168: 1560| [45] ["!!"]
169: 1568| [47] [Miyoko]
170: 1571| [45] ["... That might be possible."]
171: 1597| [47] [Miyoko]
172: 1600| [45] ["Fortunately, Natsuhiko hasn't awakened yet. As long as he's still unaware of the circumstances, then maybe..."]
173: 1626| [47] [Miyoko]
174: 1629| [45] ["But are you sure, Yuuri?"]
175: 1637| [47] [Yuuri]
176: 1640| [45] ["I'm sure."]
177: 1648| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 1651| [45] ["Because Hikorin saved me."]
179: 1659| [47] [Yuuri]
180: 1662| [45] ["So now it's my turn."]
181: 1667| [45] [That was the moment Yuuri decided her own fate.]
182: 1720| [45] [--Two days later, when Yuuri was transferred to LABO, Dr. Tenkawa informed her of the news.]
183: 1795| [47] [Miyoko]
184: 1798| [45] ["... I've told Natsuhiko that you died in the fire."]
185: 1806| [47] [Yuuri]
186: 1809| [45] ["I see..."]
187: 1835| [47] [Miyoko]
188: 1838| [45] ["From now on, Natsuhiko will be placed under surveillance by both LABO and government agencies as a special observation target."]
189: 1846| [47] [Miyoko]
190: 1849| [45] ["You shall be incarcerated in LABO and Natsuhiko shall live within society--"]
191: 1857| [47] [Miyoko]
192: 1860| [45] ["By comparing how you two Communicators develop, we can gain valuable data. I somehow managed to convince the higher ups using that pretext."]
193: 1886| [47] [Miyoko]
194: 1889| [45] ["But one condition they have is that once Natsuhiko surpasses a certain ability level, he will immediately be transferred here..."]
195: 1894| [45] [That would be a desirable result for Yuuri, but--]
196: 1899| [47] [Yuuri]
197: 1900| [45] [(But... Hikorin loves it outside.)]
198: 1905| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 1906| [45] [(Because he's got lots of friends... So it'd be so sad if he got locked up inside.)]
200: 1911| [45] [The professor spoke to Yuuri as she had that thought.]
201: 1937| [47] [Miyoko]
202: 1940| [45] ["... Yuuri, if you want, maybe we really should keep Natsuhiko with you..."]
203: 1948| [47] [Yuuri]
204: 1951| [45] ["No, it's okay."]
205: 1956| [45] [Yuuri smiled at the professor.]
206: 1964| [47] [Yuuri]
207: 1967| [45] ["... But instead, can I ask for just one thing...?"]
208: 1993| [47] [Miyoko]
209: 1996| [45] ["... What is it?"]
210: 2004| [47] [Yuuri]
211: 2007| [45] ["Please let me see him... Even just once in a while... Even just once a year. Please."]
212: 2015| [47] [Yuuri]
213: 2018| [45] ["That's all I ask."]
214: 2041| [47] [Miyoko]
215: 2042| [45] ["..."]
216: 2068| [47] [Miyoko]
217: 2071| [45] ["... I promise."]
218: 2076| [45] [The professor's words softly shook the surrounding air.]
219: 2106| [45] [--That memory left Natsuhiko at a loss for words.]
220: 2111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 2112| [45] [(H-hey... What the hell's this...!?)]
222: 2117| [45] [It was a truth far beyond his expectations.]
223: 2122| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2123| [45] [(LABO tried to incarcerate us as test subjects!?)]
225: 2128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2129| [45] [(Not just Yuuri, but me too!?)]
227: 2134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 2135| [45] [(And Yuuri sacrificed her freedom for my sake...!?)]
229: 2140| [45] [Even though his own senses were supposed to have faded away, he could have sworn he felt his heart pounding like an alarm bell.]
230: 2145| [47] [Natsuhiko]
231: 2146| [45] [(Th-then...)]
232: 2151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 2152| [45] [(What happened to Yuuri afterwards!?)]
234: 2157| [45] [As that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, more and more visions floated before his eyes.]
