  0:   46| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 1]
  1:   54| [45] [But Jun's angry shouts filled their ears the moment they reached the connecting passage to the outer ring.]
  2:   62| [47] [Jun]
  3:   65| [45] ["You're not qualified to handle this, so just do what I tell you!"]
  4:   73| [47] [Ena]
  5:   76| [45] ["Oh come on, it's just smoke! I didn't take rescue workers for cowards!"]
  6:  170| [45] [Jun and Ena were engaged in a fierce argument.]
  7:  175| [45] [Ukita watched the two of them with a bewildered look on his face.]
  8:  183| [47] [Watase]
  9:  186| [45] ["Wh-what happened!?"]
 10:  289| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  292| [45] ["Moribe, what's all this commotion about!?"]
 12:  318| [47] [Jun]
 13:  321| [45] ["Ah, Lieutenant!"]
 14:  393| [47] [Jun]
 15:  396| [45] ["There's smoke in the outer ring up ahead. Looks like there's traces of a fire there."]
 16:  404| [47] [Jun]
 17:  407| [45] ["But we don't know where the fire's coming from since there's a ton of rooms, so I was telling Ms. Tsubakiyama and Mr. Ukita to wait somewhere safe, but--"]
 18:  435| [47] [Ena]
 19:  438| [45] ["Don't be an idiot! If there's traces of a fire, then that's all the more reason why we should -all- be searching!"]
 20:  464| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  467| [45] ["... So as you can see, neither of them is willing to compromise."]
 22:  472| [45] [Watase thought for a second about who he should side with, and then--]
 23:  490| [47] [Watase]
 24:  493| [45] ["Calm down, Teach! Think about it: it's too dangerous for an untrained civilian to go somewhere where there could be a fire raging, right!?"]
 25:  519| [47] [Ena]
 26:  522| [45] ["What was that!?"]
 27:  548| [47] [Jun]
 28:  551| [45] ["See? Our captain has amnesia and thus is no better than an amateur at the moment, and even -he's- agreeing with me! Just think with common sense already."]
 29:  577| [47] [Jun]
 30:  580| [45] ["We just simply can't let a civilian go with us to an area that could be on fire!"]
 31:  606| [47] [Ena]
 32:  609| [45] ["The hell are you two on about!? It's just a little smo--"]
 33:  614| [45] [But before Ena could say any more, Kazami sharply cut in.]
 34:  640| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  643| [45] ["Do you want to die, Ms. Tsubakiyama?"]
 36:  656| [47] [Watase]
 37:  659| [45] ["Hold on, Moribe! Teach is right! We should all search together quickly!"]
 38:  685| [47] [Jun]
 39:  688| [45] ["What? An amnesiac like you is trying to give me advice?"]
 40:  696| [47] [Watase]
 41:  699| [45] ["But we're pressed for time, aren't we? So isn't what Teach's saying more logical?"]
 42:  725| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  728| [45] ["No, Moribe's judgment is right in this case, Captain. We cannot let a civilian go to an area that's potentially on fire."]
 44:  754| [47] [Ena]
 45:  757| [45] ["You're siding with her too, Lieutenant? It's just a little smo--"]
 46:  783| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  786| [45] ["Do you want to die, Ms. Tsubakiyama?"]
 48:  794| [47] [Watase]
 49:  795| [45] [(No, they both have good points...)]
 50:  800| [45] [As Watase pondered this, Kazami called out to Ena in a stern tone.]
 51:  826| [47] [Kazami]
 52:  829| [45] ["Moribe's judgment is right in this case, Ms. Tsubakiyama. We cannot let a civilian go to an area that's potentially on fire."]
 53:  855| [47] [Ena]
 54:  858| [45] ["You're siding with her too, Lieutenant? It's just a little smo--"]
 55:  884| [47] [Kazami]
 56:  887| [45] ["Do you want to die?"]
 57:  913| [47] [Ena]
 58:  916| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 59:  942| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  945| [45] ["If you don't want to die, then please stop complaining and listen to us."]
 61:  971| [47] [Ena]
 62:  974| [45] ["..."]
 63:  979| [45] [Ena instinctively gasped at Kazami's harsh words.]
 64: 1005| [47] [Ena]
 65: 1008| [45] ["... I-I just wanted to help..."]
 66: 1034| [47] [Kazami]
 67: 1037| [45] ["And I truly am grateful for that. I apologize for being harsh on you."]
 68: 1045| [47] [Kazami]
 69: 1048| [45] ["But you can't take even the smallest of fires lightly. Please trust our judgment when it comes to disaster sites."]
 70: 1056| [47] [Kazami]
 71: 1059| [45] ["Our mission is to ensure that everyone gets out of here in one piece. So please--"]
 72: 1064| [45] [Kazami bowed her head with those words.]
 73: 1069| [45] [Ena looked away from her uncomfortably.]
 74: 1095| [47] [Ena]
 75: 1098| [45] ["All right... then I'll leave it up to the professionals."]
 76: 1124| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1127| [45] ["Thank you very much."]
 78: 1210| [45] [Watase straightened his back with a crunch at those words.]
 79: 1218| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1221| [45] ["So that means... it's our turn to shine, isn't it?"]
 81: 1247| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1250| [45] ["That's right, it's round one in your fight to get back into fighting shape. Perfect chance to see if you can reclaim your instincts."]
 83: 1277| [47] [Kazami]
 84: 1280| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, please wait with Yuuri in the inner ring for us."]
 85: 1306| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1309| [45] ["We did not see any signs of a fire there, but please be cautious and remain aware of your surroundings, just as a precaution."]
 87: 1418| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1421| [45] ["Very well, leave it to us."]
 89: 1426| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1427| [45] ["..."]
 91: 1435| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1438| [45] ["Roger that. See you later."]
 93: 1443| [45] [After the rest of the group had finished wishing them luck, the rescue workers headed for the outer ring.]
 94: 1558| [45] [--Area 3, outer ring, B2--]
 95: 1564| [45] [This block had multiple doors lining the hallway on both sides.]
 96: 1572| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1575| [45] ["You were right, it is a bit smoky--"]
 98: 1580| [45] [He didn't see any traces of a fire at first glance, but the entire hallway was filled with thin smoke.]
 99: 1588| [47] [Watase]
100: 1591| [45] ["Hold on a second, is this facility's air conditioning not working?"]
101: 1653| [47] [Jun]
102: 1656| [45] ["It is for the most part, but there's some places where it's broken. Like here."]
103: 1683| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1686| [45] ["Most likely due to the effects of the fire."]
105: 1691| [45] [Kazami looked around the block after saying this, then continued.]
106: 1717| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1720| [45] ["At any rate, there's something you need to be cautious of while searching this block, Captain."]
108: 1728| [47] [Watase]
109: 1731| [45] ["What's that?"]
110: 1739| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1742| [45] ["Please check each of the doors with your IRT scanner to make sure they're not hot before we go opening them."]
112: 1768| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1771| [45] ["If a door ever shows up on the scanner as red or yellow, then make sure you do -not- open it for any reason."]
114: 1779| [47] [Watase]
115: 1782| [45] ["Huh? Why's that?"]
116: 1808| [47] [Jun]
117: 1811| [45] ["It'll cause a 'backdraft' if you do."]
118: 1819| [47] [Jun]
119: 1822| [45] ["When a fire burns in a sealed-off room, it eventually consumes all the oxygen in that room and starts to smolder."]
120: 1830| [47] [Jun]
121: 1833| [45] ["So when the door to the place is opened, fresh air rapidly pours into the room and then--"]
122: 1873| [47] [Jun]
123: 1876| [45] ["Kaboom!!"]
124: 1948| [47] [Jun]
125: 1951| [45] ["... it starts burning again like an explosion."]
126: 1959| [47] [Jun]
127: 1962| [45] ["We can't see any fire in this block, but we can see smoke. Which means it's possible that there's a fire smoldering in one of these rooms."]
128: 1988| [47] [Kazami]
129: 1991| [45] ["So if you don't carefully check the temperature... all us of could get blown away."]
130: 2017| [47] [Jun]
131: 2020| [45] ["It's a real big responsibility. You sure you're up for it?"]
132: 2039| [47] [Watase]
133: 2042| [45] ["..."]
134: 2047| [45] [Watase gulped and checked his surroundings.]
135: 2052| [45] [About ten doors lined the hallway.]
136: 2057| [45] [They all felt like traps to him. Explosive booby traps just waiting to be tripped.]
137: 2065| [47] [Watase]
138: 2068| [45] ["... So I need to take this seriously or we'll all be screwed."]
139: 2076| [47] [Watase]
140: 2079| [45] ["Every single one of these doors has the potential risk of shooting flames out if I open it, right?"]
141: 2105| [47] [Kazami]
142: 2108| [45] ["Yes. But there might also be AD or survivors behind them."]
143: 2165| [47] [Watase]
144: 2168| [45] ["... Ah, I see."]
145: 2194| [47] [Jun]
146: 2197| [45] ["'I see'... Captain, you sure you get it?"]
147: 2223| [47] [Kazami]
148: 2226| [45] ["Firefighting is all about teamwork. Not only must our minds be as one, but we need to work closely together as one unit, understand?"]
149: 2243| [47] [Watase]
150: 2246| [45] ["Ah... s-sorry about that. Leave it to me."]
151: 2251| [45] [Determined not to let them down, Watase re-geared his mind back to the task on hand.]
152: 2256| [45] [He checked his surroundings to find ten doors lining the hall.]
153: 2261| [45] [They all felt like traps to him. Explosive booby traps just waiting to be tripped.]
154: 2269| [47] [Watase]
155: 2272| [45] ["But... I have to take this seriously or we'll be screwed, won't we?"]
156: 2280| [47] [Watase]
157: 2283| [45] ["Every single one of these doors has the potential risk of shooting flames out if I open it, right?"]
158: 2309| [47] [Kazami]
159: 2312| [45] ["Naturally. But there might also be AD or survivors behind them."]
160: 2344| [47] [Jun]
161: 2347| [45] ["And we can't just leave the source of the fire alone. So in the end, you'll have to man up and open every last one of them."]
162: 2373| [47] [Kazami]
163: 2376| [45] ["Don't rush things, but keep in mind that we have limited time to search."]
164: 2384| [47] [Watase]
165: 2387| [45] ["Y-yeah, got it...!"]
166: 2431| [45] [--And with that, the group began searching each and every room.]
167: 2477| [45] [They stood in front of a door at the end of the outer ring-- with Kazami pointing a fire hose right at it.]
168: 2521| [45] [Watase turned on the PDA's IRT function and checked the door for heat just as he'd been told.]
169: 2529| [47] [Watase]
170: 2532| [45] ["The door's... blue. No heat here."]
171: 2559| [47] [Jun]
172: 2562| [45] ["Roger! Opening the door!"]
173: 2567| [45] [Jun announced that as she opened the door.]
174: 2643| [47] [Watase]
175: 2646| [45] ["...!"]
176: 2651| [45] [Watase braced himself the moment the door opened--]
177: 2709| [45] [But all that waited for them was a trim and tidy office.]
178: 2717| [47] [Watase]
179: 2720| [45] ["... Phew, no signs of a fire here, huh?"]
180: 2782| [47] [Jun]
181: 2785| [45] ["Yeah, but the same goes for any survivors."]
182: 2812| [47] [Kazami]
183: 2815| [45] ["Then search the place for AD. You have 30 seconds!"]
184: 2837| [45] [The group quickly searched the room in accordance with those orders.]
185: 2847| [45] [It wasn't long before they found a box.]
186: 2894| [47] [Watase]
187: 2897| [45] ["Huh!? This is a medical box, isn't it!?"]
188: 2902| [45] [Watase ran up to it and looked inside.]
189: 2911| [45] [But-- it was empty.]
190: 2916| [45] [It appeared that someone had already taken its contents.]
191: 2924| [47] [Watase]
192: 2927| [45] ["Tch, no luck, huh..."]
193: 2955| [47] [Jun]
194: 2958| [45] ["And no card either."]
195: 2985| [47] [Kazami]
196: 2988| [45] ["Then let's move on to the next room. Be more efficient this time."]
197: 3036| [45] [The room opposite of that one was a stairwell.]
198: 3041| [45] [Unlike the automatic sliding doors that the other rooms used, this one had a fire door with heavy hinges.]
199: 3052| [45] [But when they opened it--]
200: 3100| [45] [all they saw was a collapsed staircase.]
201: 3108| [47] [Watase]
202: 3111| [45] ["Hold on, why did this staircase collapse? I don't see any traces of a fire in here..."]
203: 3144| [47] [Kazami]
204: 3147| [45] ["Indeed, it doesn't look like it was caused by a fire. I believe that it was one of those 'explosions of unknown origin' that did this."]
205: 3188| [47] [Jun]
206: 3191| [45] ["C'mon, let's just forget it and move on to the next room already. Chop chop."]
207: 3196| [45] [The group continued the search at Jun's urging.]
208: 3288| [45] [--However,]
209: 3380| [45] [no matter how many rooms they checked after that,]
210: 3472| [45] [the only things they found were empty medical boxes.]
211: 3477| [45] [To make matters worse, there was no sign of any of the survivors, to say the least of the source of the fire.]
212: 3522| [45] [--They even checked the bathrooms, but that turned out to be a fruitless endeavor.]
213: 3527| [47] [Watase]
214: 3528| [45] [(Goddammit, we need to find some AD...!)]
215: 3533| [45] [Watase was starting to get more and more impatient.]
216: 3538| [45] [The last time the group had taken any AD was around 9:20 AM.]
217: 3543| [45] [But his watch showed that it was almost 10:00 AM now.]
218: 3548| [47] [Watase]
219: 3549| [45] [(We don't even have half an hour...)]
220: 3554| [45] [The survivors and security cards were important too, of course, but they wouldn't be able to live past the next hour without some AD.]
221: 3559| [47] [Watase]
222: 3560| [45] [(Shit, this is all me and my amnesia's fault...)]
223: 3565| [47] [Watase]
224: 3566| [45] [(I kept wasting everyone's time by demanding all those explanations from them...!)]
225: 3571| [45] [They needed to get their hands on some AD quickly in order to make up for that mistake.]
226: 3576| [45] [The group approached the final door in the outer ring as Watase thought this.]
227: 3620| [45] [And like usual, he used the IRT scanner to check the door.]
228: 3628| [47] [Watase]
229: 3631| [45] ["There's... no heat."]
230: 3693| [47] [Kazami]
231: 3696| [45] ["That's strange. Perhaps the smoke came in here from another area, then?"]
232: 3723| [47] [Jun]
233: 3726| [45] ["Anyway, roger that. I'm opening the door now."]
234: 3775| [45] [Jun then moved to press the button for the door.]
235: 3780| [45] [They'd been through this routine ten times already-- and as a result, Watase was probably nowhere near as focused as he'd been at first because he'd "gotten used to it".]
236: 3785| [45] [That's why he didn't notice it sooner.]
237: 3830| [47] [Watase]
238: 3831| [45] [(... Hmm!?)]
239: 3836| [45] [That unlike all the other doors, the IRT scanner was showing that this otherwise blue one had a slight yellow tinge to it.]
240: 3844| [47] [Watase]
241: 3847| [45] ["...! Oh crap! Moribe, don't open it!"]
242: 3852| [45] [But it was too late.]
243: 3910| [45] [Jun had already hit the button-- causing the door to slide open.]
244: 4014| [45] [At that moment, the group all felt something like the air being sucked inward.]
245: 4040| [47] [Jun]
246: 4043| [45] ["!?"]
247: 4063| [45] [Jun immediately jumped away from the door.]
248: 4068| [45] [Fire spewed forth from the room only a mere second later.]
249: 4202| [47] [Watase]
250: 4203| [45] [(Ah!)]
251: 4208| [45] [Watase tried to dodge it, but his body wouldn't move.]
252: 4216| [47] [Kazami]
253: 4219| [45] ["Captain!!"]
254: 4224| [45] [No sooner had Watase heard that shout]
255: 4285| [45] [than were he and the rest of the group blown away by the blast.]
256: 4290| [47] [Watase]
257: 4291| [45] [(Am I dead!?)]
258: 4296| [45] [He wondered that for a second-- but no. He was still alive.]
259: 4301| [45] [However, it also felt like something was crushing his body.]
260: 4309| [47] [Watase]
261: 4312| [45] ["Ugh..."]
262: 4317| [45] [Watase then opened his eyes,]
263: 4430| [47] [Kazami]
264: 4433| [45] ["Captain, are you all right!?"]
265: 4486| [45] [only to see Kazami shouting at him and helping him up.]
266: 4491| [45] [It seemed she'd knocked him out of the way just in the nick of time.]
267: 4499| [47] [Watase]
268: 4502| [45] ["I-I'm okay! But this is--"]
269: 4570| [45] [His surroundings had transformed into a sea of flames in the blink of an eye.]
270: 4575| [45] [The fire that'd spewed from the room was spreading all the way out into the hall.]
271: 4596| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 1]
272: 4639| [45] [The fire hose had fallen out of Kazami's grasp and was now lying past the roaring flames.]
273: 4672| [47] [Jun]
274: 4675| [45] ["--You guys okay!?"]
275: 4680| [45] [Watase looked in the direction of that shout find Jun standing on the other side of the fire.]
276: 4713| [47] [Kazami]
277: 4716| [45] ["Affirmative! Pass the fire hose over here first!"]
278: 4724| [47] [Jun]
279: 4727| [45] ["On it!"]
280: 4741| [45] [Jun picked up the hose lying in the fire and tossed it with an underhand throw.]
281: 4752| [45] [The metal nozzle slid across the floor and stopped right in front of Kazami.]
282: 4858| [45] [But the flames swayed at that moment, briefly licking at Watase's left hand.]
283: 5018| [47] [Watase]
284: 5021| [45] ["Ouch!"]
285: 5026| [45] [The heat shot through his gloves and burned the back of his hand.]
286: 5031| [45] [Hot wind then blew in his face as if to add insult to injury, causing Watase to breathe it in and singe his nostril hairs.]
287: 5039| [47] [Watase]
288: 5042| [45] ["*cough*! *cough*!"]
289: 5068| [47] [Kazami]
290: 5071| [45] ["What are you doing, Captain! Please fall back!"]
291: 5086| [47] [Watase]
292: 5089| [45] ["G-got it--"]
293: 5143| [45] [But Watase couldn't comply with that order.]
294: 5148| [45] [He was the one who'd brought this disaster down on them.]
295: 5153| [47] [Watase]
296: 5154| [45] [(D-Dammit! I've got to do something!)]
297: 5159| [45] [Watase looked for a fire hydrant as he thought this-- but to no luck.]
298: 5185| [47] [Kazami]
299: 5188| [45] ["Did you not hear me!? Fall back!"]
300: 5203| [47] [Watase]
301: 5206| [45] ["No, leave this to me!"]
302: 5246| [45] [Watase then stole the hose right out of Kazami's hands.]
303: 5251| [45] [He felt he had to make up for his mistake immediately.]
304: 5259| [47] [Kazami]
305: 5262| [45] ["Stop! I can't let you handle this in your condition--!"]
306: 5267| [45] [But Watase shook off her attempts to stop him and opened the nozzle, imitating the way he'd seen Kazami do it earlier.]
307: 5311| [47] [Watase]
308: 5314| [45] ["--!!"]
309: 5319| [45] [Watase was caught off guard for a moment. The water pressure was far greater than he'd expected.]
310: 5324| [45] [So he used all his might to keep the hose under control, knowing it'd most likely shoot right out of his hands if he let his guard down for even a second.]
311: 5329| [47] [Watase]
312: 5330| [45] [(It's okay! When it comes down to it, I'm still a rescue worker!)]
313: 5335| [45] [Watase managed to convince himself of this--]
314: 5343| [47] [Watase]
315: 5346| [45] ["Uwooooooooooooh!"]
316: 5351| [45] [--and went charging into the room that was still spewing flames.]
317: 5416| [47] [Watase]
318: 5419| [45] ["R... right!"]
319: 5454| [45] [As he said this, Watase noticed that there was something caught on his right hand.]
320: 5499| [47] [Watase]
321: 5500| [45] [(?)]
322: 5505| [45] [It was a locket with a broken chain.]
323: 5510| [45] [Kazami had apparently dropped it when she'd tackled him earlier.]
324: 5515| [45] [Watase quickly put it in his pocket and looked at the sight that lay in front of him.]
325: 5566| [45] [Kazami was staring at the fire, twisting the hose's nozzle.]
326: 5574| [47] [Kazami]
327: 5577| [45] ["Commencing hose down!"]
328: 5629| [45] [A fierce spray of water shot from the hose at the same time.]
329: 5634| [45] [It mowed down the flames, pushing them back all at once.]
330: 5642| [47] [Watase]
331: 5645| [45] ["Amazing...!"]
332: 5707| [47] [Kazami]
333: 5710| [45] ["'Read the path of the flames, then suppress them with water. Take out the source of the fire after that'."]
334: 5736| [47] [Kazami]
335: 5739| [45] ["Those were your words-- Now watch carefully as I demonstrate them."]
336: 5753| [45] [Kazami quickly handled the hose.]
337: 5758| [45] [The water swelled like an animal and fell onto the fire in front of them.]
338: 5763| [45] [The flames that had been heartily burning with such fury earlier were now growing smaller and smaller with each passing moment.]
339: 5812| [45] [And soon enough, they were gone completely.]
340: 5881| [47] [Kazami]
341: 5884| [45] ["--Extinguishing complete."]
342: 5889| [45] [Kazami turned off the water with that declaration.]
343: 5894| [45] [Jun quickly came running back over and called out to her teammates.]
344: 5921| [47] [Jun]
345: 5924| [45] ["Man, that was too close for comfort, guys."]
346: 5932| [47] [Watase]
347: 5935| [45] ["Yeah... it's all thanks to the two of you that we got out of there alive..."]
348: 5961| [47] [Kazami]
349: 5964| [45] ["More importantly than that, Captain--"]
350: 5969| [45] [Kazami suddenly glared at Watase.]
351: 5977| [47] [Kazami]
352: 5980| [45] ["Why did you give the OK without checking the IRT scanner properly!? One wrong step back there and we'd all be dead!"]
353: 5988| [47] [Watase]
354: 5991| [45] ["I-I'm sorry... I was just thinking about how badly we needed to find some AD, so I got impatient..."]
355: 6017| [47] [Kazami]
356: 6020| [45] ["Impatient!? You screwed up because you were -impatient-!?"]
357: 6028| [47] [Kazami]
358: 6031| [45] ["You think you're fit for this line of work with such naive thoughts like that!?"]
359: 6039| [47] [Kazami]
360: 6042| [45] ["You won't be able to save the survivors like that, to say the least of keeping yourself safe!"]
361: 6050| [47] [Watase]
362: 6053| [45] ["...!"]
363: 6058| [45] [Watase found himself instinctively shutting up at the angry look on Kazami's face.]
364: 6063| [45] [It was at that moment that Jun couldn't hold herself back any longer and cut in.]
365: 6089| [47] [Jun]
366: 6092| [45] ["Hold on Lieutenant! It's not his fault! Any other day and we wouldn't have this problem!"]
367: 6118| [47] [Kazami]
368: 6121| [45] ["Yes, you're correct. Normally, he wouldn't be the kind of person to take such rash actions."]
369: 6147| [47] [Kazami]
370: 6150| [45] ["It was the same back when he tried to save Ms. Yuuri. He tried to run right into that fire without even thinking about it..."]
371: 6158| [47] [Watase]
372: 6161| [45] ["Wait, but at that moment, I just felt that I had to save her no matter what. Wanting to save someone in of itself isn't a bad thing, right?"]
373: 6187| [47] [Kazami]
374: 6190| [45] ["Of course it's not. However--"]
375: 6216| [47] [Kazami]
376: 6219| [45] ["'Someone who would throw their own life away to save survivors is no hero. Just a fool.'"]
377: 6224| [45] [Kazami's blunt statement shocked Watase.]
378: 6232| [47] [Watase]
379: 6235| [45] ["D... don't you think that's a rather harsh thing to say?"]
380: 6261| [47] [Kazami]
381: 6264| [45] ["So you really don't remember anything, do you? I'm quoting none other than -you- yourself."]
382: 6272| [47] [Watase]
383: 6275| [45] ["What?"]
384: 6280| [45] [Those words were oozing with cold intensity.]
385: 6285| [45] [He couldn't believe that he of all people had once said that.]
386: 6293| [47] [Watase]
387: 6296| [45] ["Hey, Tachibana... exactly what kind of rescue worker was the normal me like?"]
388: 6322| [47] [Kazami]
389: 6325| [45] ["Let's see. You were a calm, intellectual, and extremely cautious person."]
390: 6333| [47] [Watase]
391: 6336| [45] ["... Sounds more like a coward if you ask me."]
392: 6362| [47] [Kazami]
393: 6365| [45] ["D-don't be ridiculous!"]
394: 6391| [47] [Kazami]
395: 6394| [45] ["You were an intellectual rescue worker who always made rational decisions no matter what the crisis."]
396: 6420| [47] [Jun]
397: 6423| [45] ["She's right. Well, okay, you were a bit of a hardass, but your logic made sense."]
398: 6431| [47] [Watase]
399: 6434| [45] ["So that's who I was..."]
400: 6439| [45] [If someone as competent as Kazami was praising him this much, then he probably really had been a truly superb rescue worker.]
401: 6444| [45] [That thought alone made him curse his current self's incompetence.]
402: 6452| [47] [Watase]
403: 6455| [45] ["Okay... then I'll make sure to put safety first from now on-- my own included."]
404: 6481| [47] [Kazami]
405: 6484| [45] ["Yes, please keep doing that until your memories... until your old self comes back."]
406: 6510| [47] [Kazami]
407: 6513| [45] ["Then that's enough lecturing out of me. Let's regroup with the others."]
408: 6527| [45] [Kazami gave that order and started walking again.]
409: 6560| [45] [Watase and Jun followed behind her.]
410: 6565| [45] [His burnt left hand still ached under its glove.]
411: 6618| [47] [Watase]
412: 6619| [45] [(Goddammit, how pathetic...!)]
413: 6624| [45] [Watase thought over the situation.]
414: 6629| [45] [The normal "Watase Kasasagi" would never have screwed up as badly as he had just now.]
415: 6634| [45] [Then what kind of relationship had he had with Kazami, his lieutenant?]
416: 6654| [45] [What about with Jun? With the rest of his squad?]
417: 6659| [47] [Watase]
418: 6660| [45] [(--Were we "comrades"?)]
419: 6665| [45] [That word popped into his head.]
420: 6670| [45] [But no specific memories were coming back to him, no matter how hard he tried.]
421: 6675| [45] [All he felt was a sense of nostalgia.]
