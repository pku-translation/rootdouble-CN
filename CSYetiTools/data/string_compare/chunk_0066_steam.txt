  1:   55| [45] [Area 3, inner ring, B1-- Kazami muttered quietly as soon as they entered the place.]
  2:  123| [47] [Kazami]
  3:  126| [45] ["This is..."]
  4:  131| [45] [Kazami was looking at the room in front of her.]
  5:  136| [45] [It was the room where Dojima and those two researchers had died.]
  6:  141| [47] [Watase]
  7:  142| [45] [(There's bodies behind that door even now...!)]
  8:  193| [45] [Watase's body froze when he thought of that ghastly spectacle.]
  9:  198| [45] [But he did his best to hide his fear and spoke up.]
 10:  206| [47] [Watase]
 11:  209| [45] ["... Wait here a minute."]
 12:  236| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  239| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, what are you up to?"]
 14:  247| [47] [Watase]
 15:  250| [45] ["I'm probably wrong... but I want to check something to be safe."]
 16:  263| [45] [Just then, he thought he saw Kazami's shoulders tremble slightly.]
 17:  268| [45] [He quickly found himself worrying about her.]
 18:  276| [47] [Watase]
 19:  279| [45] ["... Tachibana, you don't have to come in if you don't want to. I'll go check it out."]
 20:  305| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  308| [45] ["Yes... my apologies."]
 22:  313| [45] [Watase walked up to the room in front of him and opened the door.]
 23:  321| [45] [Watase said that and walked over to the door when--]
 24:  347| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  350| [45] ["Captain... is it all right if I wait out here...?"]
 26:  355| [45] [It was undoubtedly painful for Kazami to see her dead squadmate's body again.]
 27:  363| [47] [Watase]
 28:  366| [45] ["... No problem. I'll check by myself."]
 29:  392| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  395| [45] ["Yes... my apologies."]
 31:  400| [45] [Watase opened the door to the room in front of him as he cursed himself for being so inconsiderate.]
 32:  446| [45] [The scene that lay behind those doors was exactly the same as the last time he'd seen it.]
 33:  451| [47] [Watase]
 34:  452| [45] [(Khh... that doesn't make it any less gruesome...!)]
 35:  457| [45] [But he could tell from a glance that none of the survivors were there.]
 36:  462| [45] [Watase quickly left the room.]
 37:  506| [45] [When he did, he saw Kazami looking at him with fear in her eyes.]
 38:  568| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  571| [45] ["... Captain."]
 40:  579| [47] [Watase]
 41:  582| [45] ["Yeah, don't worry... none of the survivors were in there."]
 42:  609| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  612| [45] ["That only figures. That room is enough to drive even the living insane."]
 44:  617| [45] [There was something unsettling about how Ukita had said that-- but Watase ignored it.]
 45:  625| [47] [Watase]
 46:  628| [45] ["Anyway, there's only two rooms in this block. Let's check the other one out."]
 47:  654| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  657| [45] ["... Yes."]
 49:  662| [45] [The team then headed for that room.]
 50:  707| [45] [--What lay there was a large laboratory.]
 51:  712| [45] [There were a lot of blind spots, meaning it'd be hard to tell right away if anyone happened to be collapsed behind one of them.]
 52:  720| [47] [Watase]
 53:  723| [45] ["Think it's possible anything could be here?"]
 54:  791| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  794| [45] ["Yes. Make sure you check behind everything here."]
 56:  821| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  824| [45] ["Roger."]
 58:  867| [45] [The team then began their search of the room.]
 59:  872| [45] [But there was no hide nor hair of the survivors or any AD.]
 60:  877| [47] [Watase]
 61:  878| [45] [(Khh... then while I'm at it....)]
 62:  883| [45] [Watase decided to look for "information".]
 63:  888| [45] [Several documents were scattered on the floor deeper in the room.]
 64:  893| [45] [Perhaps their pages held a hint to escaping this facility that Watase's team didn't know about.]
 65:  898| [47] [Watase]
 66:  899| [45] [(Is there anything useful here...?)]
 67:  904| [45] [Watase walked over to the documents, started picking them up one by one, then read them.]
 68:  909| [45] [But what they said was--]
 69:  947| [85] [　]
 70:  950| [45] [--Area 3 Personnel Social Gathering: Hike Around Lake Rokumei--]
 71:  953| [85] [               ]
 72:  954| [45] [(April 2015)]
 73:  957| [45] [--Senior Fellow Training Seminar: Accepting Applications--]

 76:  964| [45] [--Dr. Miyoko Fanclub: Meeting Notification--]

 82:  978| [45] [--Special Observation Target Na2: 3rd Periodic Report--]
 83:  981| [85] [               ]

 85:  985| [45] [--Concerning the abolition of print medium--]
 86:  988| [85] [             ]
 87:  989| [45] [(December 2021)]
 88: 1015| [45] [--All of them had meaningless pieces of information, incomprehensible to Watase.]
 89: 1020| [45] [What's more, they were all fairly old.]
 90: 1025| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1026| [45] [(Guess I shouldn't get my hopes up...)]
 92: 1031| [45] [Watase picked up another paper as he thought this.]
 93: 1039| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1042| [45] ["Hmm... 'NBC Outbreak: Security Manual'?"]
 95: 1047| [45] [Kazami peeked over his shoulder and spoke up.]
 96: 1110| [47] [Kazami]
 97: 1113| [45] ["Captain, what's that you have there?"]
 98: 1121| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1124| [45] ["Not sure. What's NBC anyway?"]
100: 1150| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1153| [45] ["Oh, NBC stands for 'Nuclear' 'Biological' and 'Chemical'."]
102: 1161| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1164| [45] ["So for example, whenever they refer to an NBC disaster, that's a general term for a disaster caused by nuclear, biological, or chemical substances."]
104: 1169| [45] [In other words, this manual probably described security measures to be taken during an accident much like this one.]
105: 1174| [47] [Watase]
106: 1175| [45] [(But I thought they valued evacuation more than security in these kinds of situations...)]
107: 1180| [45] [Watase's thoughts were interrupted by a voice behind him.]
108: 1233| [47] [Ukita]
109: 1236| [45] ["What are you two doing!?"]
110: 1241| [45] [They turned around in surprise to see Ukita looking at them furiously.]
111: 1249| [47] [Watase]
112: 1252| [45] ["Oh, uh, I just figured there might be a hint to escaping this place in here."]
113: 1278| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1281| [45] ["We don't have time for that now, right?"]
115: 1307| [47] [Ukita]
116: 1310| [45] ["And besides, all the print materials in this facility are old anyway. They abolished print nine years ago and decided to digitize everything from then on."]
117: 1318| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1321| [45] ["They haven't gotten around to disposing of these documents yet, but they're so old that the information's useless anyway."]
119: 1329| [47] [Watase]
120: 1332| [45] ["But what about the disaster prevention manuals? The ones we found said '2030 Edition' on them."]
121: 1340| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1343| [45] ["Those are the only emergency procedure documents, so they always distribute printed copies of the latest version."]
123: 1351| [47] [Ukita]
124: 1354| [45] ["But that, along with everything else in this facility, is supposed to be top secret."]
125: 1380| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1383| [45] ["I believe I told you earlier that digging too deeply into things could have severe consequences."]
127: 1409| [47] [Kazami]
128: 1412| [45] ["But this is an emergency, so regardless of the policy--"]
129: 1438| [47] [Ukita]
130: 1441| [45] ["This isn't a simple threat or a joke! I'm telling you this for your own safety!"]
131: 1449| [47] [Watase]
132: 1452| [45] ["!!"]
133: 1478| [47] [Ukita]
134: 1481| [45] ["... You shouldn't take a government-managed research facility lightly."]
135: 1507| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1510| [45] ["Unless you don't like the idea of living in peace, that is...!"]
137: 1515| [45] [Ukita's eyes had an almost bizarre intensity to them as he spoke.]
138: 1520| [45] [As if to say that this world contained far more frightening situations than the disaster they were trapped in--]
139: 1525| [45] [Watase was overpowered by that look and found himself replying on instinct.]
140: 1533| [47] [Watase]
141: 1536| [45] ["G-got it... sorry."]
142: 1544| [47] [Watase]
143: 1547| [45] ["Let's finish up searching this room and move on."]
144: 1573| [47] [Kazami]
145: 1576| [45] ["... Yes."]
146: 1581| [45] [Watase still felt dissatisfied with the situation--]
147: 1586| [45] [--but he and the others left the room for the time being.]
