  0:   64| [45] [--And then, the fateful day had finally come.]
  1:   69| [45] [In the early hours of September 16, Ena headed to LABO with Kuroda and Higa.]
  2:  104| [45] [They were stopped at the entrance by a LABO security guard...]
  3:  109| [45] [But using the false warrant, they half-forced their way inside.]
  4:  176| [45] [They were given white lab coats to change into and were taken all the way to Area 6's inner ring.]
  5:  181| [45] [But once they had arrived there, the researchers called them to a halt once more.]
  6:  186| [45] [According to them, not even ESP Bureau commissioners could be allowed further in, "for the sake of preserving secrecy".]
  7:  191| [45] [Now that it had come to this, Ena was about to threaten them with her gun and force them to open up the path to Area N, but--]
  8:  228| [45] [Before she could, she suddenly heard a thunderous roar.]
  9:  233| [47] [Ena]
 10:  236| [45] ["!!? Wh-what's that sound!?"]
 11:  241| [45] [As if to answer that question, more and more sounds echoed forth.]
 12:  302| [45] [The automatic disaster prevention system began broadcasting warnings like mad.]
 13:  313| [47] [Automatic PA]
 14:  316| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B1 Area 1."]
 15:  321| [47] [Automatic PA]
 16:  324| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 3."]
 17:  329| [47] [Automatic PA]
 18:  332| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 19:  337| [47] [Automatic PA]
 20:  340| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 2."]
 21:  391| [45] [--Ena was caught completely off guard.]
 22:  396| [45] [She had not expected such a thing to happen today of all days.]
 23:  401| [45] [Was it a coincidence? An inevitability?--]
 24:  406| [45] [Either way, the ESP Bureau members got dragged into the terrorist attack.]
 25:  470| [45] [The researchers who had called them to a halt began to scatter in all directions like headless chickens.]
 26:  475| [47] [Kuroda]
 27:  478| [45] ["Wh-what in the world... is going on here!?"]
 28:  483| [47] [Ena]
 29:  486| [45] ["I-I don't know... but it might be a Q terrorist attack...!"]
 30:  491| [47] [Higa]
 31:  494| [45] ["Q!? You mean those bastards know this place is a BC research facility!?"]
 32:  499| [47] [Ena]
 33:  502| [45] ["That's only a possibility."]
 34:  507| [45] [Ena, Kuroda, and Higa had heard rumors that Q had infiltrated the city.]
 35:  512| [45] [But while Q may have infiltrated the city, LABO couldn't have just conspicuously strengthened security. That would be the same as installing a sign saying "This is a BC facility".]
 36:  517| [45] [And perhaps LABO had maintained security at normal levels for that very reason, but--]
 37:  522| [47] [Ena]
 38:  523| [45] [(Did they take advantage of that window of opportunity...?)]
 39:  528| [47] [Kuroda]
 40:  531| [45] ["... Tch! Then let's just look for an exit for now!"]
 41:  536| [47] [Higa]
 42:  539| [45] ["In case we do encounter any terrorists, well, it might be completely out of our scope of work, but... I guess let's try and see if we can apprehend them."]
 43:  544| [47] [Ena]
 44:  547| [45] ["Understood!"]
 45:  552| [45] [The commissioners broke off into a run to search for an exit.]
 46:  671| [45] [--But they ran across a huge fire in the factory--]
 47:  676| [45] [Ena got separated from Kuroda and Higa.]
 48:  681| [47] [Ena]
 49:  684| [45] ["Chief! Commissioner Higa! Where are you!?"]
 50:  689| [45] [Voices called out in response to Ena from across the fire.]
 51:  694| [47] [Kuroda]
 52:  697| [45] ["Tsubakiyama!! We can't regroup like this! Let's split up and search for exits separately!"]
 53:  702| [47] [Higa]
 54:  705| [45] ["Wait for us on the surface!"]
 55:  710| [47] [Ena]
 56:  713| [45] ["U-understood!"]
 57:  719| [45] [And a little while after they parted--]
 58:  764| [45] [--an ominous siren blared out.]
 59:  781| [47] [Automatic PA]
 60:  784| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
 61:  789| [47] [Automatic PA]
 62:  792| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
 63:  797| [47] [Automatic PA]
 64:  800| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
 65:  805| [45] [And thus, Ena became trapped underground.]
 66:  864| [45] [Before she could regroup with Kuroda and Higa, she was chased by fires in the connecting passageway.]
 67:  869| [47] [Ena]
 68:  872| [45] ["*cough*! *cough*!!"]
 69:  877| [47] [Ena]
 70:  880| [45] ["Ugh, damn... it..."]
 71:  885| [47] [Ena]
 72:  888| [45] ["Like hell am I gonna die here!"]
 73:  893| [45] [Ena tossed off the lab coat given to her by LABO and made a mad dash away from the fire and smoke...]
 74:  904| [45] [And then she pulled the hose out of a hydrant and began fighting the fires herself.]
 75:  954| [45] [After extinguishing the fires, she began planning how to escape from the connecting passageway--]
 76:  965| [45] [--when eventually, rescue workers appeared.]
 77: 1093| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1096| [45] ["--what's your name?"]
 79: 1101| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1104| [45] ["... 'Ena Tsubakiyama'. And you guys?"]
 81: 1112| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1115| [45] ["I'm Lieutenant Tachibana. This is Ensign Moribe."]
 83: 1123| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1126| [45] ["And this girl is Yuuri, a civilian we found trapped down here."]
 85: 1131| [47] [Ena]
 86: 1134| [45] ["A civilian? So there's someone besides me who was caught up in this incident?"]
 87: 1142| [47] [Yuuri]
 88: 1145| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
 89: 1150| [45] [The girl named "Yuuri" looked at Ena with fearful eyes.]
 90: 1155| [47] [Ena]
 91: 1156| [45] [(Yuuri... The same name as "Yuuri Kotono"?)]
 92: 1161| [47] [Ena]
 93: 1162| [45] [(Something's bothering me. Looks like the best course of action is to put on the veil of an ordinary person for a while and work with them for now.)]
 94: 1167| [45] [Besides, she had to search for an exit anyway, and she was also worried about Kuroda's and Higa's safety as well.]
 95: 1172| [45] [Ena decided to work with this group.]
 96: 1322| [45] [--She took the AD just as Kazami had instructed.]
 97: 1327| [45] [Through her work experience, Ena had already gained knowledge about the dangers of WX particles and the effects of AD, among other things.]
 98: 1332| [45] [And naturally, she also knew how LABO had maintained the facade that it was all related to nuclear power.]
 99: 1337| [47] [Ena]
100: 1338| [45] [(But it's not like I can tell everybody about that...)]
101: 1343| [45] [If any ordinary person were to know about those things, they'd immediately be targeted by LABO for the purposes of concealing information.]
102: 1348| [45] [In any case, the dangers were still real, and they still had to keep administering AD either way.]
103: 1353| [45] [With that thought in mind, she decided to play along and kept going for a while...]
104: 1358| [45] [And eventually, she saw Kuroda and Higa again.]
105: 1506| [47] [All 3]
106: 1509| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"]
107: 1514| [45] [Ena couldn't help but scream.]
108: 1519| [45] [For when she saw them again, Kuroda and Higa's appearances had completely changed.]
109: 1524| [45] [Perhaps they were masquerading as LABO researchers, considering they were still wearing their provided lab coats.]
110: 1529| [45] [But the lab coats were no longer white, having been stained deep red by the blood oozing from their countless gunshot wounds.]
111: 1534| [47] [Ena]
112: 1535| [45] [(They were shot...?)]
113: 1540| [45] [Given that they were lying with their heads turned towards the door, it was possible that they'd been trying to escape from the room.]
114: 1545| [45] [The various sized holes in their body, especially the big ones in their stomachs, exposed their rust-colored viscera.]
115: 1550| [45] [But Ena couldn't peel her eyes from the dead bodies.]
116: 1555| [47] [Ena]
117: 1556| [45] [(... What's any of this supposed to mean...!?)]
118: 1561| [47] [Ena]
119: 1562| [45] [(Why were Chief Kuroda and Commissioner Higa shot to death, but the rescue worker alone had his neck snapped?)]
120: 1567| [47] [Ena]
121: 1568| [45] [(I can only think of two answers...)]
122: 1573| [47] [Ena]
123: 1574| [45] [(All three of these people were together when a terrorist came in, shot Chief Kuroda and Higa, and massacred the rescue worker.)]
124: 1579| [47] [Ena]
125: 1580| [45] [(Or perhaps the rescue worker was the terrorist himself... Chief Kuroda and Higa tried to apprehend the terrorist and fought him barehanded.)]
126: 1585| [47] [Ena]
127: 1586| [45] [(And the scuffle ended a draw-- with all three of them dead.)]
128: 1591| [45] [--She had a feeling the answer was more likely the latter.]
129: 1596| [45] [If she remembered correctly, her father's journal stated that Kuroda had transferred from the National Police Agency and had been an expert in martial arts since childhood.]
130: 1601| [45] [And Higa used to be with Public Security. It wouldn't have been surprising if he had matching strength too.]
131: 1606| [47] [Ena]
132: 1607| [45] [(I don't know the truth of the situation... but there's one thing I know for sure:)]
133: 1612| [47] [Ena]
134: 1613| [45] [(Chief Kuroda and Commissioner Higa were killed by the terrorists...!)]
135: 1618| [45] [Ena gritted her teeth.]
136: 1716| [47] [Ena]
137: 1717| [45] [(... Please rest in peace... I swear I will avenge you...!)]
138: 1722| [47] [Ena]
139: 1723| [45] [(I swear I won't let there be any more victims than this...!)]
140: 1728| [45] [She decided to keep up the facade of an ordinary person as she searched for the culprit.]
141: 1733| [45] [Or at least she tried to, but--]
142: 1799| [45] [--despite her determination, a new victim came up.]
143: 1804| [45] [Watase looked at the dead body and muttered dumbfoundedly.]
144: 1809| [47] [Watase]
145: 1812| [45] ["Wh-who is this girl...?"]
146: 1817| [45] [Ena didn't know either. But she had a hunch.]
147: 1822| [47] [Ena]
148: 1823| [45] [(This girl's clothes... look almost like a hospital gown...!)]
149: 1828| [47] [Ena]
150: 1829| [45] [(Could it be that this girl... was a test subject confined in LABO!?)]
151: 1834| [45] [In that case, it was highly possible that Q had killed her.]
152: 1839| [47] [Ena]
153: 1840| [45] [(Then was Ms. Yuuri a test subject too...!?)]
154: 1845| [47] [Ena]
155: 1846| [45] [(Could the cause of Captain Kasasagi's amnesia be related to the test subjects?)]
156: 1851| [47] [Ena]
157: 1852| [45] [(If his amnesia is due to Senses Sympathy... then who erased his memories, and why?)]
158: 1857| [47] [Ena]
159: 1858| [45] [(Was it this girl before she died...? Or could it have been Ms. Yuuri?)]
160: 1909| [45] [Several doubts seized Ena's mind.]
161: 1914| [45] [She considered revealing her true identity and using her gun as a threat to seek out the criminal-- but that was too risky.]
162: 1919| [45] [If any of the members of their group were either a terrorist or an Ability Level 6 Communicator, then that whole plan had a high chance of backfiring on her.]
163: 1924| [47] [Ena]
164: 1925| [45] [(... Now that I think about it, everyone here right now is suspicious...)]
165: 1930| [47] [Ena]
166: 1931| [45] [(If that rescue worker was a terrorist, then Captain Kasasagi, Ms. Tachibana, and Ms. Moribe might be with the terrorists as well.)]
167: 1936| [47] [Ena]
168: 1937| [45] [(And then there's Mr. Ukita, a possible sleeper agent, as well as Ms. Yuuri, an unidentified girl... There's nobody here I can rely on as an ally...!)]
169: 2021| [45] [But if she were to pick someone she could depend on from among them--]
170: 2026| [47] [Ena]
171: 2027| [45] [(Ms. Tachibana...?)]
172: 2032| [47] [Ena]
173: 2033| [45] [(... No...)]
174: 2038| [47] [Ena]
175: 2039| [45] [(... Perhaps Captain Kasasagi...?)]
176: 2044| [45] [Ena had watched Watase for the three hours since they had met.]
177: 2049| [45] [With the exception of his amnesia, there was nothing suspicious about his speech and conduct.]
178: 2054| [45] [In fact, he seemed like an ideal rescue worker, rushing to save other people regardless of the danger.]
179: 2059| [47] [Ena]
180: 2060| [45] [(What'll it be, Captain Kasasagi... Can I trust you?)]
181: 2106| [45] [After they left the cargo lift room, Ena made up her mind and tried to scope him out.]
182: 2111| [45] [By acting like a normal woman.]
183: 2185| [47] [Ena]
184: 2188| [45] ["... Captain Kasasagi, I'm scared..."]
185: 2196| [47] [Watase]
186: 2199| [45] ["Yeah... Can't blame you."]
187: 2225| [47] [Watase]
188: 2228| [45] ["We've lost our escape exit and we keep finding murder victims... It's gotta be tough on a woman."]
189: 2233| [47] [Ena]
190: 2236| [45] ["It is..."]
191: 2241| [47] [Watase]
192: 2242| [45] ["..."]
193: 2247| [47] [Ena]
194: 2250| [45] ["... Hey, Captain Kasasagi, if the culprit tried to attack us..."]
195: 2255| [47] [Ena]
196: 2258| [45] ["Would you protect me?"]
197: 2284| [47] [Watase]
198: 2287| [45] ["Yeah. I promise."]
199: 2292| [45] [Those reassuring words soaked into Ena's heart.]
200: 2300| [45] [She was only armed with a single gun.]
201: 2305| [45] [She couldn't risk an offensive when she didn't even know her enemy's numbers.]
202: 2310| [47] [Ena]
203: 2311| [45] [(But still... I will apprehend the culprit, at all costs.)]
204: 2316| [47] [Ena]
205: 2317| [45] [(It's part of my job as a commissioner.)]
206: 2322| [45] [Ena felt the weight of her gun as she made her decision.]
207: 2327| [47] [Ena]
208: 2328| [45] [(... Protect me, Father...!)]
209: 2333| [45] [And thus Ena began her lonely battle, knowing that anybody could be an enemy.]
210: 2542| [45] [--And thus, as I go back through these memories, and various feelings intensify--]
211: 2547| [45] [A new memory rises up from the innermost depths of Ena's mind.]
