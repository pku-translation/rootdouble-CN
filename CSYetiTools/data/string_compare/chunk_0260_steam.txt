  1:  126| [45] [--When Watase reported Yuuri's death to everyone-- their eyes widened in shock.]
  2:  182| [47] [Ukita]
  3:  185| [45] ["Impossible! How can she be dead!?"]
  4:  211| [47] [Ena]
  5:  214| [45] ["Was it an accident!? Was she murdered!?"]
  6:  222| [47] [Watase]
  7:  225| [45] ["I-I don't know... but I found her body... That's a fact..."]
  8:  251| [47] [Jun]
  9:  254| [45] ["Wh-where!? Where did you find her!?"]
 10:  262| [47] [Watase]
 11:  265| [45] ["Come with me... it's this way..."]
 12:  308| [45] [--It all went downhill from there.]
 13:  400| [47] [Watase]
 14:  403| [45] ["... The... the body's gone...!"]
 15:  429| [47] [Ukita]
 16:  432| [45] ["Good grief... are you sure you weren't just seeing things?"]
 17:  440| [47] [Watase]
 18:  443| [45] ["I-I'm not lying! There really was a body here, I swear!"]
 19:  451| [47] [Watase]
 20:  454| [45] ["There was a girl with blood pouring down her head! She was dead no matter how you looked at..."]
 21:  480| [47] [Ena]
 22:  483| [45] ["Blood? But I don't see any bloodstains anywhere..."]
 23:  491| [47] [Watase]
 24:  494| [45] ["...???"]
 25:  499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  500| [45] [(Shit...! How did I not see this coming...!?)]
 27:  543| [45] [The problems kept piling on as Natsuhiko stood by, unable to do anything--]
 28:  602| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  603| [45] [(!? The AD's gone!?)]
 30:  611| [47] [Watase]
 31:  614| [45] ["This can't be happening...!"]
 32:  622| [47] [Watase]
 33:  625| [45] ["Dammit, how the hell did this happen!?"]
 34:  717| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  720| [45] ["'How', you ask? It's obvious! Someone stole the AD, that's how!"]
 36:  746| [47] [Jun]
 37:  749| [45] ["He's right, and what's more... the culprit must be one of us."]
 38:  757| [47] [Watase]
 39:  760| [45] ["... No, there's no way that one of us did it."]
 40:  803| [45] [But when Watase took everyone there to dispel their suspicions--]
 41:  879| [45] [--He came face-to-face with the "truth" that denied the "illusion" Natsuhiko had bestowed upon him.]
 42:  887| [47] [Watase]
 43:  890| [45] ["... Huh!?"]
 44:  933| [47] [Jun]
 45:  936| [45] ["He didn't... find a body...!?"]
 46: 1025| [45] [Watase was cast in doubt.]
 47: 1051| [47] [Jun]
 48: 1054| [45] ["Were you... were you lying to us...?"]
 49: 1062| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1065| [45] ["N-no..."]
 51: 1154| [45] [They pressed him further.]
 52: 1180| [47] [Ukita]
 53: 1183| [45] ["You claimed you went down to the basement to rescue survivors. But perhaps that's yet another lie--"]
 54: 1191| [47] [Ukita]
 55: 1194| [45] ["And in reality, you came down for a completely different purpose."]
 56: 1202| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1205| [45] ["Wh-what different purpose...?"]
 58: 1231| [47] [Ukita]
 59: 1234| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? To kill."]
 60: 1323| [45] [And at the end, what Ukita and Jun thrust before Watase--]
 61: 1349| [47] [Jun]
 62: 1352| [45] ["Come on, tell me... Captain... did you really come here to save lives...?"]
 63: 1357| [45] [--were glares of rage and bloodlust.]
 64: 1362| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1363| [45] [(O-oh crap...!)]
 66: 1368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1369| [45] [(The situation's even worse than the last time Watase was cast under doubt...!)]
 68: 1374| [45] [But Natsuhiko was painfully aware of why they'd doubt Watase.]
 69: 1379| [45] [After all--]
 70: 1484| [45] [--Watase had shot both him and Mashiro.]
 71: 1619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1620| [45] [(...!!!)]
 73: 1625| [45] [Natsuhiko vividly recalled Mashiro's tearful voice and Salyu's wounded body.]
 74: 1630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1631| [45] [(But now... Watase and I are in the same boat.)]
 76: 1636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1637| [45] [(And I hate to admit it, but the current Watase is a reliable rescue worker...)]
 78: 1642| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1643| [45] [(Now that I have no body of my own, I can't save Salyu or Yuuri without his help...!)]
 80: 1648| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1649| [45] [(So I need to do everything I can to clear this bastard of suspicion...!)]
 82: 1654| [45] [He knew he had to, but he didn't know how.]
 83: 1659| [45] [But right after that-- someone completely unexpected stood up for Watase.]
 84: 1740| [47] [Ena]
 85: 1743| [45] ["Hold on, you two. You guys are acting a little weird."]
 86: 1801| [47] [Ena]
 87: 1804| [45] ["And yet you turned your backs on him the moment the AD disappeared? What kind of sane person does that?"]
 88: 1809| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1810| [45] [(!! No, Professor! If you stick up for Watase in this situation--!)]
 90: 1815| [45] [Jun and Ukita glared at Ena.]
 91: 1841| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1844| [45] ["Why are -you- on the Captain's side after hearing everything we've just said? I mean, you barely know the guy, right?"]
 93: 1870| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1873| [45] ["Unless... the two of you are in cahoots or something?"]
 95: 1899| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1902| [45] ["I see, now I get it. I always did think you were acting strange...!"]
 97: 1928| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1931| [45] ["Now I finally understand! You two are planning to just save yourselves and leave the rest of us to die!"]
 99: 1939| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1942| [45] ["You were the ones who hid the AD, weren't you!? All so you could have it all to yourselves!"]
101: 2060| [45] [Jun and Ukita sidled up to Watase and Ena, prompting Natsuhiko to shout a warning to Watase.]
102: 2127| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 2130| [45] [{It's too dangerous... take Prof. Tsubakiyama and run!}]
104: 2210| [47] [Watase]
105: 2213| [45] ["!"]
106: 2218| [45] [Heeding Natsuhiko, Watase took Ena's hand and ran.]
107: 2311| [47] [Jun]
108: 2314| [45] ["Trying to run!?"]
109: 2322| [47] [Ukita]
110: 2325| [45] ["Not good! Hold them down!"]
111: 2373| [45] [And with those voices at their backs, Watase and Ena fled.]
