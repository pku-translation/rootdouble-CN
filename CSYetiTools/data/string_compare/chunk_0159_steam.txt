  1:   86| [45] [As they walked through town, Mashiro turned to Salyu and mused.]
  2:  112| [47] [Mashiro]
  3:  115| [45] ["Hey look, Salyu. Everyone's turning their heads~"]
  4:  141| [47] [Salyu]
  5:  144| [45] ["..."]
  6:  149| [45] [Salyu shyly looked away.]
  7:  362| [45] [Salyu had borrowed the dressing room to change into her new clothes right away.]
  8:  418| [45] [--And not just her, but Mashiro too.]
  9:  504| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  507| [45] ["Wait, why did you have to change too? No, before that, when did you even buy that?"]
 11:  548| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  551| [45] ["Why not? Picking out clothes for Salyu got me in the mood to dress up too, see?"]
 13:  559| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  562| [45] ["And naturally, I paid out of my own pocket. How's it look? How's it look?"]
 15:  588| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  591| [45] ["... Mashiro, umm, I think you're cute too."]
 17:  617| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  620| [45] ["Oh? You flatter me~ Your big sis is super happy."]
 19:  652| [45] [With Mashiro patting her on her head, Salyu looked just as cute as a typical girl her age.]
 20:  657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  658| [45] [(Looks like Mashiro's completely lowered her guard around Salyu, huh...)]
 22:  663| [45] [But Natsuhiko still had some misgivings.]
 23:  740| [45] [--He still recalled what happened the day before yesterday in the back of his head.]
 24:  745| [45] [He remembered seeing Salyu, the only one in the sea of onlookers who calmly looked at him instead of the accident--]
 25:  861| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  862| [45] [(It's bizarre no matter how I think about it...)]
 27:  867| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  868| [45] [(Isn't it strange for her to look straight at me and me alone right after a big accident like that?)]
 29:  873| [45] [She seemed like an outsider coming to disrupt his peaceful days, but perhaps there'd be a reason for that too if he looked back far enough.]
 30:  878| [45] [Besides, even if she did come to "protect" him, there shouldn't have been a reason to keep an eye on him from that far away.]
 31:  883| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  884| [45] [(I want a logical explanation...)]
 33:  889| [45] [Unless he had that explanation, he wouldn't be able to open his heart to Salyu.]
 34:  905| [45] [And so he made up his mind and asked her.]
 35:  992| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  995| [45] ["Hey, Salyu, got a moment?"]
 37: 1021| [47] [Salyu]
 38: 1024| [45] ["What is it?"]
 39: 1032| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40: 1035| [45] ["There was an accident here the day before yesterday... You were here back then too, weren't you?"]
 41: 1061| [47] [Salyu]
 42: 1064| [45] ["... What about it?"]
 43: 1090| [47] [Mashiro]
 44: 1093| [45] ["Huh? Wait, Salyu, you were there at the scene of the accident too?"]
 45: 1119| [47] [Mashiro]
 46: 1122| [45] ["Ah, then that means you saw me panicking too--"]
 47: 1154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48: 1157| [45] ["Hold off for a second, Mashiro, there's something important I need to say."]
 49: 1180| [45] [Mashiro gulped and fell silent at Natsuhiko's subdued voice.]
 50: 1188| [47] [Mashiro]
 51: 1191| [45] ["Ah... sorry, continue."]
 52: 1199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53: 1202| [45] ["Thanks. So, Salyu..."]
 54: 1234| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1237| [45] ["Back then you didn't give the accident a second look. Instead you looked my way, right?"]
 56: 1263| [47] [Salyu]
 57: 1266| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 58: 1274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1277| [45] ["All the other onlookers had their eyes on the accident, so why were you alone looking at me?"]
 60: 1285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1288| [45] ["It's been bugging me ever since. Can you tell me your reasons?"]
 62: 1311| [47] [Salyu]
 63: 1312| [45] ["..."]
 64: 1317| [45] [Salyu silently pondered-- and then she spoke with a sigh.]
 65: 1343| [47] [Salyu]
 66: 1346| [45] ["... It was just a coincidence that I happened to be at the scene of the accident."]
 67: 1354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1357| [45] ["A coincidence?"]
 69: 1365| [47] [Salyu]
 70: 1368| [45] ["Yeah. That day, I was walking through the city that I'd soon be living in."]
 71: 1394| [47] [Salyu]
 72: 1397| [45] ["And then that accident happened. It's rude to stare at accidents, so I just meant to pass through, but..."]
 73: 1423| [47] [Salyu]
 74: 1426| [45] ["That's when I heard a tremendous 'voice' and stopped in surprise."]
 75: 1434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1437| [45] ["--Oh."]
 77: 1442| [45] [The more he thought about it, the more that made sense.]
 78: 1447| [45] [Even Natsuhiko himself was surprised at how he had used telepathy.]
 79: 1455| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1458| [45] ["Then, in that case... were you looking for the source of that voice? That telepathy?"]
 81: 1484| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1487| [45] ["Yeah. I was looking around and we happened to make eye contact."]
 83: 1513| [47] [Salyu]
 84: 1516| [45] ["You looked like the professor's son from how she described you, so I thought 'could that possibly be him'?"]
 85: 1542| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1545| [45] ["It would be weird to go out of my way to ask you, so I gave up and left. That's all."]
 87: 1596| [45] [Salyu quickly explained herself in one breath.]
 88: 1672| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1675| [45] ["Ohh, so that's all. I was wondering why you were acting so strange around Salyu...%NIs that what was on your mind, Natsuhiko?"]
 90: 1683| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1686| [45] ["Ah, well... yeah, I guess it did bother me."]
 92: 1709| [45] [Now that the mystery had been solved, the actual answer seemed to be quite trivial.]
 93: 1717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1720| [45] ["But still... I think anyone would be bothered if they were in my position."]
 95: 1746| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1749| [45] ["If someone got into an accident before your eyes and then gave you some bizarre warning,%Nand to top it all off, an unfamiliar girl holding some kind of stuffed animal stared at you..."]
 97: 1754| [45] [Natsuhiko glanced at Salyu's stuffed animal.]
 98: 1966| [45] [Just then--]
 99: 1971| [47] [Stuffed Animal]
100: 1974| [45] ["Kyu, kyukyu...!"]
101: 1979| [45] [Said stuffed animal made a strange sound.]
102: 2063| [47] [Mashiro]
103: 2066| [45] ["Geh, it squeaked!?"]
104: 2074| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 2077| [45] ["Ah, it did it again..."]
106: 2082| [45] [Natsuhiko remembered it had done so before.]
107: 2168| [45] [Last night when he talked to Salyu in front of the house, that stuffed animal did indeed squeak.]
108: 2255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 2256| [45] [(That thing has been bugging me too...)]
110: 2264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 2267| [45] ["Say, what exactly is that stuffed animal? It seems to squeak from time to time..."]
112: 2337| [47] [Salyu]
113: 2340| [45] ["It's not a stuffed animal. It's a device called 'ARMS'."]
114: 2348| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 2351| [45] ["Arms?"]
116: 2359| [47] [Salyu]
117: 2362| [45] ["'Atmosphere Reading Mascot System'"]
118: 2388| [47] [Mashiro]
119: 2391| [45] ["Hmm, so you mean it can pick up on moods and stuff?"]
120: 2399| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2402| [45] ["Huh...? What's that supposed to mean?"]
122: 2407| [45] [The stuffed animal squeaked again at Natsuhiko's confusion.]
123: 2412| [47] [Stuffed Animal]
124: 2415| [45] ["Kyuu..."]
125: 2441| [47] [Salyu]
126: 2444| [45] ["Natsuhiko, this ARMS device just looked at you and made a confused squeak, right?"]
127: 2452| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 2455| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
129: 2481| [47] [Salyu]
130: 2484| [45] ["It analyzed your voice and facial expression and made the judgment that 'Natsuhiko is confused'."]
131: 2492| [47] [Salyu]
132: 2495| [45] ["And so it said 'kyuu' to tell me that."]
133: 2521| [47] [Salyu]
134: 2524| [45] ["In other words, it's an automatic response device that reads other people's emotions and reacts accordingly."]
135: 2532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2535| [45] ["I see. So it's basically a high level pet robot, then."]
137: 2567| [45] [Pet robots in general had gotten quite popular recently.]
138: 2572| [45] [Natsuhiko had heard that their functionalities had been advancing over the years, so he assumed that this was just one of those advancements.]
139: 2598| [47] [Mashiro]
140: 2601| [45] ["But that sure sounds new. I've never even heard of an 'emotion reading' function, you know?"]
141: 2609| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2612| [45] ["Is that even possible?"]
143: 2638| [47] [Salyu]
144: 2641| [45] ["The emotions people have, the impressions they give, and their 'atmospheres' in their entirety have been a topic of research in computer science since the 20th Century."]
145: 2649| [47] [Salyu]
146: 2652| [45] ["But it wasn't until very recently that those things could be quantified."]
147: 2660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2663| [45] ["So this is a cutting edge device, then..."]
149: 2689| [47] [Mashiro]
150: 2692| [45] ["Sounds expensive~ I understand why you'd want to carry it around with you everywhere."]
151: 2718| [47] [Salyu]
152: 2721| [45] ["I don't particularly carry it because it's expensive. I carry it because I need it."]
153: 2729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2732| [45] ["Because you need it?"]
155: 2758| [47] [Salyu]
156: 2761| [45] ["... To be honest, I'm very poor at understanding the nuances of people's emotions and facial expressions."]
157: 2769| [47] [Salyu]
158: 2772| [45] ["It's thanks to this thing that I can finally communicate properly with people."]
159: 2780| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2783| [45] ["Huh... really?"]
161: 2809| [47] [Mashiro]
162: 2812| [45] ["Is it because you lived in France? Is it hard to understand Japanese facial expressions?"]
163: 2838| [47] [Salyu]
164: 2841| [45] ["--Yes. Something like that."]
165: 2867| [47] [Salyu]
166: 2870| [45] ["That's why I was uneasy about adapting to a new life. But with ARMS, I think I can somehow manage."]
167: 2878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2881| [45] ["... So that's how it was."]
169: 2886| [45] [Natsuhiko felt as if he had seen a side of Salyu he had never seen before.]
170: 2985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2986| [45] [(She felt uneasy... so I guess she wasn't putting on airs after all.)]
172: 2991| [45] [Natsuhiko felt like he finally understood a lot of things.]
173: 3099| [45] [Like why she had seemed so pouty at school.]
174: 3184| [45] [Why the ARMS device had squeaked when they talked last night, and why Salyu reacted the way she did.]
175: 3320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 3321| [45] [(Those were all signs of anxiety... that's why she acted that way.)]
177: 3347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 3350| [45] ["... I guess you've got it tough too, huh Salyu."]
179: 3376| [47] [Salyu]
180: 3379| [45] ["No, it's not particularly difficult. Your concern is unnecessary."]
181: 3387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 3390| [45] ["Ah, I see..."]
183: 3413| [45] [--But perhaps she really didn't have that innocent charm after all.]
184: 3418| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 3419| [45] [(Well, I guess that's just how she is.)]
186: 3424| [45] [Mashiro smirked as Natsuhiko reached that conclusion.]
187: 3450| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 3453| [45] ["Now then, looks like we've cleared up all those misunderstandings. So now we can begin our friendship anew, right?"]
189: 3461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 3464| [45] ["Friendship, huh...?"]
191: 3490| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 3493| [45] ["What, you got a problem with that?"]
193: 3501| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 3504| [45] ["No, not really."]
195: 3509| [45] [If only it were that simple to form friendships.]
196: 3517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 3520| [45] ["Well... now that we've settled all those things that've been bugging me, I guess we should start heading home."]
198: 3546| [47] [Mashiro]
199: 3549| [45] ["Ah, sure."]
200: 3572| [47] [Salyu]
201: 3573| [45] ["..."]
202: 3642| [45] [The three of them left the shopping center together.]
203: 3765| [45] [--That day, Mashiro cooked a luxurious dinner as a welcoming party for Salyu.]
204: 3770| [45] [After everyone had eaten--]
205: 3775| [45] [It was time for Mashiro to go back home.]
206: 3891| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 3894| [45] ["Okay, Natsuhiko, Salyu, Yuuri. See you tomorrow."]
208: 3902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3905| [45] ["Yeah, see you tomorrow."]
210: 3931| [47] [Salyu]
211: 3934| [45] ["Mm."]
212: 3960| [47] [Yuuri]
213: 3963| [45] ["Later, Mashiron~"]
214: 4012| [45] [Mashiro left the house with those voices at her back.]
215: 4086| [47] [Salyu]
216: 4089| [45] ["Now then, I have a routine to do, so I'm going back to my room."]
217: 4097| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 4100| [45] ["Yeah, go ahead."]
219: 4156| [45] [Following Mashiro's departure, Salyu also left the living room for her own room.]
220: 4161| [45] [Leaving only Natsuhiko and Yuuri behind.]
221: 4185| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 4188| [45] ["Whew... I'm kinda worn out."]
223: 4193| [45] [Yuuri smiled uncomfortably as Natsuhiko sighed.]
224: 4219| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 4222| [45] ["Worn out, why? Is it because of Salyu...?"]
226: 4230| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 4233| [45] ["Yeah, I guess it's kinda tiring to do things with people you're uncomfortable talking with."]
228: 4259| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 4262| [45] ["... I see."]
230: 4288| [47] [Yuuri]
231: 4291| [45] ["But since you're both living under the same roof, I think it'd be good for you to get along..."]
232: 4313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 4316| [45] ["I know, but honestly, I don't think I can."]
234: 4323| [45] [As Natsuhiko said this, Yuuri--]
235: 4331| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 4334| [45] ["... Is that your answer at the present point in time, Hikorin?"]
237: 4339| [45] [Yuuri spoke with an oddly quiet tone of voice.]
238: 4347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 4350| [45] ["Huh?"]
240: 4409| [45] [When Natsuhiko looked back at Yuuri in shock, he found her staring back at him with a serious look on her face.]
241: 4419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 4422| [45] ["My answer at the present point in time...?"]
243: 4448| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 4451| [45] ["After spending all day with Salyu today, did you still think you won't be able to get along with her?"]
245: 4459| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 4462| [45] ["Well... I guess that sounds about right."]
247: 4470| [47] [Yuuri]
248: 4473| [45] ["And you don't think that'll ever change?"]
249: 4481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 4484| [45] ["Mm, well... I don't know about the future, but..."]
251: 4492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 4495| [45] ["I get the strong impression that we'll never see eye to eye, I guess..."]
253: 4518| [45] [At Natsuhiko's words, Yuuri-- gave a pitifully sad expression.]
254: 4526| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 4529| [45] ["... Can nothing change your mind?"]
256: 4537| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 4540| [45] ["Is there nothing that can make you accept Salyu...?"]
258: 4545| [45] [Her expression and tone of voice were different from the usual Yuuri.]
259: 4550| [45] [Confused, Natsuhiko asked for clarification.]
260: 4558| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 4561| [45] ["... What are you talking about, Yuuri?"]
262: 4587| [47] [Yuuri]
263: 4590| [45] ["... You don't know?"]
264: 4598| [47] [Yuuri]
265: 4601| [45] ["She's trying to protect you, Hikorin..."]
266: 4627| [47] [Yuuri]
267: 4630| [45] ["She's even fighting on your behalf right now."]
268: 4635| [45] [The moment Yuuri said that--]
269: 4688| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 4691| [45] ["!?"]
271: 4696| [45] [The sight of "September 12" warped before Natsuhiko's eyes,]
272: 4701| [45] [and changed to the sight of "September 16".]
273: 4829| [45] [Natsuhiko suddenly found himself seeing Salyu in a different light.]
274: 4834| [45] [And at the same time, he felt slightly embarrassed.]
275: 4839| [45] [Now that he thought about it, not once since Salyu arrived did Natsuhiko treat her favorably.]
276: 4844| [45] [He just rejected her under the pretense that she was a girl he didn't really understand.%NWhich was by no means a good attitude to take.]
277: 4849| [47] [Natsuhiko]
278: 4850| [45] [(What am I, a kid...?)]
279: 4867| [45] [After chiding himself and pondering for a moment-- he timidly called out to Salyu.]
280: 4875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 4878| [45] ["Say, Salyu..."]
282: 4919| [47] [Salyu]
283: 4922| [45] ["What is it?"]
284: 4930| [47] [Natsuhiko]
285: 4933| [45] ["Umm, well... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for always acting so hostile towards you."]
286: 4974| [47] [Salyu]
287: 4977| [45] ["Oh, that."]
288: 5003| [47] [Salyu]
289: 5006| [45] ["It's okay. I don't mind at all. So there's no need for you to be concerned."]
290: 5014| [47] [Natsuhiko]
291: 5017| [45] ["No, but still... it was really mean of me. I'm sorry."]
292: 5043| [47] [Salyu]
293: 5046| [45] ["... Mm."]
294: 5069| [45] [It was still an awkward exchange as ever-- but it wasn't unpleasant at all.]
295: 5074| [45] [Something that had been lurking in the depths of Natsuhiko's heart had silently thawed away.]
296: 5079| [45] [And as if she had sensed that change in Natsuhiko, Mashiro smiled.]
297: 5105| [47] [Mashiro]
298: 5108| [45] ["Hmm, that's great. We've cleared up all those misunderstandings. So now we can begin our friendship anew, right?"]
299: 5116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 5119| [45] ["Hey... don't say stuff like that. You ruined the mood."]
301: 5145| [47] [Mashiro]
302: 5148| [45] ["But still, I'm impressed, Natsuhiko. You actually apologized."]
303: 5174| [47] [Mashiro]
304: 5177| [45] ["You know, you have to say those things out loud or nobody will ever know, right?"]
305: 5203| [47] [Salyu]
306: 5206| [45] ["... True. It helps if you say what's on your mind. There are some things that ARMS can't cover for, after all."]
307: 5214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 5217| [45] ["O-okay. I'll keep that in mind as we go forward."]
309: 5240| [45] [He ended up phrasing that awkwardly due to his embarrassment.]
310: 5245| [45] [Mashiro smiled devilishly and then addressed Salyu.]
311: 5271| [47] [Mashiro]
312: 5274| [45] ["By the way, Salyu? What's this doll's name?"]
313: 5300| [47] [Salyu]
314: 5303| [45] ["Huh? Like I said, it's ARMS."]
315: 5329| [47] [Mashiro]
316: 5332| [45] ["No, no, that's not what I meant... I mean, what's yours named specifically?"]
317: 5358| [47] [Mashiro]
318: 5361| [45] ["I mean, you're supposed to give pets names, right? Like Fluffy or Spot. Something like that."]
319: 5387| [47] [Salyu]
320: 5390| [45] ["!?"]
321: 5416| [47] [Salyu]
322: 5419| [45] ["I never thought about that..."]
323: 5445| [47] [Mashiro]
324: 5448| [45] ["Then why don't you name it? It's more endearing to give it a name."]
325: 5474| [47] [Salyu]
326: 5477| [45] ["True, that does sound good. But... I can't think of a name."]
327: 5503| [47] [Salyu]
328: 5506| [45] ["So I'll let you name it, Mashiro."]
329: 5532| [47] [Mashiro]
330: 5535| [45] ["Huh!? M-me!?"]
331: 5543| [47] [Mashiro]
332: 5546| [45] ["Are you sure? That's such an important responsibility, though."]
333: 5572| [47] [Salyu]
334: 5575| [45] ["But you were so quick to decide my nickname."]
335: 5583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
336: 5586| [45] ["Now that's true. Besides, you're good at that sort of thing, aren't you Mashiro?"]
337: 5612| [47] [Mashiro]
338: 5615| [45] ["Y-you're right. Okay, I'll think of a name!"]
339: 5656| [47] [Mashiro]
340: 5659| [45] ["Hmm... let's see... let's see..."]
341: 5685| [47] [Mashiro]
342: 5688| [45] ["... I know, how about 'Alice'?"]
343: 5714| [47] [Salyu]
344: 5717| [45] ["Alice?"]
345: 5725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 5728| [45] ["As in Wonderland?"]
347: 5754| [47] [Mashiro]
348: 5757| [45] ["No, not that Alice. The Alice that wrote the sci-fi novel Salyu was reading yesterday."]
349: 5765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 5768| [45] ["Yesterday? Oh, that one she had at school."]
351: 5773| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Mashiro did appear to have known about the book Salyu was reading yesterday.]
352: 5799| [47] [Salyu]
353: 5802| [45] ["But Mashiro, that's wrong. That book was written by James--"]
354: 5828| [47] [Mashiro]
355: 5831| [45] ["Heheheh, sorry, that's wrong. That was a pen name. The author's real name was Alice."]
356: 5857| [47] [Salyu]
357: 5860| [45] ["... I didn't know that. You're so knowledgeable, Mashiro."]
358: 5886| [47] [Mashiro]
359: 5889| [45] ["So, what do you think? It is a sci-fi kinda item, and it sounds cute, doesn't it?"]
360: 5965| [47] [Salyu]
361: 5968| [45] ["Yeah. I'll use it."]
362: 6006| [45] [As Salyu spoke, she gently stroked her ARMS device, now known as Alice, on the head.]
363: 6014| [47] [Natsuhiko]
364: 6017| [45] ["I think it's good too. It sounds cute. Good job, Mashiro."]
365: 6043| [47] [Mashiro]
366: 6046| [45] ["Don't praise me just for thinking of a name like that~ You're embarrassing me."]
367: 6051| [45] [Before Natsuhiko had noticed, the somewhat serious mood had been completely cleared away.]
368: 6066| [47] [Natsuhiko]
369: 6069| [45] ["But you did good. It looks like she likes it, too."]
370: 6095| [47] [Mashiro]
371: 6098| [45] ["Ah shucks, to be honest, I wasn't too sure of it~"]
372: 6124| [47] [Mashiro]
373: 6127| [45] ["I'm used to giving people nicknames, but it's been a long time since I named a pet."]
374: 6135| [47] [Natsuhiko]
375: 6138| [45] ["A pet? Did you have any pets, Mashiro?"]
376: 6146| [47] [Mashiro]
377: 6149| [45] ["We did in the past, remember? You, me, and Yuuri too."]
378: 6157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
379: 6160| [45] ["Oh... are you talking about 'Sirius'?"]
380: 6186| [47] [Mashiro]
381: 6189| [45] ["Yeah. Really brings you back, huh."]
382: 6194| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko recalled a distant memory.]
383: 6272| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 3]
384: 6385| [47] [Natsuhiko]
385: 6388| [45] ["Yeah... I almost forgot about that."]
386: 6440| [45] [Now that he thought about it, he had gotten along with Mashiro ever since that time.]
387: 6445| [45] [They didn't get along at first, but it was an animal that brought them together back then as well.]
388: 6450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
389: 6451| [45] [(It's almost like the situation now.)]
390: 6674| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Alice.]
391: 6679| [45] [This time, Alice let out a gentle squeak.]
392: 6684| [47] [Alice]
393: 6687| [45] ["Kyuu kyuu!"]
394: 6771| [47] [Mashiro]
395: 6774| [45] ["Ah, Alice squeaked again."]
396: 6782| [47] [Salyu]
397: 6785| [45] ["I've never heard that squeak before... Natsuhiko, what are you thinking now?"]
398: 6793| [47] [Natsuhiko]
399: 6796| [45] ["I was just feeling a little nostalgic."]
400: 6819| [45] [Natsuhiko answered Salyu with a smile.]
401: 6830| [47] [Natsuhiko]
402: 6833| [45] ["Now then... we've still got time. What do you want to do?"]
403: 6859| [47] [Salyu]
404: 6862| [45] ["There's nothing more I need to buy."]
405: 6867| [45] [Natsuhiko thought they should go home in that case, but Mashiro spoke up as if something had crossed her mind.]
406: 6939| [47] [Mashiro]
407: 6942| [45] ["Ah, wait, you two. Is it okay if we stop by the grocery store for just a little bit?"]
408: 6968| [47] [Natsuhiko]
409: 6971| [45] ["Huh? But I thought we already stocked the refrigerator?"]
410: 6997| [47] [Mashiro]
411: 7000| [45] ["Ah, no, I mean, yesterday we only had a plain dinner with the food we had on hand."]
412: 7026| [47] [Mashiro]
413: 7029| [45] ["So I was thinking I should be a little more extravagant tonight as a sort of welcome party for Salyu."]
414: 7063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
415: 7066| [45] ["I see... that sounds good."]
416: 7071| [45] [Now that he thought about it, they didn't have any sort of welcome party.]
417: 7076| [45] [But he was unsure if it was really appropriate to throw one now.]
418: 7102| [47] [Salyu]
419: 7105| [45] ["... So, um, can I choose what I want to eat?"]
420: 7131| [47] [Mashiro]
421: 7134| [45] ["Of course. So, what would you like, Salyu?"]
422: 7160| [47] [Salyu]
423: 7163| [45] ["Bifteck!"]
424: 7189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
425: 7192| [45] ["Pffft!"]
426: 7197| [45] [Natsuhiko was caught off guard at Salyu's vigorous response.]
427: 7205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
428: 7208| [45] ["You sure know what you want, huh. But still, calling beefsteak 'bifuteki' is such old-fashioned Japanese..."]
429: 7234| [47] [Salyu]
430: 7237| [45] ["You're so ignorant, Natsuhiko. Bifuteki comes from the French 'le bifteck'."]
431: 7263| [47] [Salyu]
432: 7266| [45] ["It means 'a cut of meat'. It's not an abbreviation of beefsteak."]
433: 7274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 7277| [45] ["What? I never knew that."]
435: 7303| [47] [Mashiro]
436: 7306| [45] ["Ahahah, anyway, you want to eat beef, right?"]
437: 7332| [47] [Salyu]
438: 7335| [45] ["Yes. So much. Hurry Mashiro, let's go now."]
439: 7384| [47] [Mashiro]
440: 7387| [45] ["Ah, hold on. Wait for me~"]
441: 7401| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu ran off.]
442: 7414| [45] [Their exchange was so peaceful, Natsuhiko couldn't help but smile.]
443: 7419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
444: 7420| [45] [(I guess this is nice...)]
445: 7425| [45] [He chased after them as he mused to himself.]
446: 7430| [45] [Natsuhiko felt just the slightest bit of euphoria in this moment.]
447: 7442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
448: 7445| [45] ["I see..."]
449: 7450| [45] [Now that he thought about it, they didn't have any sort of welcome party.]
450: 7455| [45] [Either way, he was thankful for the opportunity to have an extravagant meal.]
451: 7481| [47] [Mashiro]
452: 7484| [45] ["Okay, let's go then, Salyu."]
453: 7510| [47] [Salyu]
454: 7513| [45] ["Okay."]
455: 7571| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu headed to the shopping area.]
456: 7576| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered what would be on the menu as he followed behind them.]
