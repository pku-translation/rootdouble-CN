  0:   49| [55] [√Double Chapter 7]
  1:   60| [45] [--"I'm" with Yuuri and the others--]
  2:   65| [45] [--heading straight for Rokumei Park.]
  3:  104| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
  4:  108| [47] [[--Natsuhiko Tenkawa's Present--]]
  5:  190| [45] [For a while, we had been living a secluded life in order to escape the watchful eyes of the media.]
  6:  195| [45] [But as the chaos in the world calmed down, we took the opportunity to finally return to Rokumei City.]
  7:  200| [45] [And besides, today's the first anniversary of that girl's death.]
  8:  205| [45] [Visiting her grave is another reason we came here.]
  9:  231| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  234| [45] ["Mmm, the weather sure is nice, huh~..."]
 11:  239| [45] [Yuuri blissfully smiles as she squints her eyes.]
 12:  244| [45] [Mashiro, Salyu, and Mom respond.]
 13:  270| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  273| [45] ["It sure is peaceful here. Hard to believe what happened a year ago, isn't it~"]
 15:  299| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  302| [45] ["I agree... It's been so peaceful lately that it's a little boring, though."]
 17:  328| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  331| [45] ["You sure are tough, Yui. If you've got that much energy to spare, then I'd like you to help out with my work."]
 19:  357| [47] [Miyoko]
 20:  360| [45] ["I've spent three sleepless nights already with all this back and forth negotiation with the ESP Bureau."]
 21:  386| [47] [Miyoko]
 22:  389| [45] ["It's really tiring. I'm getting too old for this..."]
 23:  397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  400| [45] ["I'm sorry, Mom... We'll all help out together."]
 25:  426| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  429| [45] ["Of course."]
 27:  455| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  458| [45] ["I'll help out with the cooking and stuff too~"]
 29:  484| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  487| [45] ["I-I'll help out somehow too!"]
 31:  513| [47] [Miyoko]
 32:  516| [45] ["Oh my, I was just joking. You kids need to go to school."]
 33:  542| [47] [Miyoko]
 34:  545| [45] ["I'm working hard so that you kids can live like normal kids, after all."]
 35:  553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  556| [45] ["... I see."]
 37:  561| [45] [I really think she's a great mom.]
 38:  566| [45] [She's such a loving, capable, and strong person, and to be honest, I'm proud to be her son.]
 39:  571| [45] [--But I can't stay under her wing forever.]
 40:  585| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  588| [45] [{Yuuri. Mashiro. Salyu. Let's help Mom out even if she insists we don't.}]
 42:  678| [85] [{Of course!}]
 43:  679| [86] [Yuuri]
 44:  680| [86] [{Of course!}]
 45:  695| [85] [{Sure thing.}]
 46:  696| [86] [Mashiro]
 47:  697| [86] [{Sure thing.}]
 48:  746| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  749| [45] ["Mmm."]
 50:  754| [45] [We exchange those words with a smile.]
 51:  806| [45] [Eventually we reach the park.]
 52:  811| [45] [Yuuri murmurs as we walk down the road to Rokumei Cemetery.]
 53:  839| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  842| [45] ["Still, this place sure brings me back..."]
 55:  850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  853| [45] ["Yeah... it has been about 10 years since you've walked here, right, Yuuri?"]
 57:  879| [47] [Yuuri]
 58:  882| [45] ["Yes."]
 59:  908| [47] [Yuuri]
 60:  911| [45] ["Say, Hikorin, do you remember what I said when we reunited in LABO a year ago?"]
 61:  919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  922| [45] ["I do. You said you wanted us all to walk in this park again together, right?"]
 63:  948| [47] [Yuuri]
 64:  951| [45] ["Yeah... I'm so glad my wish was granted..."]
 65:  956| [45] [Mashiro and the others smile as Yuuri's eyes begin to water.]
 66:  982| [47] [Mashiro]
 67:  985| [45] ["... We can walk here as much as we want now, Yuuri."]
 68: 1011| [47] [Salyu]
 69: 1014| [45] ["Yes. I'll walk with you as much as you'd like."]
 70: 1022| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1025| [45] ["... Right."]
 72: 1030| [45] [I nod at those words too.]
 73: 1035| [45] [--The girls seem to be happy that we came back to this city.]
 74: 1189| [45] [Painful things happened here, but so too did many nostalgic memories.]
 75: 1194| [45] [It's the city that Mashiro loves, the city Salyu found where she belonged, and the city where Yuuri wanted to walk freely.]
 76: 1199| [45] [The city we lived in, and the city we've finally returned to.]
 77: 1204| [45] [We can choose our destination with our own free will. Some may take that privilege for granted--]
 78: 1209| [45] [But it truly is a blessing.]
 79: 1251| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1254| [45] ["... Say, guys."]
 81: 1280| [47] [Yuuri]
 82: 1283| [45] ["What is it?"]
 83: 1291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1294| [45] ["We're alive, aren't we?"]
 85: 1302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1305| [45] ["We took back freedom with our own hands, didn't we?"]
 87: 1332| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1335| [45] ["Mmm. It sounds moving when you say it seriously like that."]
 89: 1368| [47] [Miyoko]
 90: 1371| [45] ["... True. You all did well to come back alive..."]
 91: 1397| [47] [Mashiro]
 92: 1400| [45] ["It's thanks to the nine of us, and you too, Dr. Tenkawa."]
 93: 1405| [45] [Yes. Most of all, it's thanks to "him". Not that I'll ever say it, though. It's embarrassing.]
 94: 1410| [45] [My feelings about him still haven't changed.]
 95: 1415| [45] [He's a partner I feel grateful to, and he deserves my respect, but-- we're completely different, all the way from our heights to our ideologies. We can't even reach mutual understanding.]
 96: 1420| [45] [As that thought crosses my mind, Yuuri suddenly smiles.]
 97: 1446| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1449| [45] ["Well, no, actually..."]
 99: 1475| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1478| [45] ["It might not have been just us."]
101: 1534| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1537| [45] ["Huh?"]
103: 1542| [45] [As we look at her in confusion, Yuuri looks off into the distance.]
104: 1568| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1571| [45] ["Guys, don't you remember?"]
106: 1579| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1582| [45] ["Back then, inside LABO, about ten minutes before the bomb exploded..."]
108: 1590| [47] [Yuuri]
109: 1593| [45] ["There was that intense flashback, remember?"]
110: 1601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1604| [45] ["Yeah. There's no way I could forget that."]
112: 1630| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1633| [45] ["That was so mysterious, huh? I wonder what that was?"]
114: 1659| [47] [Salyu]
115: 1662| [45] ["In any case, it was a lifesaver. It coincidentally revealed an escape method."]
116: 1688| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1691| [45] ["Actually, that might not have been a coincidence."]
118: 1696| [45] [Mom nods at Yuuri's proposition.]
119: 1722| [47] [Miyoko]
120: 1725| [45] ["I've heard about the matter from Yuuri."]
121: 1733| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 1736| [45] ["She said that BC used in the past came back in a particular sequence, correct?"]
123: 1744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1747| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
125: 1773| [47] [Miyoko]
126: 1776| [45] ["Furthermore, there was meaningful information in that sequence, meaning..."]
127: 1784| [47] [Miyoko]
128: 1787| [45] ["... Some sort of 'consciousness' was possibly born within LABO at that time."]
129: 1813| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 1816| [45] ["A consciousness?"]
131: 1842| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1845| [45] ["Actually, Yuuri and I were trying to perform that sort of experiment that day."]
133: 1853| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1856| [45] ["An experiment to see if the stagnation and accumulation of information energy emitted with BC could create a consciousness."]
135: 1882| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1885| [45] ["In other words, an experiment to create a spirit."]
137: 1911| [47] [Salyu]
138: 1914| [45] ["A spirit..."]
139: 1922| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1925| [45] ["Do you think one was made, Mom?"]
141: 1951| [47] [Miyoko]
142: 1954| [45] ["Well, it's hard to tell at this point. We can't verify it either."]
143: 1962| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1965| [45] ["Good point..."]
145: 1991| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 1994| [45] ["But you know, Hikorin, I think--"]
147: 2003| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2006| [45] ["I felt there really was something within LABO back then."]
149: 2032| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 2035| [45] ["I think it had been drifting in LABO ever since the WX particle amplifier was activated at 6 AM."]
151: 2043| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2046| [45] ["I think that at first, it was just an empty spirit without a will of its own, unable to do anything but observe the events happening there."]
153: 2054| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2057| [45] ["But as it received our BC little by little, it took in the information stored within."]
155: 2065| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 2068| [45] ["And after it was full to the brim with information energy--"]
157: 2094| [47] [Yuuri]
158: 2097| [45] ["Mr. Spirit was finally born with a will of its own."]
159: 2123| [47] [Salyu]
160: 2126| [45] ["Born? And then what?"]
161: 2152| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 2155| [45] ["You see, I get the feeling Mr. Spirit was the one who helped us out in the end."]
163: 2163| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 2166| [45] ["Mr. Spirit found an escape route and tried to convey it to us..."]
165: 2192| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 2195| [45] ["So you mean that's what the flashback was?"]
167: 2221| [47] [Yuuri]
168: 2224| [45] ["Yes. I mean, Mr. Spirit doesn't have a way to convey its will to us on its own, does it?"]
169: 2250| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 2253| [45] ["So instead, it pieced together all the important information it had to point out the escape route for us, I guess~..."]
171: 2279| [47] [Mashiro]
172: 2282| [45] ["Yuuri, you're such a romanticist. Not that I have a problem with that or anything."]
173: 2308| [47] [Salyu]
174: 2311| [45] ["I still think it was just a coincidence."]
175: 2337| [47] [Miyoko]
176: 2340| [45] ["I can't comment on it either way. Not until we run a reproducible experiment, that is."]
177: 2366| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 2369| [45] ["Aww~"]
179: 2374| [45] [Yuuri sulks at how none of them agree with her.]
180: 2379| [45] [She looks at me as if to ask me to back her up.]
181: 2405| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 2408| [45] ["... Hey, Hikorin, what do you think?"]
183: 2416| [47] [Yuuri]
184: 2419| [45] ["Don't you feel like someone helped us out back then?"]
185: 2424| [45] [I answer the question with a smile.]
186: 2432| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 2435| [45] ["Yeah. Of course I do."]
188: 2461| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2464| [45] ["Really?"]
190: 2490| [47] [Mashiro]
191: 2493| [45] ["Good grief. Natsuhiko, you always agree with Yuuri."]
192: 2519| [47] [Salyu]
193: 2522| [45] ["Good grief."]
194: 2548| [47] [Miyoko]
195: 2551| [45] ["Good grief indeed."]
196: 2559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 2562| [45] ["No, no, no, I've always been thinking that."]
198: 2570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 2573| [45] ["It really did feel like someone helped us out back then."]
200: 2599| [47] [Mashiro]
201: 2602| [45] ["Is that so? Well, let's just leave it at that, I guess."]
202: 2670| [45] [Everyone smiles once Mashiro says that.]
203: 2677| [45] [I smile too as I secretly think to myself.]
204: 2682| [45] [--I do agree with Yuuri's opinion for the most part, but there's actually one part I disagree with:]
205: 2842| [45] [Was it really just that last flashback where we were helped out?]
206: 2847| [45] [Weren't we helped out way before that...?]
207: 2899| [45] [When I think about it, whenever I had to make an important judgment call whether to trust someone or to doubt them...]
208: 2904| [45] [It felt like some kind of vague "feeling" was pushing me from behind.]
209: 2980| [45] [Well, if I talked about it out loud, I don't think anyone would understand, so I'll just keep it to myself for now.]
210: 3006| [47] [Yuuri]
211: 3009| [45] ["... But still, guys."]
212: 3017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 3020| [45] ["Hmm?"]
214: 3046| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 3049| [45] ["If Mr. Spirit really was born..."]
216: 3057| [47] [Yuuri]
217: 3060| [45] ["Then where do you think it went?"]
218: 3087| [47] [Mashiro]
219: 3090| [45] ["Hmm, well, assuming it did get born... LABO did get blown up back then..."]
220: 3118| [47] [Salyu]
221: 3121| [45] ["So would it have disappeared in the explosion?"]
222: 3159| [47] [Miyoko]
223: 3162| [45] ["Well, the BC particle energy did decay."]
224: 3170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 3173| [45] ["No, maybe--"]
226: 3181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 3184| [45] ["Maybe once the insulators were destroyed, it left LABO and now it's drifting about somewhere."]
228: 3247| [45] [I look up at the sky as I say that.]
229: 3322| [45] [--Prof. Tsubakiyama once said in a lecture...]
230: 3327| [45] [That all bodies of energy mix upon contact.]
231: 3332| [45] [So even if the BC particle energy did decay, that doesn't mean it disappeared completely.]
232: 3380| [45] [So perhaps it was released from LABO's dark facility and spread to all corners of the world.]
233: 3385| [45] [Though if that were the case, then I guess the spirit's consciousness would start fading too.]
234: 3436| [45] [It'll probably never try to speak to us again.]
235: 3441| [45] [After all, for its nine hours of existence, it used quite unreliable communication.]
236: 3485| [45] [... But it still left us with something precious.]
237: 3490| [45] [What that newborn spirit conveyed to us--]
238: 3495| [45] [--was a "will" that desired to connect people together.]
239: 3500| [45] [The wish to share minds and walk side by side.]
240: 3556| [45] [--Even if my communication with you has stopped, my "will" shall never fade.]
241: 3561| [45] [It will remain in the minds of those I came in contact with.]
242: 3566| [45] [My wish will never be lost--]
243: 3571| [45] [It will stay with you, forever.]
244: 3734| [85] [-- "Xtend Episode" unlocked.]
245: 3736| [85] [Selectable modes have been added to the EXTRA menu.]
246: 3757| [85] [You unlocked Answer Mode for √D.]
