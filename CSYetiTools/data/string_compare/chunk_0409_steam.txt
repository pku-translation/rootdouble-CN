  1:   61| [47] [Yuuri]
  2:   62| [45] ["..."]
  3:   70| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:   73| [45] ["... Mmm..."]
  5:  128| [45] [As I wake up today--]
  6:  133| [45] [I find myself in my bed in the Tenkawa household.]
  7:  138| [45] [Of course I do. After all, ever since that incident, I've always gone to sleep and woken up in this room.]
  8:  143| [45] [I sit up and stretch wide.]
  9:  151| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  154| [45] ["Hwaaahh~aah..."]
 11:  159| [45] [I get the feeling I had a very sad dream-- but I can't seem to remember what it was.]
 12:  164| [45] [But somehow I know...]
 13:  169| [45] [... that I've often had this dream after we escaped from LABO that day.]
 14:  235| [45] [I get off my bed, change my clothes, and leave my room.]
 15:  308| [45] [Once I get into the living room, I hear cheerful greetings.]
 16:  336| [47] [Miyoko]
 17:  339| [45] ["Oh, Yuuri. Good morning."]
 18:  365| [47] [Salyu]
 19:  368| [45] ["Good morning."]
 20:  394| [47] [Mashiro]
 21:  397| [45] ["Ah, you're awake. Breakfast is ready~"]
 22:  405| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  408| [45] ["Professor. Salyu. Mashiron. Good morning."]
 24:  413| [45] [I answer everyone's morning greetings.]
 25:  421| [47] [Yuuri]
 26:  424| [45] ["And..."]
 27:  432| [47] [Yuuri]
 28:  435| [45] ["Good morning, Hikorin."]
 29:  490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  493| [45] ["Good morning, Yuuri."]
 31:  498| [45] [Mashiron, Salyu, Dr. Tenkawa, and Hikorin.]
 32:  503| [45] [Everyone's here this calm morning.]
 33:  508| [45] [Everything I've ever wanted is right here.]
 34:  516| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  519| [45] ["Now, now, sit down Yuuri. I'll serve you."]
 36:  527| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  530| [45] ["Okay, thank you."]
 38:  620| [45] [I sit down at Mashiron's prompting.]
 39:  626| [45] [The newscaster on TV was rambling on in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.]
 40:  631| [47] [Newscaster]
 41:  634| [45] ["--Next on the news."]
 42:  639| [47] [Newscaster]
 43:  642| [45] ["A new statement has been made by 'Q', an organization seen as an extremist group for years."]
 44:  647| [47] [Newscaster]
 45:  650| [45] ["This statement has shocked the world with its included Communicator testimony."]
 46:  655| [47] [Newscaster]
 47:  658| [45] ["The government has recognized the severity of the situation and is assembling a special task force to--"]
 48:  694| [47] [Miyoko]
 49:  695| [45] ["..."]
 50:  700| [45] [But Dr. Tenkawa turns the TV off before the news can finish.]
 51:  708| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  711| [45] ["Huh, what's wrong?"]
 53:  747| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  750| [45] ["It's nothing. I just don't like leaving the TV on during meals."]
 55:  776| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  779| [45] ["Now, now, it's time for breakfast. You're all hungry, aren't you?"]
 57:  805| [47] [Salyu]
 58:  808| [45] ["Mmm."]
 59:  825| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  828| [45] ["True."]
 61:  833| [45] [Listening to Salyu and Hikorin makes me smile.]
 62:  841| [47] [Yuuri]
 63:  844| [45] ["... Still, I'm glad."]
 64:  876| [47] [Mashiro]
 65:  879| [45] ["Hmm? What for?"]
 66:  887| [47] [Yuuri]
 67:  890| [45] ["I'm glad we all can share a meal around the table."]
 68:  898| [47] [Yuuri]
 69:  901| [45] ["I'm glad I get to live with everyone in peaceful days after getting out of LABO..."]
 70:  909| [47] [Yuuri]
 71:  912| [45] ["It just makes me super duper happy."]
 72:  938| [47] [Salyu]
 73:  941| [45] ["Yuuri, you're happy?"]
 74:  949| [47] [Yuuri]
 75:  952| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 76:  975| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  976| [45] ["..."]
 78:  999| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1000| [45] ["..."]
 80: 1023| [47] [Mashiro]
 81: 1024| [45] ["..."]
 82: 1029| [45] [When I say that, the professor, Yuuri, and Salyu all look sad for some reason.]
 83: 1043| [45] [Hikorin alone looks at me with a smile on his face--]
 84: 1239| [45] [--After breakfast has finished and all the dishes have been put away, Mashiron calls out to me.]
 85: 1265| [47] [Mashiro]
 86: 1268| [45] ["Hey, Yuuri. Care to take a little walk with me?"]
 87: 1276| [47] [Yuuri]
 88: 1279| [45] ["Huh? What's this all of a sudden?"]
 89: 1287| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1290| [45] ["There's something we want you to see."]
 91: 1298| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1301| [45] ["Hmm~?"]
 93: 1336| [47] [Salyu]
 94: 1339| [45] ["... If you're going on a walk, I'll come too."]
 95: 1344| [45] [Salyu joins in on Mashiron's suggestion.]
 96: 1352| [47] [Yuuri]
 97: 1355| [45] ["In that case, why don't we all go together--"]
 98: 1382| [47] [Mashiro]
 99: 1385| [45] ["No, no. Just the three of us."]
100: 1390| [45] [Mashiron's voice sounds a little tense... so I end up answering without thinking.]
101: 1398| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1401| [45] ["O-okay. Fine by me."]
103: 1412| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1415| [45] ["... Okay. Bye Hikorin. Bye Professor. We're going on a walk."]
105: 1493| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 1496| [45] ["... Yes."]
107: 1551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1554| [45] ["Okay. Have fun."]
109: 1692| [45] [--Once we leave the house, Mashiron speaks up cheerfully.]
110: 1718| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1721| [45] ["Okay, let's go."]
112: 1747| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1750| [45] ["Yes."]
114: 1758| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1761| [45] ["Where are we going?"]
116: 1787| [47] [Mashiro]
117: 1790| [45] ["Just follow me for now."]
118: 1798| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1801| [45] ["So is where we're going a secret?"]
120: 1827| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1830| [45] ["... Right. Well, it -is- a secret place, I guess."]
122: 1853| [47] [Salyu]
123: 1854| [45] ["..."]
124: 1958| [45] [And with that, Mashiron begins walking.]
125: 1963| [45] [She's acting a little strange, isn't she...]
126: 1968| [45] [I suddenly get that impression.]
127: 1995| [45] [My heart pounds a little.]
128: 2043| [45] [After Mashiron leads us for a while--]
129: 2095| [45] [We eventually come across a familiar building.]
130: 2103| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 2106| [45] ["This is..."]
132: 2114| [47] [Mashiro]
133: 2117| [45] ["Yes. It's our secret base."]
134: 2125| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 2128| [45] ["It's been a while, hasn't it? How many years now?"]
136: 2136| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 2139| [45] ["I brought you here today because there's something I want to talk about."]
138: 2147| [47] [Mashiro]
139: 2150| [45] ["Well, let's just go in for now."]
140: 2158| [47] [Yuuri]
141: 2161| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
142: 2224| [45] [The three of us enter the secret base.]
143: 2229| [45] [It looks just like how I've remembered it these nine years.]
144: 2234| [45] [As I bask in nostalgia, Mashiron starts to mutter quietly.]
145: 2264| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 2267| [45] ["... Say, Yuuri. What do you think the 'truth' is?"]
147: 2275| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2278| [45] ["Huh?"]
149: 2283| [45] [The abrupt question leaves me confused.]
150: 2337| [47] [Mashiro]
151: 2340| [45] ["Perhaps the truth isn't something you need to know. Perhaps you'd be happier living in a lie."]
152: 2348| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 2351| [45] ["But you know... I still think you really should know the truth, Yuuri."]
154: 2359| [47] [Mashiro]
155: 2362| [45] ["You're a lot stronger than I am, after all..."]
156: 2370| [47] [Mashiro]
157: 2373| [45] ["You probably have the strength to accept the truth..."]
158: 2383| [47] [Salyu]
159: 2384| [45] ["..."]
160: 2389| [45] [Mashiron speaks in a cautionary tone.]
161: 2394| [45] [Salyu looks at me expectantly.]
162: 2440| [45] [It causes my heart to sway.]
163: 2445| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 2446| [45] [(Don't tell me...)]
165: 2451| [45] [At that moment, a certain premonition runs through my head.]
166: 2549| [45] [Everyone's sad faces at breakfast. The sad dream I have every night.]
167: 2599| [45] [How Mashiron had stressed the word "truth" just now.]
168: 2604| [45] [--All the pieces hint to a certain answer.]
169: 2659| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 2660| [45] [(No way...!?)]
171: 2665| [45] [I can't believe it.]
172: 2670| [45] [No, I don't want to believe it, but--]
173: 2706| [45] [... To be honest, I may have already realized the truth.]
174: 2711| [45] [Perhaps I've only been feigning ignorance.]
175: 2716| [45] [As I ponder that point, Mashiron speaks.]
176: 2724| [47] [Mashiro]
177: 2727| [45] ["Say, Yuuri... Let me ask you for just one thing."]
178: 2735| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 2738| [45] ["No matter what it is we're about to talk about..."]
180: 2746| [47] [Mashiro]
181: 2749| [45] ["Don't run away. Let's face the truth together."]
182: 2754| [45] [Mashiron and Salyu both look me straight in the eye.]
183: 2759| [45] [I look back into their eyes and answer.]
184: 2767| [47] [Yuuri]
185: 2770| [45] ["I won't run away, Mashiron."]
186: 2778| [47] [Yuuri]
187: 2781| [45] ["I won't run. Ever."]
188: 2833| [85] [　%N　%N]
189: 2838| [45] [--I finally understand-- None of this is over yet.]
190: 2842| [85] [　]
191: 2847| [45] [So this time, we're the ones who have to save him.]
192: 2851| [85] [　]
193: 2856| [45] [Until he is truly free...]
194: 2860| [85] [　]
195: 2865| [45] [No matter how many times it takes.]
