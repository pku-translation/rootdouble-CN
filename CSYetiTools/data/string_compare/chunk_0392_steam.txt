  0:   60| [45] [--Even when Natsuhiko was faced with the final choice--]
  1:   65| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   66| [45] [(No... How the hell do you expect me to choose!?)]
  3:   71| [45] [He still had that thought.]
  4:   76| [45] [Following Watase's suggestion would just be a repeat of the same mistakes--!]
  5:  149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  152| [45] ["... Watase. I don't want to erase you."]
  7:  160| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  163| [45] ["No matter how much you want me to...!"]
  9:  198| [47] [Watase]
 10:  201| [45] ["What...?"]
 11:  258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  261| [45] ["... I've survived by erasing Nagisa time and time again."]
 13:  269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  272| [45] ["Even if I had no other choice, I've had enough."]
 15:  280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  283| [45] ["If I erase your memory, the current you will be annihilated."]
 17:  291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  294| [45] ["Even if you survive... One day your memory will come back, and I'll have to erase it again..."]
 19:  302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  305| [45] ["Wouldn't we just be repeating our same mistakes? I seriously don't want any more of it."]
 21:  313| [47] [Watase]
 22:  316| [45] ["..."]
 23:  371| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  374| [45] ["That said, I can't hand over Yuuri either. I can't go with you in her stead, either."]
 25:  382| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  385| [45] ["Remember what I said? I won't tolerate... anyone becoming a sacrifice for any reason."]
 27:  427| [47] [Watase]
 28:  430| [45] ["... I know that."]
 29:  438| [47] [Watase]
 30:  441| [45] ["But this choice isn't like that last one. Regardless of what you choose, it's not like anyone's going to die."]
 31:  449| [47] [Watase]
 32:  452| [45] ["So you should be able to make a choice. And I'm sure there's only one route that you need to choose... Correct?"]
 33:  487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  490| [45] ["... But..."]
 35:  522| [45] [Watase smiled wryly at Natsuhiko's muttering.]
 36:  530| [47] [Watase]
 37:  533| [45] ["Natsuhiko... Don't disappoint me."]
 38:  541| [47] [Watase]
 39:  544| [45] ["How can you protect what's precious to you if you can't harden your heart?"]
 40:  549| [45] [--Natsuhiko's and Watase's beliefs contradicted each other. Neither could sway the other's conviction.]
 41:  554| [45] [There could not have been a way for both of their ideals to be upheld simultaneously.]
 42:  559| [45] [But even in the face of that impasse, Natsuhiko did not lose determination.]
 43:  564| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  565| [45] [(I can't erase Watase's memory... nor can I sacrifice myself.)]
 45:  570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  571| [45] [(But I'll still search for a route we can both walk down upon...!)]
 47:  576| [45] [As Natsuhiko grasped at straws to find that route, Watase spoke up.]
 48:  586| [47] [Watase]
 49:  589| [45] ["... Is there nothing that can bring you to a decision?"]
 50:  600| [45] [Watase pulled back the gun's hammer. As if to press Natsuhiko to an answer.]
 51:  605| [45] [But Natsuhiko held back his fear and thought to himself. Could he do nothing to persuade Watase?]
 52:  613| [47] [Watase]
 53:  616| [45] ["... The helicopter will probably get here soon. There's no time for hesitation."]
 54:  624| [47] [Watase]
 55:  627| [45] ["Obviously, I don't want to do this... but I can still take Yuuri away by force if I have to."]
 56:  632| [45] [Watase placed his finger on the trigger.]
 57:  637| [45] [Natsuhiko held back his fear and thought desperately.]
 58:  642| [45] [He used all of his knowledge at hand to desperately think, think, and think, and think again, when finally--]
 59:  691| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  692| [45] [(Ah...!)]
 61:  697| [45] [He finally realized something.]
 62:  702| [45] [Within all the fragments of memories he had seen so far--]
 63:  707| [45] [Was a "truth" that could pierce Watase's mind!]
 64:  745| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  746| [45] [(I-is that it...!? Could that convince Watase too...!?)]
 66:  751| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  752| [45] [(But should I tell him out loud!?)]
 68:  758| [45] [No, that probably wouldn't cut it!]
 69:  763| [45] [It was not something that could be conveyed verbally.]
 70:  768| [45] [Facts alone were not enough. Neither were emotions.]
 71:  773| [45] [But put both facts and emotions together and--]
 72:  778| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  779| [45] [(... I can do that...!)]
 74:  833| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled the phenomenon that had occurred earlier.]
 75:  838| [45] [When the nine survivors were searching for a way to escape together, fragmentary visions flickered before their eyes.]
 76:  843| [45] [Within those fragmentary visions, they found "meaningful information".]
 77:  848| [45] [And thus, everyone's minds united.]
 78:  887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79:  888| [45] [(I can invoke that phenomenon once more!)]
 80:  893| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81:  894| [45] [(With my ability--!)]
 82:  899| [45] [--There was no time more opportune to use his ability than now.]
 83:  904| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko raised his voice.]
 84:  955| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85:  958| [45] ["Watase... You're wrong."]
 86:  993| [47] [Watase]
 87:  996| [45] ["... What?"]
 88: 1031| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1034| [45] ["It's not my choice. It's yours."]
 90: 1042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1045| [45] ["Now that you know the truth, it's up to you to remake your decision. Your choice on how to live your life from now on."]
 92: 1080| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1083| [45] ["What...? What are you saying?"]
 94: 1118| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1121| [45] ["You don't know...?"]
 96: 1129| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1132| [45] ["No, with nothing but the memories you've seen, of course you wouldn't know."]
 98: 1140| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1143| [45] ["By themselves, our memories as individuals are imperfect, no more than fragments of information."]
100: 1148| [45] [Natsuhiko focused on Watase as he spoke.]
101: 1153| [45] [With the light of conviction burning in his eyes.]
102: 1161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1164| [45] ["... I've been thinking. Why was I given such an incredible power unfitting of my stature?"]
104: 1172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1175| [45] ["I'd be better off without this power... That's what I've always thought."]
106: 1183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1186| [45] ["But now, I finally understand. BC doesn't exist to erase or warp memories at all."]
108: 1194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1197| [45] ["It exists to connect people's minds."]
110: 1232| [47] [Watase]
111: 1235| [45] ["Natsuhiko, what are you...!?"]
112: 1240| [45] [Natsuhiko's words confused Watase.]
113: 1245| [45] [Just then--]
114: 1268| [45] [Suddenly, they heard the ticking of a watch's second hand.]
115: 1304| [47] [Watase]
116: 1307| [45] ["!?"]
117: 1312| [45] [Watase gasped and looked at his left arm.]
118: 1364| [45] [Before he knew it, his digital watch disappeared and turned into an -analog watch-.]
119: 1369| [45] [The watch's time and date--]
120: 1411| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N]
121: 1415| [47] ["9/16"]
122: 1423| [47] ["11:45 PM"]
123: 1511| [47] [Watase]
124: 1514| [45] ["Wha...!? Why...!?"]
125: 1548| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1551| [45] ["... It all began in 2014."]
127: 1559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1562| [45] ["And for 16 years, the truth had been concealed."]
129: 1570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1573| [45] ["But by weaving the memories of all nine of us together, that truth comes into plain view...!"]
131: 1643| [45] [Indeed--]
132: 1648| [45] [Natsuhiko took the phenomenon he had witnessed earlier and made it his own:]
133: 1653| [45] [That is, the phenomenon of memory playback.]
134: 1658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 1659| [45] [(But I'm not just playing back Watase's memories!)]
136: 1664| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1665| [45] [(I'm playing back the memories of several people!)]
138: 1670| [45] [He had taken countless fragmentary memories and compiled them together like a film to create something with meaning.]
139: 1675| [45] [He brought together the truth as-is, without any memory manipulation, all in a wager to try and change Watase's mind--!]
140: 1781| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1784| [45] ["Behold, Watase! This is the -truth-!!"]
142: 1791| [45] [And that moment--]
143: 1935| [47] [Watase]
144: 1938| [45] ["!!"]
145: 1943| [45] [Their surroundings suddenly burned up in flames.]
146: 1948| [45] [And the landscape of Lake Rokumei changed into the sight of Rokumei City Hospital--...!]
147: 1968| [45] [--And time reversed to that night.]
148: 2127| [47] [Watase]
149: 2130| [45] ["Wa... Wataru..."]
150: 2138| [47] [Watase]
151: 2141| [45] ["Leave me and save yourself...!"]
152: 2149| [47] [Wataru]
153: 2152| [45] ["What are you saying...? There's no way in hell I can I do that..."]
154: 2228| [45] [--That night--]
155: 2233| [45] [Watase Kasasagi ran away from the flames with his twin sister, Wataru.]
156: 2241| [47] [Wataru]
157: 2244| [45] ["Didn't I tell you that if you were in grave danger, I'd save you even if it cost me my life...?"]
158: 2252| [47] [Watase]
159: 2255| [45] ["But we'll -both- die at this rate...!"]
160: 2263| [47] [Watase]
161: 2266| [45] ["You might still have a chance to get out of here by yourself...!"]
162: 2314| [47] [Wataru]
163: 2317| [45] ["Watase! You can't give up!"]
164: 2325| [47] [Wataru]
165: 2328| [45] ["You have to keep fighting on and on until the bitter end..."]
166: 2336| [47] [Wataru]

169: 2382| [47] [--"The Great Rokumei City Arson"--]
170: 2390| [47] [That was what the events of that night would come to be called.]
171: 2397| [47] [Watase inherited his sister's dying wish, setting his sights on joining the rescue squad.]
172: 2406| [47] [Everything set into motion that night.]
173: 2414| [47] [For that night was the curtain raiser]
174: 2419| [47] [of this city's secret story sixteen years in the making.]
175: 2552| [45] [--Elsewhere that same night--]
176: 2557| [45] [A government official passed away.]
177: 2601| [45] [His daughter, Ena Tsubakiyama, stared at her late father's workplace and muttered to herself.]
178: 2609| [47] [Ena]
179: 2612| [45] ["Daddy... I'll keep my promise."]
180: 2620| [47] [Ena]
181: 2623| [45] ["So please watch over me in Heaven until then, okay?"]
182: 2628| [45] [She made a solemn oath.]

185: 2676| [47] [--But she was still unaware.]
186: 2684| [47] [Of the truth behind her father's death. Of what exactly he was trying to protect:]
187: 2867| [45] [A single Communicator,]
188: 2872| [45] [Alice Enflamme.]
189: 2877| [45] [A woman once called a "monster" and a "witch".]
190: 2882| [45] [She was the trigger to the Great Rokumei City Arson-- and was confined in LABO after the incident.]

192: 2924| [47] [--And while she lived in confinement, she fell in love with a certain researcher--]
193: 2932| [47] [And conceived a child.]
194: 2941| [47] [But in exchange for giving life to her daughter,]
195: 2946| [47] [Alice lost her own life after the delivery...]
196: 3021| [45] [Miyoko Tenkawa named Alice's daughter "Yui".]
197: 3026| [45] [The girl who would later come to be known as Salyu lived the first thirteen years of her life as a test subject raised in LABO.]
198: 3107| [85] [　%N　%N]
199: 3111| [47] [--That entire series of events was concealed by LABO and the Rokumei City government.]

201: 3129| [47] [Time passed, and seven years later--]
202: 3338| [45] [--Watase succeeded his late sister's dying wish and became a rescue worker.]
203: 3421| [45] [He saved two young girls from a collapsing apartment after a gas explosion.]

298: 5463| [47] [Watase became the captain of Sirius and reunited with Kazami.]
299: 5472| [47] [Jun set her sights on joining the rescue squad just as Kazami had.]
300: 5481| [47] [Yuuri, Salyu, and Nagisa continued life confined deep underground in LABO,]
301: 5486| [47] [never allowed to see each other.]
302: 5495| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N]
303: 5499| [47] [--A long time passed--]
304: 5508| [47] [And eventually, their fates began to flow.]
305: 5704| [45] [Ena joined the ESP Bureau to follow in her father's footsteps--]
306: 5796| [45] [Ukita joined Q to pursue his own justice.]
307: 5888| [45] [And Watase became Ukita's comrade to seek vengeance for Wataru...]
308: 5982| [45] [Yuuri manipulated Salyu's memory so as to allow her outside.]
309: 6076| [45] [Once Salyu was outside of LABO, Dr. Tenkawa explained Rokumei City's public order to her--]
310: 6170| [45] [Mashiro investigated Q on her own and told Natsuhiko how they had once been a citizen group.]
311: 6268| [45] [And finally, Kazami and Jun came to LABO as rescue workers, completely oblivious to anything else.]
312: 6514| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
313: 6518| [47] [--And every event, every memory that led up to this very moment...]
314: 6523| [47] [Natsuhiko had seen it all.]
315: 6532| [47] [By itself, each memory was no more than a fragment.]
316: 6541| [47] [A worthless scrap of information--]
317: 6681| [47] [Natsuhiko]
318: 6684| [45] [{But if you connect them all together...!}]
319: 6689| [45] [The multitude of memories wove into a single message.]
320: 6694| [45] [The words Natsuhiko wanted to tell Watase--!]
321: 6720| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 6723| [45] [{Listen up, Watase!}]
323: 6728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
324: 6731| [45] [{This is the other truth to the incident 16 years ago!}]
325: 6893| [47] [Sonezaki]
326: 6896| [45] ["--Q was once not a terrorist organization. We were a simple citizen group with good intentions."]
327: 6987| [47] [Kuroda]
328: 6990| [45] ["The persecution of that citizen group triggered A's N-ification to progress all the way to completion."]
329: 6995| [47] [Kuroda]
330: 6998| [45] ["And then that tragedy occurred."]
331: 7110| [47] [Mashiro]
332: 7113| [45] ["The first name Q took was the Anti-BC League."]
333: 7121| [47] [Mashiro]
334: 7124| [45] ["The Anti-BC League."]
335: 7132| [47] [Mashiro]
336: 7135| [45] ["The Anti-BC League...!"]
337: 7298| [45] [--When strung together, the words said in the past formed a single meaning.]
338: 7303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
339: 7306| [45] [{"The Anti-BC League"-- That name sound familiar?}]
340: 7330| [47] [Natsuhiko]
341: 7333| [45] [{Remember, Watase... You've seen that very group sixteen years ago!}]
342: 7338| [47] [Watase]
343: 7339| [45] [(!!)]
344: 7344| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko said that, Watase recalled his own memories.]
345: 7405| [47] [Sonezaki]
346: 7408| [45] ["We are the citizen group known as the 'Anti-BC League'!"]
347: 7469| [47] [Watase]
348: 7472| [45] ["... The hell's this?"]
349: 7480| [47] [Wataru]
350: 7483| [45] ["Oh... they must be that BC rejection citizen group that's been troubling the city recently."]
351: 7576| [47] [Watase]
352: 7577| [45] [(A-ah...!)]
353: 7582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
354: 7585| [45] [{Remember...!?}]
355: 7590| [47] [Natsuhiko]
356: 7593| [45] [{They're the citizen group you and Wataru saw in front of the PRC back then.}]
357: 7598| [47] [Natsuhiko]
358: 7601| [45] [{They're the ones that drove Communicator A to N-ification...}]
359: 7625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
360: 7628| [45] [{They're the ones who formed Q!}]
361: 7633| [45] [--That was the first truth he needed to tell Watase.]
362: 7638| [45] [The next was the truth of the incident nine years ago--]
363: 7813| [47] [Mashiro]
364: 7816| [45] ["Anti-BC League members were arrested for the Great Rokumei City Arson, but..."]
365: 7908| [47] [Sonezaki]
366: 7911| [45] ["We gathered up our scattered members a few years later and rebuilt the organization into its current form."]
367: 8002| [47] [Higa]
368: 8005| [45] ["And in the spring nine years ago, they conducted just one small-scale destructive activity."]
369: 8120| [47] [Miyoko]
370: 8123| [45] ["Communicator residences were the target of direct destructive activity."]
371: 8131| [47] [Miyoko]
372: 8134| [45] ["And the targeted homes were partially destroyed... and some people even died."]
373: 8228| [47] [Kuroda]
374: 8231| [45] ["But it would cause a huge uproar if such a huge incident happened in a government designated top secret city, when its entire point is to have high public order, wouldn't it?"]
375: 8236| [47] [Kuroda]
376: 8239| [45] ["So instead, the city government hushed those incidents and treated them as mere accidents."]
377: 8353| [47] [Miyoko]
378: 8356| [45] ["And the targeted homes were..."]
379: 8457| [47] [Kazami]
380: 8460| [45] ["... at the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex--"]
381: 8633| [45] [--Hearing those words brought back Watase's memories as well.]
382: 8754| [47] [Watase]
383: 8757| [45] [{N-no way...!? That apartment complex... was targeted by Q...?}]
384: 8825| [47] [Natsuhiko]
385: 8828| [45] [{... That's right, Watase.}]
386: 8833| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 8836| [45] [{Nine years ago, they returned to this city and conducted destructive activity.}]
388: 8841| [47] [Natsuhiko]
389: 8844| [45] [{In other words, the incident in the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex was no ordinary gas explosion...}]
390: 8869| [47] [Natsuhiko]
391: 8872| [45] [{It was a bomb attack from Q, wasn't it!?}]
392: 8877| [47] [Watase]
393: 8880| [45] [{W-wait! That's nothing but conjecture, isn't it!? Where's the proof!?}]
394: 8904| [47] [Natsuhiko]
395: 8907| [45] [{Even without proof, there's enough material to pass judgment. Inside your memory, that is.}]
396: 8912| [47] [Watase]
397: 8915| [45] [{What?}]
398: 8939| [47] [Natsuhiko]
399: 8942| [45] [{You've been doing rescue work this in this city for years and years, haven't you? Then I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.}]
400: 8947| [47] [Natsuhiko]
401: 8950| [45] [{Nine years ago in the spring, a building was partially destroyed-- and people died inside--}]
402: 8974| [47] [Natsuhiko]
403: 8977| [45] [{Was there even one other incident like that besides the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex Gas Explosion?}]
404: 8982| [47] [Watase]
405: 8985| [45] [{...!}]
406: 8990| [45] [--Nine years ago in the spring, Q carried out "destructive activity".]
407: 8995| [45] [It was an incident where "homes were partially destroyed and people died", yet "it was treated as an accident".]
408: 9000| [45] [What could that incident be referring to? ... The lack of any other matching incidents made the answer clear.]
409: 9005| [45] [After a long silent pause, Watase muttered the answer.]
410: 9010| [47] [Watase]
411: 9013| [45] [{N-no... there were no other such incidents...!}]
412: 9018| [47] [Watase]
413: 9021| [45] [{The only Spring 2021 incident in this city that met those conditions was the one where Nagisa died!}]
414: 9045| [47] [Natsuhiko]
415: 9048| [45] [{...!}]
416: 9053| [45] [That was the answer they had arrived at--]
417: 9058| [45] [The one single truth that would move Watase's heart and change his mind.]
418: 9165| [45] [------]
419: 9170| [45] [----]
420: 9175| [45] [--]
421: 9180| [45] [--And then Watase returned to reality.]
422: 9227| [47] [Watase]
423: 9230| [45] ["Ghh..."]
424: 9235| [45] [He was at a loss for words.]
425: 9240| [45] [Watase had "remembered" the memories of nine people as a single chain of events.]
426: 9245| [45] [It was a more lifelike experience compared to the telepathy he had received in the control room.]
427: 9250| [45] [It felt as if he had seen 16 years of Rokumei City's history in an instant...!]
428: 9282| [47] [Watase]
429: 9285| [45] ["Is this... is this what you wanted to tell me, Natsuhiko?"]
430: 9320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
431: 9323| [45] ["... Yeah."]
432: 9397| [47] [Watase]
433: 9400| [45] ["So the Great Arson and the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex Gas Explosion--"]
434: 9408| [47] [Watase]
435: 9411| [45] ["Were both caused by Q...!?"]
436: 9417| [45] [Natsuhiko sternly nodded.]
437: 9422| [45] [--The truth behind those incidents had been covered up by the efforts of various people.]
438: 9427| [45] [But no matter how hard they tried to hide it--]
439: 9432| [45] [The truth remained within the fragments of memories.]
440: 9466| [47] [Natsuhiko]
441: 9469| [45] ["... So tell me, Watase."]
442: 9477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
443: 9480| [45] ["Are you still going to stay with the organization that caused Wataru's death...?"]
444: 9515| [47] [Watase]
445: 9518| [45] ["...!"]
446: 9523| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth and hung his head.]
447: 9617| [45] [--Countless instances of malice existed in this city all these sixteen years.]
448: 9622| [45] [But just as many instances of justice existed in this city as well.]
449: 9627| [45] [Q was no more than a single instance, but still--]
450: 9720| [47] [Watase]
451: 9721| [45] [(... It's the organization that wrecked Kazami's, Moribe's, and Teach's lives, isn't it...!?)]
452: 9726| [45] [Watase finally understood that.]
453: 9792| [47] [Watase]
454: 9793| [45] [(... So in the end, does terrorism really beget nothing but tragedy...!?)]
455: 9798| [47] [Watase]
456: 9799| [45] [(I thought that nothing would change without sacrifices...)]
457: 9853| [47] [Watase]
458: 9854| [45] [(But then... that makes me the same as the Rokumei City government...)]
459: 9859| [47] [Watase]
460: 9860| [45] [(The same damn government that doesn't mind sacrificing others for the sake of public order, for the sake of science, for the sake of money and self-protection...!)]
461: 9865| [45] [Watase lifted his head and looked at Natsuhiko and Yuuri.]
462: 9935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
463: 9938| [45] ["... Watase. You and I are different in just about every way."]
464: 9946| [47] [Natsuhiko]
465: 9949| [45] ["I will never be you, and I will probably never understand you from the bottom of my heart."]
466: 9976| [47] [Yuuri]
467: 9979| [45] ["But even if two people can never come to mutual understanding--"]
468: 10010| [47] [Yuuri]
469: 10013| [45] ["If they compromise and search together, they're sure to find a brand new route to take."]
470: 10018| [45] [After hearing those words--]
471: 10023| [45] [Watase's convictions finally crumbled.]
472: 10031| [47] [Watase]
473: 10034| [45] ["... Yeah."]
474: 10045| [45] [Watase quietly lowered his gun.]
475: 10050| [45] [And then he wordlessly looked up to the night sky.]
476: 10193| [45] [Sparkling stars dotted the whole sky.]
477: 10198| [45] [The stars were spread out far apart, and never seemed to overlap.]
478: 10203| [45] [Much in the same way that human hearts never do.]
479: 10208| [45] [The distance between them all was hopelessly far.]
480: 10213| [45] [But regardless--]
481: 10218| [47] [Watase]
482: 10219| [45] [(... Regardless... we strive for mutual understanding...)]
483: 10224| [47] [Watase]
484: 10225| [45] [(Without ever abandoning the desire to walk side by side...!)]
485: 10230| [45] [Once he reached the epiphany of what people were meant to do--]
486: 10235| [45] [He felt the dark intentions that had been ruling him finally fade away.]
487: 10254| [45] [... Eventually, a wind-cutting sound approached from the distance.]
488: 10259| [45] [A helicopter's silhouette drew down from the night sky...]
