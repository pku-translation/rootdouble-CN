  0:   46| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 4]
  1:   61| [45] [--Area 5, outer ring, B2, neuroscience laboratory--]
  2:   66| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Jun filed into the room.]
  3:   71| [45] [Ena and Ukita were not far behind. But no one had seen Yuuri.]
  4:  178| [47] [Ena]
  5:  181| [45] ["I checked B2, but I didn't find her."]
  6:  189| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  192| [45] ["Me neither..."]
  8:  200| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  203| [45] ["... So we've really lost sight of her, huh..."]
 10:  208| [45] [The gloomy look on Kazami's face as she said that led Watase to bow his head.]
 11:  216| [47] [Watase]
 12:  219| [45] ["... I'm sorry."]
 13:  245| [47] [Jun]
 14:  248| [45] ["It's not your fault. None of us had any more luck than you did..."]
 15:  253| [45] [Ukita suddenly spoke up when he heard Jun's comment.]
 16:  325| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  328| [45] ["... It's not his fault? I wonder about that."]
 18:  336| [47] [Watase]
 19:  339| [45] ["Huh?"]
 20:  365| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  368| [45] ["This has been bothering me for a while now, but... Yuuri always acted as if she were afraid of you, did she not?"]
 22:  376| [47] [Watase]
 23:  379| [45] ["...!"]
 24:  391| [45] [That was the exact same thing that'd been bugging Watase this whole time, but--]
 25:  396| [47] [Watase]
 26:  397| [45] [(So someone else has finally pointed it out...!)]
 27:  402| [45] [But Kazami quizzically asked a question of her own.]
 28:  428| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  431| [45] ["... Um, what do you mean by that, Mr. Ukita?"]
 30:  457| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  460| [45] ["I mean what I said."]
 32:  468| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  471| [45] ["I trust you recall that Yuuri vanished once when were searching Area 3?"]
 34:  479| [47] [Watase]
 35:  482| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 36:  510| [45] [Watase found himself unconsciously raising his voice. Ukita's observation had hit too close to home.]
 37:  518| [47] [Watase]
 38:  521| [45] ["H-hey old man, what's that supposed to mean!?"]
 39:  547| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  550| [45] ["Hmph, I mean what I said."]
 41:  558| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  561| [45] ["I trust you recall that Yuuri vanished once when were searching Area 3?"]
 43:  569| [47] [Watase]
 44:  572| [45] ["What's that got to do with anything?"]
 45:  580| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  583| [45] ["I've suspected this whole time that Yuuri was in fact trying to run away from you."]
 47:  591| [47] [Watase]
 48:  594| [45] ["What!?"]
 49:  620| [47] [Ena]
 50:  623| [45] ["Mr. Ukita... what makes you think that?"]
 51:  649| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  652| [45] ["Wait, did none of you notice it?"]
 53:  678| [47] [Ukita]
 54:  681| [45] ["Yuuri would always twitch suddenly and tremble whenever Captain Kasasagi talked to her, did she not?"]
 55:  722| [47] [Kazami & Jun]
 56:  725| [45] ["...!"]
 57:  730| [45] [Kazami and Jun's faces froze over.]
 58:  756| [47] [Jun]
 59:  759| [45] ["W-well yeah... she did, but..."]
 60:  785| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  788| [45] ["It is not uncommon for survivors in disaster sites to be extremely frightened."]
 62:  796| [47] [Kazami]
 63:  799| [45] ["In fact, this is one of the worst disaster sites I've ever seen... so a reaction like that is fairly normal."]
 64:  825| [47] [Ukita]
 65:  828| [45] ["Mmm. I do not mind if that is the way you wish to interpret it."]
 66:  854| [47] [Ukita]
 67:  857| [45] ["But what about you, Captain Kasasagi? Do you yourself have any clues as to what could have caused such behavior?"]
 68:  865| [47] [Watase]
 69:  868| [45] ["N-no..."]
 70:  873| [45] [His voice lacked any strength.]
 71:  878| [45] [Watase had no basis on which to deny Ukita's suspicions.]
 72:  883| [45] [As for why-- it was because he didn't remember anything from before he'd woken up.]
 73:  888| [47] [Watase]
 74:  889| [45] [(Did I do something horrible to Yuuri...)]
 75:  894| [47] [Watase]
 76:  895| [45] [(... before I lost my memories...?)]
 77:  903| [47] [Ukita]
 78:  906| [45] ["Well, Captain Kasasagi? Are you absolutely sure that you have no possible clues to her behavior?"]
 79:  914| [47] [Ukita]
 80:  917| [45] ["In fact, why did you go to the basement in the first place? How did you lose your memories?"]
 81:  925| [47] [Watase]
 82:  928| [45] ["W-well..."]
 83:  954| [47] [Ukita]
 84:  957| [45] ["Amnesia caused by external trauma normally fades away with the progression of time.%NYet you show no signs of recovery regardless of how long it's been... do you not find that strange?"]
 85:  962| [45] [Ukita's questioning had turned into an all-out interrogation. Jun chose that moment to cut in.]
 86:  988| [47] [Jun]
 87:  991| [45] ["Mr. Ukita... are you implying something?"]
 88: 1018| [47] [Ukita]
 89: 1021| [45] ["I am. It is my belief that--"]
 90: 1047| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1050| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi may be lying about having amnesia."]
 92: 1103| [47] [All]
 93: 1106| [45] ["!!"]
 94: 1117| [45] [Everyone gasped at that declaration.]
 95: 1143| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1146| [45] ["Th-that's impossible! Why would he ever need to lie about something like that!?"]
 97: 1172| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1175| [45] ["I believe... that it's because he's trying to hide something."]
 99: 1201| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1204| [45] ["No, if I'm to be completely honest, I've suspected that from the very beginning."]
101: 1212| [47] [Watase]
102: 1215| [45] ["What?"]
103: 1241| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1244| [45] ["You took my security card from me a few hours ago. As a result, I was unable to leave Area 3."]
105: 1270| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1273| [45] ["But now that I think about it, that action by itself is considerably strange. Why would you need to steal a security card?"]
107: 1281| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1284| [45] ["Was it because you wanted to do something that you kept secret from us staff members?"]
109: 1338| [47] [Watase]
110: 1341| [45] ["What... would that 'something' even be?"]
111: 1349| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1352| [45] ["I would have no way of knowing that, of course. But I cannot help but wonder if it has something to do with the reason Yuuri was so terrified."]
113: 1378| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1381| [45] ["And there have been multiple murders on top of all that... so it is only natural to be suspicious, no?"]
115: 1389| [47] [Watase]
116: 1392| [45] ["I-I've done nothing wrong! Even without my memories, I--"]
117: 1418| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1421| [45] ["Then go ahead and prove your innocence!"]
119: 1436| [47] [Watase]
120: 1439| [45] ["Don't be ridiculous! You're asking the impossible!"]
121: 1447| [47] [Watase]
122: 1450| [45] ["How the hell is anyone supposed to prove that they have amnesia!? Isn't that right, guys!?"]
123: 1455| [45] [Watase said that and turned to Kazami and the others.]
124: 1481| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1484| [45] ["Yes, but...!"]
126: 1489| [45] [Kazami shut her mouth before she could continue.]
127: 1515| [47] [Jun]
128: 1518| [45] ["... But it really is odd that you can't remember anything..."]
129: 1523| [45] [Jun looked at Watase for a moment with a flicker of suspicion.]
130: 1536| [47] [Watase]
131: 1539| [45] ["But... but there's nothing I can...!"]
132: 1544| [45] [Watase's voice trailed off there.]
133: 1549| [47] [Watase]
134: 1550| [45] [(How the hell is anyone supposed to prove that they have amnesia..!?)]
135: 1555| [45] [He looked to Kazami and the others for help--]
136: 1560| [45] [But they just stared at him with cold eyes.]
137: 1586| [47] [Jun]
138: 1589| [45] ["... Yeah... it is odd that you can't remember anything..."]
139: 1594| [45] [Jun's eyes were full of suspicion.]
140: 1620| [47] [Kazami]
141: 1623| [45] ["... Captain, don't you have any sort of proof at all...?"]
142: 1628| [45] [Kazami said that in a pleading voice.]
143: 1651| [47] [Ena]
144: 1652| [45] ["..."]
145: 1657| [45] [Ena didn't say a thing.]
146: 1665| [47] [Watase]
147: 1668| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
148: 1673| [45] [Watase's feet started to shake when he saw their reactions.]
149: 1699| [47] [Ukita]
150: 1702| [45] ["Do you understand now, Captain Kasasagi? It isn't just Yuuri; -everyone- is scared."]
151: 1710| [47] [Watase]
152: 1713| [45] ["B-but... I really..."]
153: 1739| [47] [Ukita]
154: 1742| [45] ["What's that? Then are you saying you can explain your actions from before you lost your memories!?"]
155: 1750| [47] [Watase]
156: 1753| [45] ["U-ughh...!"]
157: 1758| [45] [Watase groaned.]
158: 1763| [45] [He was bitter that he had no comeback to that.]
159: 1768| [45] [Frustrated that he couldn't remember anything.]
160: 1773| [45] [And above all else--]
161: 1778| [45] [He desired from the bottom of his heart to know what he had indeed been doing.]
162: 1783| [47] [Watase]
163: 1784| [45] [(Dammit, what... what in the world was I doing?)]
164: 1789| [47] [Watase]
165: 1790| [45] [(What the hell was I--!?)]
166: 1795| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
167: 1845| [47] [Watase]
168: 1846| [45] [(!?)]
169: 1851| [45] [Light burst open in his head.]
170: 1882| [47] [Watase]
171: 1885| [45] ["Ghh!"]
172: 1890| [45] [Watase instinctively held his head.]
173: 1916| [47] [Ukita]
174: 1919| [45] ["... What is it?"]
175: 1945| [47] [Ena]
176: 1948| [45] ["!?"]
177: 1974| [47] [Kazami]
178: 1977| [45] ["Captain!?"]
179: 2003| [47] [Jun]
180: 2006| [45] ["What's wrong!?"]
181: 2011| [45] [The rest of the group called out to Watase, but their voices sounded distant to him.]
182: 2019| [47] [Watase]
183: 2022| [45] ["Ugh, agh..."]
184: 2030| [47] [Watase]
185: 2033| [45] ["Aaaaghh..."]
186: 2038| [45] [His sense of time simultaneously lost all normality.]
187: 2043| [45] [As if every second were as long as an eternity, and an eternity was as short as a second...!]
188: 2123| [45] [His vision grew disoriented and was dyed black.]
189: 2128| [45] [He heard a voice echo through the darkness.]
190: 2133| [47] [???]
191: 2136| [45] ["--Captain, we've discovered survivors in the basement--"]
192: 2141| [47] [???]
193: 2144| [45] ["Get down here right away!"]
194: 2149| [45] [Watase sprung off into a run when he heard those voices.]
195: 2154| [45] [There was a watch right in his line of sight. The hands pointed to "6:42".]
196: 2159| [45] [And right after his memory of seeing the time--]
197: 2164| [47] [Watase]
198: 2165| [45] [(... Huh...!?)]
199: 2170| [45] [A hazy scene emerged from the darkness.]
200: 2248| [45] [--It was of something that'd happened right in LABO.]
201: 2253| [45] [Watase was running through some connecting passageway.]
202: 2258| [47] [Watase]
203: 2259| [45] [(What the hell is this...!?)]
204: 2264| [45] [There were two men in protection suits running along with him.]
205: 2342| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
206: 2345| [45] ["Captain, over here!"]
207: 2350| [47] [Rescue Worker 1]
208: 2353| [45] ["I heard footsteps coming from this way!"]
209: 2358| [47] [Watase]
210: 2359| [45] [(Are these... "Dojima" and "Hiyama"...!?)]
211: 2364| [45] [Their voices were muffled, so he had a hard time making out what they were saying.%NHis field of vision was also foggy.]
212: 2369| [45] [It was then that Watase finally realized it.]
213: 2374| [47] [Watase]
214: 2375| [45] [(... I get it.)]
215: 2380| [47] [Watase]
216: 2381| [45] [(I'm also wearing a protection suit...!)]
217: 2428| [45] [Before long--]
218: 2436| [47] [Boy]
219: 2439| [45] ["Ah!"]
220: 2444| [45] [He heard a boy's voice through his protection suit.]
221: 2533| [45] [Watase could see a boy and some girls standing further down the hallway.]
222: 2559| [47] [Boy]
223: 2562| [45] ["--It's a rescue squad!"]
224: 2567| [45] [The boy shouted that as soon as he saw Watase and the others.]
225: 2575| [47] [Boy]
226: 2578| [45] ["They must have gotten a report and came to rescue us!"]
227: 2604| [47] [Girl]
228: 2607| [45] ["We... we're saved!"]
229: 2652| [47] [Girl]
230: 2655| [45] ["Heeey theeere, please save uuuus!"]
231: 2660| [45] [One of the girls jumped for joy and waved at Watase and the others.]
232: 2665| [45] [Next to her was one other person: a blonde haired girl.]
233: 2673| [47] [Watase]
234: 2676| [45] ["Survivors!"]
235: 2731| [45] [Watase and the others ran up to them.]
236: 2739| [47] [Watase]
237: 2742| [45] ["You kids sure as heck aren't staff members. What're you doing down here?"]
238: 2768| [47] [Boy]
239: 2771| [45] ["We happened to be down here by coincidence and got caught up in all this."]
240: 2779| [47] [Watase]
241: 2782| [45] ["Is there anyone else with you?"]
242: 2790| [47] [Boy]
243: 2793| [45] ["No, just the three of us."]
244: 2801| [47] [Watase]
245: 2804| [45] ["What're your names?"]
246: 2830| [47] [Mashiro]
247: 2833| [45] ["He's Natsuhiko and I'm Mashiro. And this one's Salyu."]
248: 2841| [47] [Watase]
249: 2844| [45] ["Salyu?"]
250: 2870| [47] [Salyu]
251: 2873| [45] ["A nickname. Comes from Louise Yui Sannomiya."]
252: 2881| [47] [Watase]
253: 2884| [45] ["I see..."]
254: 2936| [45] [Watase checked the time as he said this.]
255: 2947| [45] [The watch's hands were pointing to "6:52".]
256: 2952| [45] [--The scenery in front of him swayed and vanished at that moment--]
257: 3250| [45] [And then images flashed by one after another.]
258: 3547| [47] [Watase]
259: 3548| [45] [(This is--)]
260: 3845| [45] [They were sights Watase had seen just a few hours ago.]
261: 4142| [45] [Fragments of his lost memories.]
262: 4229| [86] [Watase]
263: 4230| [86] ["This is... there was AD in a place like this?"]
264: 4231| [86] [Watase]
265: 4232| [86] ["There was this much AD being kept inside the facility too...?"]
266: 4242| [85] ["This is... there was AD in a place like this?"]
267: 4297| [85] ["There was this much AD being kept inside the facility too...?"]
268: 4415| [47] [Yuuri]
269: 4418| [45] ["--W-who are you!?"]
270: 4426| [47] [Watase]
271: 4429| [45] ["I'm a rescue worker. I'm here to save you."]
272: 4437| [47] [Watase]
273: 4440| [45] ["Here, take this. It's medicine."]
274: 4466| [47] [Yuuri]
275: 4469| [45] ["N-no!"]
276: 4477| [47] [Watase]
277: 4480| [45] ["You can't be that way! You'll be in danger if you don't take this!"]
278: 4488| [47] [Watase]
279: 4491| [45] ["Please, don't struggle!"]
280: 4591| [47] [Watase]
281: 4594| [45] ["Khh... she got away..."]
282: 4641| [47] [Watase]
283: 4644| [45] ["Where could she have gone...?"]
284: 4691| [47] [Watase]
285: 4694| [45] ["Area N...? There's a meltdown going on just up ahead!?"]
286: 4771| [47] [Watase]
287: 4774| [45] ["... Ghh!?"]
288: 4782| [47] [Watase]
289: 4785| [45] ["M... my head...!"]
290: 4862| [47] [Watase]
291: 4865| [45] ["Ghh, ghhhhh...!"]
292: 4942| [47] [Watase]
293: 4945| [45] ["... AAAAAAAAAAGH!"]
294: 5004| [45] [--And with his scream as the finale, the images shattered and faded away.]
295: 5147| [47] [Watase]
296: 5150| [45] ["--AAAAAAAAH!"]
297: 5161| [45] [Watase screamed again as he returned to reality.]
298: 5169| [47] [Kazami]
299: 5172| [45] ["Captain! Captain, please calm down!"]
300: 5180| [47] [Watase]
301: 5183| [45] ["Huh, ah... ah!?"]
302: 5188| [45] [Kazami's voice brought him back to his senses.]
303: 5193| [45] [He realized that he was now back where he'd started; the neuroscience laboratory.]
304: 5201| [47] [Jun]
305: 5204| [45] ["Y-you okay!?"]
306: 5212| [47] [Watase]
307: 5215| [45] ["... Y-yeah... I'm okay."]
308: 5220| [45] [Watase took a deep breath, then spoke.]
309: 5228| [47] [Watase]
310: 5231| [45] ["M-more importantly... I just remembered."]
311: 5257| [47] [Kazami]
312: 5260| [45] ["... Huh?"]
313: 5286| [47] [Jun]
314: 5289| [45] ["Wait, does that mean!?"]
315: 5297| [47] [Watase]
316: 5300| [45] ["... My memory came back."]
317: 5326| [47] [Ukita]
318: 5329| [45] ["... What!?"]
319: 5334| [45] [Ukita's eyes widened.]
320: 5360| [47] [Ukita]
321: 5363| [45] ["I-impossible...! Your memories just came back all at once?"]
322: 5371| [47] [Watase]
323: 5374| [45] ["No, only a few of them, but still...!"]
324: 5400| [47] [Ukita]
325: 5403| [45] ["Hold on, what are you trying to say!?"]
326: 5411| [47] [Watase]
327: 5414| [45] ["Nothing really. But I may have remembered exactly what I need to prove my innocence."]
328: 5440| [47] [Ukita]
329: 5443| [45] ["Wha... t...?"]
330: 5448| [45] [Watase then slowly began to talk.]
331: 5456| [47] [Watase]
332: 5459| [45] ["... I'll go through everything in order..."]
333: 5467| [47] [Watase]
334: 5470| [45] ["The reason I went to the basement... was because Dojima and Hiyama called for me."]
335: 5478| [47] [Watase]
336: 5481| [45] ["Yes, I think they called me over the radio and told me... that there were survivors in the basement."]
337: 5507| [47] [Jun]
338: 5510| [45] ["When was this!?"]
339: 5518| [47] [Watase]
340: 5521| [45] ["Let me think... oh right, it was at 6:42 AM."]
341: 5547| [47] [Kazami]
342: 5550| [45] ["6:42 AM...? Are you absolutely sure about that?"]
343: 5558| [47] [Watase]
344: 5561| [45] ["Yeah."]
345: 5705| [45] [He'd checked his watch at that time.]
346: 5710| [45] [The hands were pointing to exactly 6:42. There was no mistake about that.]
347: 5715| [45] [There was something about that part that felt slightly off to him--%Nbut he decided to trust his memories.]
348: 5838| [47] [Watase]
349: 5841| [45] ["I then went to Area 2... where I found Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu."]
350: 5867| [47] [Kazami]
351: 5870| [45] ["Salyu?"]
352: 5878| [47] [Watase]
353: 5881| [45] ["It's Louise Yui Sannomiya's nickname. I think she said it came from her full name somehow."]
354: 5886| [45] [His memories of that time were gradually growing clearer and clearer.]
355: 5891| [45] [He was sure that was the name that Natsuhiko and Mashiro had called her by.]
356: 5917| [47] [Ena]
357: 5920| [45] ["It's just like he says... Mr. Tenkawa and Ms. Toba did call her by that name."]
358: 5925| [45] [Ena added that. Kazami then spoke as if she'd also remembered something.]
359: 5951| [47] [Kazami]
360: 5954| [45] ["Come to think of it, we spotted those survivors..."]
361: 5980| [47] [Jun]
362: 5983| [45] ["... in the basement of Area 2, right?"]
363: 6009| [47] [Ena]
364: 6012| [45] ["Really?"]
365: 6038| [47] [Kazami]
366: 6041| [45] ["... I can't be sure, but the times almost match up."]
367: 6049| [47] [Kazami]
368: 6052| [45] ["The Captain and the others may not have been too far from us when we were putting out those fires."]
369: 6060| [47] [Watase]
370: 6063| [45] ["Yeah, maybe you're right..."]
371: 6068| [45] [Watase nodded, then continued.]
372: 6076| [47] [Watase]
373: 6079| [45] ["Anyway, Dojima, Hiyama, and I took Natsuhiko and the others under our protection and continued rescue efforts."]
374: 6087| [47] [Watase]
375: 6090| [45] ["But I couldn't stay in the basement forever. I felt I had to get back to the surface soon."]
376: 6098| [47] [Watase]
377: 6101| [45] ["So I left Natsuhiko and the others in Dojima and Hiyama's care and was heading back for the surface by myself..."]
378: 6109| [47] [Watase]
379: 6112| [45] ["When I suddenly came across Yuuri."]
380: 6138| [47] [Ukita]
381: 6141| [45] ["What happened after that!?"]
382: 6149| [47] [Watase]
383: 6152| [45] ["I took her under my protection and tried to bring her up to the surface with me."]
384: 6160| [47] [Watase]
385: 6163| [45] ["But she started struggling when I tried to inject her with some AD... and then she ran off."]
386: 6189| [47] [Ena]
387: 6192| [45] ["Struggling? Why?"]
388: 6200| [47] [Watase]
389: 6203| [45] ["That's something I didn't know even back then..."]
390: 6208| [45] [Silence hung in the air for a moment-- but then Jun's voice broke it apart.]
391: 6234| [47] [Jun]
392: 6237| [45] ["But now that I think about it, Yuuri always was against being injected with AD."]
393: 6263| [47] [Kazami]
394: 6266| [45] ["True... it was the same regardless of whether the Captain or I tried to do it."]
395: 6274| [47] [Watase]
396: 6277| [45] ["That's right. Then when I was starting to get confused over Yuuri's rejections... she managed to break free of my grasp and run away."]
397: 6285| [47] [Watase]
398: 6288| [45] ["I went around looking for her immediately. I then ended up near Area N."]
399: 6296| [47] [Watase]
400: 6299| [45] ["But then my head just started hurting like crazy...!"]
401: 6325| [47] [Jun]
402: 6328| [45] ["A headache? Could that have been from radiation damage?"]
403: 6336| [47] [Watase]
404: 6339| [45] ["I don't know... it felt like my head had received some sort of shock..."]
405: 6347| [47] [Watase]
406: 6350| [45] ["... Maybe someone hit me."]
407: 6376| [47] [Ena]
408: 6379| [45] ["But who did it?"]
409: 6384| [47] [Watase]
410: 6385| [45] ["..."]
411: 6411| [47] [Ena]
412: 6414| [45] ["Please be clear! This is the part that really matters!"]
413: 6422| [47] [Watase]
414: 6425| [45] ["I'm sorry, I really don't know!"]
415: 6451| [47] [Ena]
416: 6454| [45] ["...!"]
417: 6477| [45] [Watase unintentionally raised his voice, putting Ena into a startled silence.]
418: 6485| [47] [Watase]
419: 6488| [45] ["... Though my memory is back, that part is extremely fragmented... I don't remember when it was or much of the details."]
420: 6496| [47] [Watase]
421: 6499| [45] ["But... I can say this and this alone with clear confidence."]
422: 6504| [45] [Watase looked square at everyone.]
423: 6512| [47] [Watase]
424: 6515| [45] ["I tried to save Yuuri."]
425: 6523| [47] [Watase]
426: 6526| [45] ["You may not believe me... but that fact's never changed, not even now."]
427: 6531| [45] [And with that, Watase's long story came to an end.]
428: 6536| [45] [It wasn't long before Ukita snorted.]
429: 6562| [47] [Ukita]
430: 6565| [45] ["... Hmph, such unreliable memories, wouldn't you agree?"]
431: 6573| [47] [Ukita]
432: 6576| [45] ["Can you prove everything you've just told us is true?"]
433: 6581| [45] [As soon as Ukita said that-- one of Watase's memories came back to mind.]
434: 6676| [86] [Watase]
435: 6677| [86] ["This is... there was AD in a place like this?"]
436: 6678| [86] [Watase]
437: 6679| [86] ["There was this much AD being kept inside the facility too...?"]
438: 6689| [85] ["This is... there was AD in a place like this?"]
439: 6706| [85] ["There was this much AD being kept inside the facility too...?"]
440: 6772| [47] [Watase]
441: 6775| [45] ["--Yeah, I can!"]
442: 6801| [47] [Ukita]
443: 6804| [45] ["What!?"]
444: 6812| [47] [Watase]
445: 6815| [45] ["I found a large stock of AD in the facility before I lost my memories."]
446: 6841| [47] [Kazami]
447: 6844| [45] ["What!? Where!?"]
448: 6852| [47] [Watase]
449: 6855| [45] ["It was..."]
450: 6860| [45] [His memory became clearer in the blink of an eye.]
451: 6865| [45] [The fragmented images linked together like pieces of a puzzle to reveal a familiar location to Watase.]
452: 6873| [47] [Watase]
453: 6876| [45] ["... Right, it was in Area 5's inner ring on B2."]
454: 6902| [47] [Jun]
455: 6905| [45] ["That's the contaminated zone you and I searched earlier!"]
456: 6913| [47] [Watase]
457: 6916| [45] ["Yeah. It was in the room where we found those five AD-- Mrs. Miyoko Tenkawa's office."]
458: 6924| [47] [Watase]
459: 6927| [45] ["We didn't see it, but there's still a shitload of AD in that room.%NIt should be in one of the desk drawers."]
460: 6932| [45] [He was nigh-certain of that.]
461: 6937| [45] [There was no way he could have remembered such a vivid memory incorrectly.]
462: 6945| [47] [Watase]
463: 6948| [45] ["If that AD's still there now... then that should prove I was telling the truth."]
464: 6974| [47] [Ukita]
465: 6977| [45] ["...!"]
466: 6982| [45] [Ukita shut up at Watase's declaration.]
467: 6987| [45] [Jun and Kazami quickly spoke up.]
468: 6995| [47] [Jun]
469: 6998| [45] ["I-I'll go check it out!"]
470: 7006| [47] [Kazami]
471: 7009| [45] ["I'm coming too!"]
472: 7037| [45] [They then rushed out of the neuroscience laboratory.]
473: 7128| [45] [--And then, just a few minutes later--]
474: 7133| [45] [--Kazami and Jun returned, their arms full of medical boxes.]
475: 7240| [47] [Jun]
476: 7243| [45] ["Captain... they really were in that room."]
477: 7269| [47] [Ukita]
478: 7272| [45] ["How much did you find?"]
479: 7299| [47] [Kazami]
480: 7302| [45] ["Try not to get surprised... but there were 30 AD amongst six medical boxes."]
481: 7328| [47] [Ena]
482: 7331| [45] ["Th-thirty!? That's incredible!!"]
483: 7336| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at that piece of news.]
484: 7341| [45] [Watase was also surprised, but found himself breaking out into a genuine smile.%NThat was much more AD than he'd been expecting.]
485: 7349| [47] [Watase]
486: 7352| [45] ["30 ampules... seriously? That's 30 hours worth of AD..."]
487: 7378| [47] [Kazami]
488: 7381| [45] ["Yes! Now we don't have to worry about running out of AD for the time being!"]
489: 7407| [47] [Jun]
490: 7410| [45] ["Yeah! And it also proves that the Captain was telling the truth!"]
491: 7436| [47] [Jun]
492: 7439| [45] ["Isn't that right, Mr. Ukita!?"]
493: 7465| [47] [Ukita]
494: 7468| [45] ["--"]
495: 7473| [45] [Ukita looked away awkwardly.]
496: 7481| [47] [Watase]
497: 7484| [45] ["... Do you believe me now, old man?"]
498: 7492| [47] [Watase]
499: 7495| [45] ["I never once intended to hurt Yuuri, to say the least of everyone else."]
500: 7500| [47] [Ukita]
501: 7501| [45] ["..."]
502: 7509| [47] [Watase]
503: 7512| [45] ["... If I really were a bad person, then I would've kept that AD hidden without telling you guys about it, right?"]
504: 7520| [47] [Watase]
505: 7523| [45] ["But instead, I was honest and let everyone know... please trust me."]
506: 7528| [45] [As soon as Watase's earnest pleas reached Ukita's ears--%Nthe latter finally started talking with a bitter tone in his voice.]
507: 7600| [47] [Ukita]
508: 7603| [45] ["I-I suppose it's just as you say..."]
509: 7608| [45] [It felt like there was still a glimmer of doubt in his eyes, but--]
510: 7651| [47] [Watase]
511: 7652| [45] [(As long as he understands, then that's all I need...)]
512: 7657| [45] [Jun then walked over to Watase.]
513: 7720| [47] [Jun]
514: 7723| [45] ["U-Um, Captain... sorry I didn't believe you right away."]
515: 7736| [45] [Watase saw guilt filling Jun's face. Thus, he made his best effort to speak to her as cheerfully as possible.]
516: 7744| [47] [Watase]
517: 7747| [45] ["Nah, don't worry, it was no big deal."]
518: 7755| [47] [Jun]
519: 7758| [45] ["But even though it was just for a sec... I still doubted that you actually had amnesia..."]
520: 7763| [45] [He may have indeed looked guilty from another's perspective.]
521: 7768| [47] [Watase]
522: 7769| [45] [(Maybe it'd be best if I avoided doing anything that makes me look suspicious to the others from now on...)]
523: 7774| [45] [Watase thought that as Kazami and the others spoke.]
524: 7817| [47] [Kazami]
525: 7820| [45] ["I believed you. You should be scolding Moribe."]
526: 7829| [45] [A fit of anger came over Watase as he saw the guilt filling Jun's face.]
527: 7837| [47] [Watase]
528: 7840| [45] ["Yeah, you'd better be. I figured you'd trust someone you'd been with for so long."]
529: 7866| [47] [Jun]
530: 7869| [45] ["Like I said... I'm sorry..."]
531: 7874| [45] [Jun shrunk back like a little kid getting scolded by her father.]
532: 7882| [47] [Watase]
533: 7885| [45] ["Ah, it's okay, you don't have to feel -that- ashamed of yourself..."]
534: 7890| [45] [Kazami and the others then cut in.]
535: 7933| [47] [Kazami]
536: 7936| [45] ["I believed him. You should reflect on your attitude a little more, Moribe."]
537: 7964| [47] [Ena]
538: 7967| [45] ["Really? I'll be honest; I thought the whole amnesia thing was bullshit from the beginning."]
539: 7975| [47] [Watase]
540: 7978| [45] ["Oh c'mon, Teach... I see you're as blunt as always."]
541: 8004| [47] [Ena]
542: 8007| [45] ["Well, it was more like I was on the fence about the issue."]
543: 8033| [47] [Ena]
544: 8036| [45] ["But it looks like you were telling the truth, and that you really did get some of your memory back."]
545: 8044| [47] [Ena]
546: 8047| [45] ["Why don't you just think of this as a rare and valuable experience?"]
547: 8055| [47] [Watase]
548: 8058| [45] ["H-hey...!"]
549: 8084| [47] [Jun]
550: 8087| [45] ["Positive thinking has its limits, you know."]
551: 8113| [47] [Kazami]
552: 8116| [45] ["But it is indeed a valuable experience."]
553: 8121| [45] [The group laughed slightly at those words.]
554: 8126| [45] [It was more of a fake laugh intended to try to make them all forget about the events of the last few minutes, but it still relieved Watase.]
555: 8131| [45] [Their escape route had been cut off, another body had been found, and they'd lost Yuuri on top of all that... everyone was starting to get on edge.]
556: 8136| [45] [And their exhaustion was just piling up.]
557: 8141| [45] [So it was pretty much inevitable that a few arguments would pop up.]
558: 8146| [47] [Watase]
559: 8147| [45] [(That's right, I shouldn't worry about it. Everyone falling to pieces would be the worst possible situation at a time like this.)]
560: 8152| [47] [Watase]
561: 8153| [45] [(And besides, the search isn't over yet...)]
562: 8158| [45] [As a result, Watase forced himself to end his train of thought on the whole matter right then and there.]
