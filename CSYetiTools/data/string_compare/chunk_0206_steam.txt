  1:   58| [45] [--It was a story that happened after they had set Sirius free outside the gate.]
  2:   63| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro had run away from the guard stationed there.]
  3:   68| [45] [And as they ran recklessly--]
  4:  113| [45] [--they found themselves at a ruined factory at the edge of town before they knew it.]
  5:  118| [45] [It was the place they had turned into their "secret base".]
  6:  126| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  129| [45] ["Haah... haah..."]
  8:  191| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  194| [45] ["Whew, whew..."]
 10:  202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  205| [45] ["Haah... ha, hahah... ahahahah..."]
 12:  231| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  234| [45] ["Eheheh... ahahahah..."]
 14:  242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  245| [45] ["Yes! We set Sirius free!"]
 16:  289| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  292| [45] ["Yeah! We did it! We did it!"]
 18:  297| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro laughed out loud.]
 19:  302| [45] [What they felt the most wasn't the sadness of parting with Sirius, nor the fear of getting caught by the guard, but rather the sense that they had truly accomplished something.]
 20:  307| [45] [They had saved a life. Natsuhiko was glad and proud of himself.]
 21:  312| [45] [He had experienced some terribly mortifying memories in that ruined factory--%Nbut for that moment, he had forgotten about them.]
 22:  320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  323| [45] ["Hey, Mashiro."]
 24:  349| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  352| [45] ["What, Natsuhiko?"]
 26:  360| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  363| [45] ["We've been rivals so far, but now and forever, we're allies of justice, aren't we?"]
 28:  407| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  410| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 30:  418| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  421| [45] ["Let's keep protecting the town's peace!"]
 32:  483| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  486| [45] ["Yeah, yeah!"]
 34:  512| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  515| [45] ["'Don't wait for someone else to protect what you hold dear. Protect it with your own hands', right?"]
 36:  520| [45] [Mashiro smiled softly as she spoke.]
 37:  525| [45] [Natsuhiko lost his breath.]
 38:  533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  536| [45] ["..."]
 40:  541| [45] [Not because she had quoted him.]
 41:  546| [45] [But because Mashiro's smile looked strangely charming to him in the moonlight.]
 42:  572| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  575| [45] ["Huh? What's wrong? Your face is red?"]
 44:  583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  586| [45] ["N-no! It's nothing!"]
 46:  612| [47] [Mashiro]
 47:  615| [45] ["Hmm... you're weird."]
 48:  620| [45] [Mashiro tilted her head and suddenly changed the subject.]
 49:  646| [47] [Mashiro]
 50:  649| [45] ["Anyway, what do we do after this?"]
 51:  657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  660| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean?"]
 53:  686| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  689| [45] ["If we go home now, our moms will surely be angry, right? It's so late at night, after all."]
 55:  697| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  700| [45] ["Geh, now that you mention it..."]
 57:  705| [45] [He hadn't thought about it.]
 58:  710| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke the first thing that came to mind.]
 59:  718| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  721| [45] ["... Then why don't we go on a 'journey of justice' together?"]
 61:  765| [47] [Mashiro]
 62:  768| [45] ["Ah, I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds good! Let's do it, let's do it!"]
 63:  776| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  779| [45] ["I know, right?"]
 65:  787| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  790| [45] ["We'll get a buncha bad guys. We'll punish the evil health care center, too.'"]
 67:  816| [47] [Mashiro]
 68:  819| [45] ["If we do, then Sirius can come back to town, right?"]
 69:  827| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  830| [45] ["Yeah, someday!"]
 71:  856| [47] [Mashiro]
 72:  859| [45] ["But in that case, it looks like we've got a lot of enemies ahead of us..."]
 73:  885| [47] [Mashiro]
 74:  888| [45] ["So we need more allies to help us, don't we?"]
 75:  896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  899| [45] ["Hahah, it really would be tough for just the two of us, huh."]
 77:  904| [45] [Their fun laughter echoed in the dark secret base.]
 78:  909| [45] [However, Natsuhiko knew, and Mashiro probably noticed it too:]
 79:  914| [45] [It was impossible for two children like them to go out on a journey all by themselves.]
 80:  919| [45] [But Natsuhiko chose to ignore that reality as he spoke up cheerfully.]
 81:  927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82:  930| [45] ["Well, nothing we can do about that right now. I guess let's put the journey on pause... and just go home for today!"]
 83:  956| [47] [Mashiro]
 84:  959| [45] ["Mmm, too bad. We have to go home just to get scolded...?"]
 85:  967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86:  970| [45] ["Don't let it get to you. We did what we did to fulfill heroic duties."]
 87:  978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88:  981| [45] ["So let's not sneak around like cowards, but march as heroes! Let's go!"]
 89:  986| [45] [Natsuhiko took Mashiro by the hand and started to walk.]
 90: 1047| [47] [Mashiro]
 91: 1050| [45] ["..."]
 92: 1055| [45] [For a second, Mashiro looked surprised--]
 93: 1081| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1084| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 95: 1089| [45] [But she soon replied with a broad grin.]
 96: 1094| [45] [--As he saw her smile, Natsuhiko thought to himself.]
 97: 1099| [45] [If only this journey could continue forever instead of ending when they got home.]
 98: 1104| [45] [He felt like he could walk like this anywhere so long as Mashiro was with him--]
