  0:    7| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 1]
  1:   38| [47] [Mashiro]
  2:   41| [45] ["Huh, what's wrong?"]
  3:   49| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   52| [45] ["Doesn't something seem odd to you about that car?"]
  5:   57| [45] [Natsuhiko had caught sight of a car weaving back and forth precariously out of its lane.]
  6:   62| [45] [It strayed off the road and started heading towards Natsuhiko and Mashiro at the bus stop--!]
  7:   71| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:   74| [45] ["!? Mashiro!!"]
  9:  100| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  103| [45] ["Kyah!?"]
 11:  194| [45] [Right after Natsuhiko pulled Mashiro by the hand, the sound of an intense impact rang out.]
 12:  199| [45] [The car had crashed into the roadside trees right beside the bus stop.]
 13:  204| [45] [But that still was not enough to stop the momentum of the car, which then started to spin out--]
 14:  277| [45] [Only stopping once it collided into a street light.]
 15:  355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  358| [45] ["Mashiro, are you okay!?"]
 17:  366| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  369| [45] ["I-I'm fine..."]
 19:  395| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  398| [45] ["But the driver!"]
 21:  475| [45] [The crashed car was smashed in the front; the doors were horribly crumpled.]
 22:  480| [45] [As a result, the driver was trapped in the car without an easy way out.]
 23:  533| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  536| [45] ["Ahhh! W-we gotta help him!"]
 25:  544| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  547| [45] ["Calm down, Mashiro. There's nothing ordinary bystanders like us can do. We should call an ambulance instead--"]
 27:  573| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  576| [45] ["Wh-what are you saying!? An accident just happened right in front of us!"]
 29:  614| [45] [Ignoring Natsuhiko, Mashiro ran straight towards the scene of the accident.]
 30:  629| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  632| [45] ["Ah! Hey, wait, Mashiro!"]
 32:  639| [45] [He looked at the car as he screamed--]
 33:  690| [45] [And realized that there was a familiar face sitting in the driver's seat.]
 34:  872| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  875| [45] ["Mr. Ukita...!?"]
 36:  880| [45] [It was Natsuhiko's neighbor and his mother's coworker, Keiji Ukita.]
 37:  888| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  891| [45] ["Huh!? M-Mr. Ukita!? A-are you okay!?"]
 39:  899| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  902| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 41:  907| [45] [Ukita had no conspicuous injuries.]
 42:  912| [45] [However, he appeared to not be fully conscious, perhaps due to a concussion.]
 43: 1003| [47] [Onlooker 1]
 44: 1006| [45] ["What? An accident?"]
 45: 1011| [47] [Onlooker 2]
 46: 1014| [45] ["That hardly happens in this city."]
 47: 1019| [45] [Onlookers gathered all at once.]
 48: 1024| [45] [Mashiro yelled, ignoring them.]
 49: 1124| [47] [Mashiro]
 50: 1127| [45] ["Please hold on. I'll get you out of there right now!"]
 51: 1133| [45] [But then--]
 52: 1228| [45] [An odd dripping noise could be heard mixed in with Mashiro's voice.]
 53: 1233| [45] [And a noxious scent could be smelled wafting through the air.]
 54: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1245| [45] [(Gasoline!?)]
 56: 1415| [45] [The impact of the crash had caused gasoline to leak and start evaporating.]
 57: 1420| [45] [In this day and age, most passenger vehicles were electric. This particular car, however, was a hybrid, a dying breed.]
 58: 1425| [45] [If the impact of the crash were to start a fire-- there'd be an explosion!]
 59: 1545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60: 1546| [45] [(Mashiro's gonna get caught in it!)]
 61: 1622| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, something snapped in his head.]
 62: 1709| [85] [{Get away from there, Mashiro!! There's gasoline!!}]
 63: 1710| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1711| [86] [{Get away from there, Mashiro!! There's gasoline!!}]
 65: 1821| [47] [Mashiro]
 66: 1824| [45] ["!?"]
 67: 1829| [45] [Mashiro reflexively jumped back upon hearing that thunderous "voice".]
 68: 1834| [45] [No, not just Mashiro.]
 69: 1902| [45] [All the onlookers shrank away with looks of surprise on their faces.]
 70: 1910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1913| [45] ["Ah..."]
 72: 1918| [45] [Even Natsuhiko himself was surprised.]
 73: 1923| [45] [That "mental voice" stopped everyone in a visible radius in their tracks.]
 74: 1928| [45] [--Natsuhiko's telepathy reached the minds of everyone.]
 75: 1933| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1934| [45] ["--..."]
 77: 1939| [45] [But this wasn't the time to be surprised.]
 78: 1944| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1945| [45] [(Th-that's right! Gotta call an ambulance!)]
 80: 1997| [45] [Natsuhiko took out his PDA with that in mind.]
 81: 2008| [45] [He brought up the phone function and dialed 119.]
 82: 2013| [45] [The line connected immediately.]
 83: 2086| [45] ["Emergency services. How may I help you?"]
 84: 2106| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 2109| [45] ["--There's been a traffic accident. A car crashed into a street light."]
 86: 2117| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 2120| [45] ["Someone's trapped inside. Also, there's a gas leak. It might explode."]
 88: 2141| [45] ["Thank you for your report. Pardon me, but mind identifying yourself?"]
 89: 2161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 2164| [45] ["Natsuhiko Tenkawa, high school student at Rokumei Academy. Please see the city database."]
 91: 2185| [45] ["Sorry for the intrusion. Where did the accident occur?"]
 92: 2205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 2208| [45] ["Center Street, close to the shopping area exit."]
 94: 2228| [45] ["Understood. We currently have a rescue squad dispatched on another case nearby that area."]
 95: 2239| [45] ["We'll redirect some of the members your way."]
 96: 2291| [45] [And thus, the call center hung up.]
 97: 2379| [45] [When Natsuhiko put away his PDA, he found Mashiro had come up beside him.]
 98: 2387| [47] [Mashiro]
 99: 2390| [45] ["Natsuhiko, was that... BC?"]
100: 2398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 2401| [45] ["... Y-yeah, I guess."]
102: 2424| [45] [Natsuhiko answered ambiguously.]
103: 2475| [45] [He never expected that he could've used BC himself.]
104: 2480| [45] [Because he hadn't ever used it before in his entire life.]
105: 2485| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 2486| [45] [(Why do I get the feeling that was a particularly strong use of telepathy...?)]
107: 2505| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 2508| [45] ["Well... more importantly, what about Mr. Ukita?"]
109: 2559| [45] [Ukita appeared to be truly stuck.]
110: 2564| [45] [The stench of gasoline got even stronger. The car could've exploded at any moment.]
111: 2616| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 2619| [45] ["I-I wonder if he'll be okay..."]
113: 2627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 2630| [45] ["Calm down, the rescue squad's coming now... so let's try to wait and not panic."]
115: 2635| [45] [Mashiro nodded.]
116: 2640| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and all the onlookers watched over the car in bated breath.]
117: 2697| [45] [And soon enough, the sound of a siren could suddenly be heard.]
118: 2702| [45] [At its source was an ambulance and a long red vehicle like a fire truck.]
119: 2719| [45] [The two cars stopped by the scene of the accident, and out of the red truck jumped two women.]
120: 2856| [47] [???]
121: 2859| [45] ["Is this the scene of the accident?"]
122: 2864| [45] [One of the women shouted and looked at Natsuhiko.]
123: 2869| [45] [Based on their orange uniforms, they appeared to be rescue workers.]
124: 2877| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 2880| [45] ["Yes, I'm the one who called in the report."]
126: 2888| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 1]
127: 2891| [45] ["Understood. Please stand back; it's too dangerous."]
128: 2918| [47] [Mashiro]
129: 2921| [45] ["P-please hurry... the gas! Mr. Ukita!"]
130: 2990| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 2]
131: 2993| [45] ["Relax. We're on the scene."]
132: 3094| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 3097| [45] ["Okay. C'mon, Mashiro, let's back away so we don't get in their way."]
134: 3138| [47] [Mashiro]
135: 3141| [45] ["R-right..."]
136: 3221| [45] [Natsuhiko grabbed Mashiro by the hand and took her further away from the scene of the accident.]
137: 3272| [45] [The rescue workers' voices rang out.]
138: 3280| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 1]
139: 3283| [45] ["Moribe, what's the situation!?"]
140: 3291| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 2]
141: 3294| [45] ["No sources of fire in the area! Lots of gasoline vapor, though!"]
142: 3303| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 1]
143: 3306| [45] ["Then let's hose it down! Suppress the static electricity!"]
144: 3314| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 2]
145: 3317| [45] ["Roger!"]
146: 3501| [45] [A male squad member's voice added to the noise as well.]
147: 3510| [47] [Rescue Worker 1]
148: 3513| [45] ["Dojima, get the engine cutter ready! Hiyama, get the air jack!"]
149: 3518| [47] [Team]
150: 3521| [45] ["Roger!"]
151: 3538| [47] [Rescue Worker 1]
152: 3541| [45] ["Open the door as soon as the hosing's done! First-aid, get the stretcher ready, stat!"]
153: 3547| [45] [He bellowed out commands at the scene of the accident.]
154: 3558| [45] [And after the hosing was done, they wrenched open the car door with something resembling an electric saw and a jack--]
155: 3792| [45] [And in the blink of an eye, Ukita was rescued.]
156: 3818| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 2]
157: 3821| [45] ["Alrighty! You're safe now, sir!"]
158: 3829| [47] [Ukita]
159: 3832| [45] ["U... gh... thank you..."]
160: 3837| [47] [Onlookers]
161: 3840| [45] ["Woaaahh!!"]
162: 3845| [45] [The onlookers cheered.]
163: 3903| [45] [The female squad member smiled triumphantly as she laid Ukita down on the stretcher.]
164: 3989| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 3992| [45] ["S-so cool!"]
166: 3997| [45] [Mashiro cheered as she watched the female squad member at work.]
167: 4005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 4008| [45] ["More importantly, let's go. I'm worried about Mr. Ukita."]
169: 4034| [47] [Mashiro]
170: 4037| [45] ["Ah, right!"]
171: 4093| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro rushed up to the stretcher the rescue squad was carrying.]
172: 4103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 4106| [45] ["Mr. Ukita!"]
174: 4114| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 4117| [45] ["Um, are you okay!?"]
176: 4125| [47] [Ukita]
177: 4128| [45] ["Huh... oh, Natsuhiko, Mashiro..."]
178: 4194| [45] [Ukita got off the stretcher once he noticed the two of them.]
179: 4248| [47] [F. Rescue Worker 2]
180: 4251| [45] ["Wait, sir, please stop! We need to take you into the ambulance--"]
181: 4277| [47] [Ukita]
182: 4280| [45] ["Ah, I'm sorry... but please let me talk to these kids for a second."]
183: 4312| [45] [The squad member hesitated for a second, but then nodded reluctantly.]
184: 4367| [47] [Mashiro]
185: 4370| [45] ["You sure? What about your injuries--"]
186: 4396| [47] [Ukita]
187: 4399| [45] ["I-I'm okay... My ribs hurt somewhat, but I can manage..."]
188: 4407| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 4410| [45] ["Thank goodness. You had us worried."]
190: 4436| [47] [Ukita]
191: 4439| [45] ["Anyway, was that your telepathy back there, Natsuhiko?"]
192: 4447| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 4450| [45] ["Y-yeah... probably. That's the first time I've ever used it, though."]
194: 4476| [47] [Ukita]
195: 4479| [45] ["I see..."]
196: 4487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 4490| [45] ["Um, so what about it?"]
198: 4516| [47] [Ukita]
199: 4519| [45] ["Mmm..."]
200: 4524| [45] [Ukita fell silent for a moment and then gazed at Natsuhiko before continuing.]
201: 4550| [47] [Ukita]
202: 4553| [45] ["Listen closely, you two. This is important."]
203: 4561| [47] [Ukita]
204: 4564| [45] ["Strange things might start happening around you from now on."]
205: 4572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 4575| [45] ["Huh...? What do you mean?"]
207: 4601| [47] [Ukita]
208: 4604| [45] ["Hopefully I'm just being a little paranoid... no, I probably am."]
209: 4630| [47] [Ukita]
210: 4633| [45] ["But for now, just please be careful...!"]
211: 4641| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 4644| [45] ["...?"]
213: 4649| [45] [Natsuhiko was bewildered and did not understand.]
214: 4723| [45] [And leaving his cryptic warning at that, Ukita was taken into the ambulance...]
215: 4792| [45] [Leaving behind only Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and some of the onlookers.]
216: 4845| [47] [Mashiro]
217: 4848| [45] ["Huh. Wonder what that was all about..."]
218: 4853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 4854| [45] ["..."]
220: 4880| [47] [Mashiro]
221: 4883| [45] ["Was it because you used BC? Maybe he was worried since you violated the ordinance."]
222: 4891| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 4894| [45] ["No..."]
224: 4899| [45] [He had a feeling that that wasn't quite it, but he didn't have any idea what else it could've been.]
225: 4976| [45] [And at that moment-- someone caught his sight out of the corner of his eye.]
226: 4999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 5000| [45] [(Hmm...?)]
228: 5123| [45] [When he got a better look, there stood an unfamiliar girl holding a stuffed animal.]
229: 5296| [47] [???]
230: 5299| [45] ["..."]
231: 5304| [45] [She was standing among the dispersing onlookers from a distance, looking directly Natsuhiko's way.]
232: 5355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 5356| [45] [(Is she looking at the accident... no, at me?)]
234: 5361| [45] [The girl seemed to be wearing the same Rokumei Academy High School uniform as Natsuhiko and Mashiro, but--]
235: 5366| [47] [Natsuhiko]
236: 5367| [45] [(Who is that...? Have I ever seen a blonde girl like that at school...?)]
237: 5372| [45] [Her piercing eyes seemed to conflict with her completely disinterested expression...]
238: 5436| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 5439| [45] ["Mashiro..."]
240: 5444| [45] [Feeling something of unrest from the girl, Natsuhiko stepped up between her and Mashiro.]
241: 5449| [45] [And with a defiant posture, he glared back at the girl.]
242: 5518| [45] [But eventually, the girl looked away-- and left.]
243: 5630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 5633| [45] ["... Mashiro, you okay?"]
245: 5659| [47] [Mashiro]
246: 5662| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean?"]
247: 5670| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 5673| [45] ["Uh, well..."]
249: 5678| [45] [Mashiro didn't seem to have noticed the girl's presence.]
250: 5686| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 5689| [45] ["... It's nothing. Let's go home."]
252: 5715| [47] [Mashiro]
253: 5718| [45] ["Yeah..."]
254: 5751| [45] [And with that exchange, the two of them left.]
255: 5760| [45] [--Something about the way she looked at him disturbed Natsuhiko.]
256: 5765| [45] [But he looked the girl back in the eyes.]
257: 5770| [45] [There was something familiar about the look in her eyes.]
258: 5775| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 5776| [45] [(Where have I seen those eyes before...?)]
260: 5892| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko pondered those eyes, the girl turned away and disappeared into the crowd of onlookers.]
261: 5897| [47] [Natsuhiko]
262: 5898| [45] [(...?)]
263: 5903| [45] [It bugged him, but before he could get an answer--]
264: 5999| [47] [Mashiro]
265: 6002| [45] ["... What's wrong, Natsuhiko? Let's go home."]
266: 6010| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 6013| [45] ["... Y-yeah."]
268: 6046| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko left the scene with Mashiro.]
269: 6054| [45] [A chill ran down Natsuhiko's spine.]
270: 6166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
271: 6169| [45] ["Mashiro, let's get out of here..."]
272: 6195| [47] [Mashiro]
273: 6198| [45] ["Huh? Huh?"]
274: 6290| [45] [Natsuhiko grabbed Mashiro by the arm and got away from there.]
275: 6295| [45] [He was driven by an unfamiliar instinct of fear.]
276: 6303| [47] [Mashiro]
277: 6306| [45] ["Hey, what happened?"]
278: 6314| [47] [Natsuhiko]
279: 6317| [45] ["... It's nothing."]
280: 6369| [45] [He looked once over his shoulder, but by then, the girl had long since disappeared...]
