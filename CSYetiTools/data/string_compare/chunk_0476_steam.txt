  0:   53| [45] [--By the day after Tanabata, Watase and Kazami had returned to their usual captain/subordinate relationship.]
  1:   58| [45] [They would occasionally get into fights about how they should go about their job.]
  2:   63| [45] [Then one day, a little accident occurred.]
  3:   68| [45] [Kazami got a light burn while trying to save a little girl during a dispatch.]
  4:  134| [45] [Once they got back to the fire station, Watase proceeded to scold her harshly for her recklessness.]
  5:  166| [47] [Watase]
  6:  169| [45] ["--You're a capable one, but there's also a somewhat unstable side to you."]
  7:  177| [47] [Watase]
  8:  180| [45] ["You're so reckless I can't even bear to watch. Just make sure you correct that aspect of yourself, if nothing else."]
  9:  188| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  191| [45] ["Y... yes sir."]
 11:  196| [45] [Kazami looked unusually dejected after she had been scolded.]
 12:  201| [45] [For that one moment, it reminded Watase of how she'd looked right after she'd lost her sister--]
 13:  206| [45] [And thus he found himself blurting out:]
 14:  214| [47] [Watase]
 15:  217| [45] ["... Well, but then again, I do get where you're coming from."]
 16:  225| [47] [Watase]
 17:  228| [45] ["You must still be haunted by what happened to your sister."]
 18:  289| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  292| [45] ["..."]
 20:  297| [45] [Kazami's eyes widened.]
 21:  305| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  308| [45] ["C-Captain, do you mean... you remember me?"]
 23:  316| [47] [Watase]
 24:  319| [45] ["Hmm? Yeah..."]
 25:  376| [47] [Watase]
 26:  379| [45] ["There's no way I could ever forget you... That was the first time I had ever seen a woman look so heartbroken."]
 27:  387| [47] [Watase]
 28:  390| [45] ["I didn't say anything about it because I figured it was something you didn't really want to remember..."]
 29:  423| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  426| [45] ["N-no, my apologies!"]
 31:  452| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  455| [45] ["All this time, I've wanted to thank you for what you did back then myself...!"]
 33:  463| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  466| [45] ["Thank you very much for delivering my sister's present!"]
 35:  474| [47] [Watase]
 36:  477| [45] ["Nah, don't mention it."]
 37:  482| [45] [Watase patted Kazami on the shoulder with a smile.]
 38:  533| [45] [--Perhaps that was what triggered it all.]
 39:  538| [45] [After that day, Watase and Kazami's relationship began to change.]
 40:  543| [45] [No, perhaps a more accurate way of phrasing that would be "Kazami began to act strangely".]
 41:  548| [45] [For example, she would look away from Watase whenever he tried talking to her.]
 42:  553| [45] [And she would run off if they ever crossed paths on the way home...]
 43:  558| [47] [Watase]
 44:  559| [45] [(What's going on...? Does she hate me now or something?)]
 45:  564| [47] [Watase]
 46:  565| [45] [(Did I do something to her?)]
 47:  570| [45] [Perhaps bringing up her past the other day had been the wrong call after all.]
 48:  575| [45] [Her behavior also made Watase uneasy, making their relationship awkward.]
 49:  647| [45] [--But one day shortly afterwards--]
 50:  652| [45] [Kazami walked up to him as he was in the middle of his independent training on the fire station grounds.]
 51:  685| [47] [Kazami]
 52:  688| [45] ["Um... Captain?"]
 53:  696| [47] [Watase]
 54:  699| [45] ["Hmm? What's up, Tachibana?"]
 55:  704| [45] [For a moment, he thought she'd come to apologize for her rudeness, but what she said next was truly surprising.]
 56:  712| [47] [Kazami]
 57:  715| [45] ["When... is your next day off?"]
 58:  723| [47] [Watase]
 59:  726| [45] ["Huh? Well, that came out of nowhere."]
 60:  781| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  784| [45] ["J-just answer me, please."]
 62:  789| [45] [There was something ghastly about her expression.]
 63:  794| [45] [Though he found that puzzling, Watase answered anyway.]
 64:  802| [47] [Watase]
 65:  805| [45] ["... It's right up there on the shifts chart, right? Thursday."]
 66:  831| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  834| [45] ["What a coincidence...!"]
 68:  842| [47] [Watase]
 69:  845| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 70:  871| [47] [Kazami]
 71:  874| [45] ["Actually, I have Thursday off too. Strange, isn't it?"]
 72:  882| [47] [Watase]
 73:  885| [45] ["There's nothing strange about it. That's how our rotation's always worked."]
 74:  893| [47] [Watase]
 75:  896| [45] ["Anyway, what are you trying to say?"]
 76:  922| [47] [Kazami]
 77:  925| [45] ["How do you spend your days off?"]
 78:  935| [47] [Watase]
 79:  938| [45] ["Huh?"]
 80:  949| [45] [It felt like he and Kazami were talking about two different things.]
 81:  954| [47] [Watase]
 82:  955| [45] [(This conversation feels like it's totally out of order... Does she have a fever or something?)]
 83:  960| [45] [Watase answered despite his confusion.]
 84:  968| [47] [Watase]
 85:  971| [45] ["... Hmm, well, let's see. I don't have much in the way of hobbies."]
 86:  979| [47] [Watase]
 87:  982| [45] ["I usually just train... and, well, I also listen to music while I'm at it."]
 88:  990| [47] [Kazami]
 89:  993| [45] ["Music? What genres in particular?"]
 90: 1001| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1004| [45] ["Mostly classical."]
 92: 1030| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1033| [45] ["Classical...!"]
 94: 1041| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1044| [45] ["I don't look the type, huh? But I've loved it ever since I was a kid."]
 96: 1049| [45] [Kazami fell quiet at Watase's explanation-- then she raised her voice as if she'd resolved herself.]
 97: 1075| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1078| [45] ["I-I like classical too!"]
 99: 1086| [47] [Watase]
100: 1089| [45] ["Oh, really?"]
101: 1115| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1118| [45] ["Yes. Like Chopin, and Mozart, and Beethoven... and Chopin."]
103: 1126| [47] [Watase]
104: 1129| [45] ["... You sure like Chopin, huh?"]
105: 1155| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1158| [45] ["Yes. He's, uh, the piano one, right?"]
107: 1230| [47] [Kazami]
108: 1233| [45] ["'I Want You'... is what he's famous for, right...?"]
109: 1239| [45] [Watase was tempted to say "That's Erik Satie", but held his tongue.]
110: 1244| [47] [Watase]
111: 1245| [45] [(Looks like she knows very little... no, -nothing- about classical music...)]
112: 1250| [47] [Watase]
113: 1251| [45] [(So why's she telling such a silly lie like that?)]
114: 1256| [45] [Watase pondered the reason for Kazami's incomprehensible actions.]
115: 1349| [45] [Soon enough-- an answer flashed through his head.]
116: 1402| [47] [Watase]
117: 1403| [45] [(... It can't be...)]
118: 1408| [47] [Watase]
119: 1409| [45] [(Could it be...)]
120: 1414| [47] [Watase]
121: 1415| [45] [(That Tachibana...)]
122: 1426| [47] [Watase]
123: 1427| [45] [(Likes me!?)]
124: 1432| [45] [The answer flashed through his head like lightning, sending a shock through Watase's body.]
125: 1463| [45] [But Kazami was about 25 years old, now that he thought about it. And now that he looked at her closely, she did have an attractive face.]
126: 1468| [45] [So he would have expected her to have some experience in romance by this point.]
127: 1473| [45] [Yet why was she acting like some lovestruck schoolgirl talking to her first crush?]
128: 1506| [47] [Watase]
129: 1507| [45] [(A-am I thinking too highly of myself...? Wait, but...)]
130: 1512| [45] [Watase had been through multiple relationships, but he'd been so busy with work lately that he was a bachelor as the moment.]
131: 1517| [45] [So Kazami being in love with him wasn't a problem, but--]
132: 1522| [47] [Watase]
133: 1523| [45] [(I can't figure out what she really feels...!)]
134: 1556| [45] [Watase answered Kazami while keeping his guard up slightly.]
135: 1564| [47] [Watase]
136: 1567| [45] ["A-ah... uh, so hey, Tachibana?"]
137: 1593| [47] [Kazami]
138: 1596| [45] ["Huh...?"]
139: 1605| [47] [Watase]
140: 1608| [45] ["The NDK Symphony will be having a concert at the Rokumei City Hall soon, so..."]
141: 1616| [47] [Watase]
142: 1619| [45] ["Would you like to come see it with me?"]
143: 1645| [47] [Kazami]
144: 1648| [45] ["Definitely!"]
145: 1653| [45] [--An instant reply.]
146: 1658| [45] [Watase was relieved to see a happy smile spread across Kazami's face.]
147: 1663| [47] [Watase]
148: 1664| [45] [(But man, I didn't expect there to be late bloomers like her in this day and age...)]
149: 1669| [45] [But he wasn't unhappy about this new discovery in the slightest.]
150: 1674| [45] [Despite that thought, Watase still managed to hide his feelings and return Kazami's smile.]
151: 1726| [45] [--After that, Watase and Kazami would spend many of their days off together...]
152: 1731| [45] [And it wasn't long before they decided to officially start dating.]
153: 1736| [45] [Thus was the beginning of Watase and Kazami's intimate relationship...]
154: 1744| [45] [--But no matter how hard he thought about it, he couldn't figure it out.]
155: 1752| [47] [Watase]
156: 1755| [45] ["Tachibana, you... don't actually know all that much about classical music, do you?"]
157: 1816| [47] [Kazami]
158: 1819| [45] ["Huh? Ah, no, I..."]
159: 1827| [47] [Watase]
160: 1830| [45] ["It's okay, you don't have to lie. There's nothing embarrassing about not knowing."]
161: 1835| [45] [Kazami nodded timidly at Watase's kind words.]
162: 1861| [47] [Kazami]
163: 1864| [45] ["Y-yes... I'll study up on it."]
164: 1872| [47] [Watase]
165: 1875| [45] ["I see. Then I'll lend you some CDs the next chance I get. I've got all kinds of famous recordings."]
166: 1901| [47] [Kazami]
167: 1904| [45] ["CDs? ... That sure is old-fashioned."]
168: 1912| [47] [Watase]
169: 1915| [45] ["Shut up. That's just my thing, okay?"]
170: 1920| [45] [Watase's comment finally brought Kazami to a smile.]
171: 1946| [47] [Kazami]
172: 1949| [45] ["Thank you so much, Captain. I'm looking forward to it."]
173: 1957| [47] [Watase]
174: 1960| [45] ["Got it."]
175: 1967| [47] [Watase]
176: 1968| [45] [(Whew... I don't know what that was all about, but I'm glad it ended so well...)]
