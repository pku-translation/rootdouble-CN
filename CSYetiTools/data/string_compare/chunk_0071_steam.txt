  1:  160| [47] [Watase]
  2:  163| [45] ["Ghh... ugh..."]
  3:  177| [45] [Watase forced himself to stay conscious, and then opened his eyes.]
  4:  182| [45] [Everything around him was engulfed in thick dust.]
  5:  187| [47] [Watase]
  6:  188| [45] [(What the hell just happened...?)]
  7:  193| [45] [It seemed that the small fire had ignited something, causing an explosion.]
  8:  198| [45] [But as to what that "something" was--]
  9:  203| [47] [Watase]
 10:  204| [45] [(Don't tell me...)]
 11:  209| [45] [Watase then heard a voice under him.]
 12:  217| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  220| [45] ["U-ugh..."]
 14:  225| [45] [It was Kazami. She was lying on the floor, shielded by Watase.]
 15:  306| [47] [Watase]
 16:  309| [45] ["!? Tachibana, you okay!?"]
 17:  335| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  338| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 19:  343| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase with trembling eyes-- then her face warped in agony.]
 20:  404| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  407| [45] ["Ugh!"]
 22:  415| [47] [Watase]
 23:  418| [45] ["Wh-what's wrong!?"]
 24:  426| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  429| [45] ["... M-my leg..."]
 26:  437| [47] [Watase]
 27:  440| [45] ["!?"]
 28:  445| [45] [Watase looked down to see a scrap of iron about 15 cm long impaling Kazami's left calf.]
 29:  450| [45] [As he stared at it, he saw blood ooze out of the wound and drip onto the floor.]
 30:  458| [47] [Watase]
 31:  461| [45] ["What the...!?"]
 32:  466| [45] [A voice came from the stairwell at that moment.]
 33:  474| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  477| [45] ["Heeeey, guys! Are you okay!?"]
 35:  482| [45] [It seemed Ukita was unharmed.]
 36:  490| [47] [Watase]
 37:  493| [45] ["Tachibana, wait here, I'll be right back."]
 38:  498| [45] [Watase then ran over to the stairwell.]
 39:  599| [45] [The explosion had completely destroyed the staircase.]
 40:  604| [45] [Watase looked up to find Ukita gazing down at him from the open doorway to B1.]
 41:  612| [47] [Watase]
 42:  615| [45] ["You okay, old man!?"]
 43:  695| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  698| [45] ["Yes, fortunately! How about you guys!?"]
 45:  706| [47] [Watase]
 46:  709| [45] ["Tachibana's hurt!"]
 47:  735| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  738| [45] ["What!? Then what's the status of her wound!?"]
 49:  746| [47] [Watase]
 50:  749| [45] ["It's not life threatening, but her leg's in bad shape! I'll take her to a nearby room and try to treat it!"]
 51:  757| [47] [Watase]
 52:  760| [45] ["What'll you do!?"]
 53:  786| [47] [Ukita]
 54:  789| [45] ["I can't get down the stairs in this state! I'll keep going through this floor and search the next area!"]
 55:  797| [47] [Watase]
 56:  800| [45] ["Got it! Then take this!"]
 57:  805| [45] [Watase took out his Procyon and tossed it up the stairs.]
 58:  831| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  834| [45] ["I've got it! Then I'll be going on ahead now!"]
 60:  842| [47] [Watase]
 61:  845| [45] ["Okay, but be very careful!"]
 62:  888| [45] [Watase finished up his talk with Ukita and hurried back over to Kazami.]
 63: 1065| [47] [Kazami]
 64: 1068| [45] ["... Ugh... khh..."]
 65: 1073| [45] [Kazami was trying to get up on her feet by herself.]
 66: 1078| [45] [But all it did was make her impaled leg hurt even worse. Her face just warped with agony%Nmore and more.]
 67: 1086| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1089| [45] ["You idiot! Don't push yourself in your condition!"]
 69: 1115| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1118| [45] ["I-I'm okay... a wound like this is-- n-nothing..."]
 71: 1134| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1137| [45] ["How the hell is that 'nothing'!? Look, just get on my back, okay!?"]
 73: 1142| [45] [Watase said that and squat down, his back facing Kazami.]
 74: 1168| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1171| [45] ["But then I will only be a hindrance to the search...!"]
 76: 1179| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1182| [45] ["Is this really the time to be saying that? Listen, you're wounded right now, so quit griping and do as I say!"]
 78: 1208| [47] [Kazami]
 79: 1211| [45] ["A-all right..."]
 80: 1254| [45] [Kazami put her weight on Watase's back.]
 81: 1259| [45] [Watase hurried on over to a nearby room, feeling the softness and weight of her body leaning against him.]
 82: 1270| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1273| [45] ["How the hell is that 'nothing'!? Look, just grab onto my shoulder!"]
 84: 1278| [45] [Watase said that and wrapped Kazami's arm around his shoulder.]
 85: 1304| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1307| [45] ["But then I will only be a hindrance to the search...!"]
 87: 1315| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1318| [45] ["You idiot, your treatment comes first!"]
 89: 1379| [45] [Kazami leaned her weight against Watase's shoulder.]
 90: 1384| [45] [Watase hurried on to a nearby room, supporting Kazami as they went.]
