  1:   62| [45] [--And thus, they successfully escaped from LABO.]
  2:   67| [45] [Everyone was exhausted and their bodies were battered beyond belief, but--]
  3:   72| [45] [Regardless, all nine had safely escaped with their lives!]
  4:  134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  137| [45] ["... Thanks, Watase."]
  6:  142| [45] [Natsuhiko thanked Watase.]
  7:  150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  153| [45] ["I thought we were done for time and time again, but... thanks to you, we're all saved!"]
  9:  214| [47] [Watase]
 10:  217| [45] ["..."]
 11:  240| [45] [Watase looked away in embarrassment.]
 12:  266| [47] [Watase]
 13:  269| [45] [".... I thought I told you that I don't deserve your gratitude."]
 14:  296| [47] [Yuuri]
 15:  299| [45] ["No, let me express my gratitude too."]
 16:  330| [47] [Yuuri]
 17:  333| [45] ["Thank you, Captain Kasasagi."]
 18:  359| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  362| [45] ["Thanks to your hard work, we're all really..."]
 20:  385| [45] [After seeing Yuuri get tearful again, Watase scratched his head.]
 21:  411| [47] [Watase]
 22:  414| [45] ["Look, I really don't need your thanks. I'm just keeping my end of the deal, that's all!"]
 23:  440| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  443| [45] ["Hahah, what're you being so bashful for?"]
 25:  469| [47] [Watase]
 26:  472| [45] ["That's not it at all, you brat."]
 27:  477| [45] [Watase looked away and then softly spoke.]
 28:  503| [47] [Watase]
 29:  506| [45] ["... We got out of there thanks to everyone's hard work."]
 30:  514| [47] [Watase]
 31:  517| [45] ["Everyone's minds became one those last ten minutes before the explosion."]
 32:  543| [47] [Watase]
 33:  546| [45] ["No... perhaps everyone's minds began to unify even before then."]
 34:  572| [47] [Watase]
 35:  575| [45] ["... Thanks to your BC."]
 36:  583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  586| [45] ["No, that's not it, Watase."]
 38:  591| [45] [Natsuhiko firmly refuted Watase's statement.]
 39:  599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  602| [45] ["All I did was use untargeted telepathy to tell everyone the 'truth'."]
 41:  610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  613| [45] ["And through that, sure, everyone came to know each other's feelings and began working for each other..."]
 43:  621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  624| [45] ["But that can all be achieved even without using BC, can't it?"]
 45:  650| [47] [Watase]
 46:  653| [45] ["... You think so?"]
 47:  661| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  664| [45] ["I do. I had no choice but to use that drastic measure because we had no time, but--"]
 49:  672| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  675| [45] ["I'm sure that by spending time to really talk to each other, time and time again... any two people should be able to understand one another."]
 51:  683| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  686| [45] ["Even without using BC."]
 53:  691| [45] [Natsuhiko wished for that to be the case.]
 54:  696| [45] [Yuuri nodded.]
 55:  722| [47] [Yuuri]
 56:  725| [45] ["I think so too, Captain Kasasagi."]
 57:  751| [47] [Yuuri]
 58:  754| [45] ["The nine of us had several conflicts of our own."]
 59:  780| [47] [Yuuri]
 60:  783| [45] ["But we resolved most of them without using BC, didn't we?"]
 61:  809| [47] [Watase]
 62:  812| [45] ["... True..."]
 63:  820| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  823| [45] ["Right. Take Jun and Prof. Tsubakiyama for example."]
 65:  849| [47] [Watase]
 66:  852| [45] ["Yeah. Those two bickered at first, but they stopped fighting before any of us knew it, didn't they?"]
 67:  860| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  863| [45] ["They sure did."]
 69:  886| [45] [The three survivors smiled at those words.]
 70:  912| [47] [Yuuri]
 71:  915| [45] ["You and Mr. Ukita were the same way too, huh, Captain Kasasagi?"]
 72:  923| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  926| [45] ["Now that you mention it, yeah."]
 74:  934| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  937| [45] ["When Watase lost his memories, the two of them fought and doubted each other..."]
 76:  963| [47] [Watase]
 77:  966| [45] ["Well, if you're going to bring that up, it was the same with you and me, Yuuri."]
 78:  992| [47] [Watase]
 79:  995| [45] ["I was bugged the hell out at first because I didn't understand why you hated me so much."]
 80: 1003| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1006| [45] ["Well that was all your fault, wasn't it?"]
 82: 1032| [47] [Yuuri]
 83: 1035| [45] ["That's right. You were really scary at first, you know?"]
 84: 1061| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1064| [45] ["M... my bad."]
 86: 1090| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1093| [45] ["No, no, I've already forgiven you."]
 88: 1119| [47] [Yuuri]
 89: 1122| [45] ["Compared to the wounds everyone else incurred, a little strangling's no big deal."]
 90: 1130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1133| [45] ["Huh? Yuuri, you've gotten kinda strong, haven't you?"]
 92: 1159| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1162| [45] ["You think so? Definitely not as strong as you, though, Hikorin."]
 94: 1185| [45] [Everyone laughed again.]
 95: 1211| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1214| [45] ["I don't know why, but I feel nostalgic... Somehow it all feels like an old story."]
 97: 1222| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1225| [45] ["You're right... Everything happened in just nine hours, but I guess it's because we sort of peered through nine entire lifetimes."]
 99: 1230| [45] [After he said that, Natsuhiko suddenly remembered something.]
100: 1235| [45] [He had to contact Mashiro and the others in the rescue copter and have them come pick them up.]
101: 1243| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1246| [45] ["Oh right, gotta contact Mashiro and the others."]
103: 1272| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1275| [45] ["Telepathy's perfect for times like these."]
105: 1283| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1286| [45] ["Sure is. Guess super-long distance telepathy really proved to be useful in the end, huh?"]
107: 1394| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and sent telepathy to Mashiro.]
108: 1402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1405| [45] [{Mashiro, can you hear me?}]
110: 1413| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1416| [45] [{We've escaped!}]
112: 1424| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1427| [45] [{We're at the shore of Lake Rokumei. Please pick us up with the helicopter if you can!}]
114: 1432| [45] [--No response from Mashiro.]
115: 1470| [45] [They were probably outside of her effective telepathy range.]
116: 1475| [45] [But Natsuhiko was confident that his own telepathy had reached her.]
117: 1483| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1486| [45] ["Watase, I called the helicopter just now."]
119: 1494| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1497| [45] ["We'll have nothing to worry about once we board. Let's escape to a safe place outside of Security Sector 6's reach."]
121: 1523| [47] [Watase]
122: 1526| [45] ["... I see."]
123: 1534| [47] [Watase]
124: 1537| [45] ["So this really is the end, huh..."]
125: 1571| [45] [Watase looked towards LABO.]
126: 1576| [45] [A pillar of smoke billowed up.]
127: 1581| [45] [It was likely an aftereffect of the tetryl bomb.]
128: 1586| [45] [There was no doubt a huge commotion around LABO right now.]
129: 1614| [47] [Watase]
130: 1617| [45] ["... We all got out alive, huh."]
131: 1643| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1646| [45] ["Yes, thanks to everyone's efforts."]
133: 1654| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1657| [45] ["So one ninth of that is thanks to you."]
135: 1683| [47] [Watase]
136: 1686| [45] ["That's true..."]
137: 1691| [45] [Watase spoke with a depressed voice.]
138: 1714| [45] [Something about his tone was worrying.]
139: 1725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1728| [45] ["... What's wrong, Watase? Do your wounds hurt?"]
141: 1751| [47] [Watase]
142: 1752| [45] ["..."]
143: 1757| [45] [Without answering Natsuhiko's question, Watase posed one of his own.]
144: 1785| [47] [Watase]
145: 1788| [45] ["... Say, Natsuhiko, Yuuri."]
146: 1796| [47] [Watase]
147: 1799| [45] ["You remember what happened right after you erased my malice, right?"]
148: 1807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1810| [45] ["Huh...?"]
150: 1843| [47] [Watase]
151: 1846| [45] ["I'm talking about that promise we made."]
152: 1851| [45] [The moment Watase said that,]
153: 1856| [45] [an abrupt coat of clouds covered the moon, casting his face in darkness.]
154: 1870| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 1873| [45] ["I... I do remember it, but..."]
156: 1900| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 1903| [45] ["... What about it...?"]
158: 1935| [47] [Watase]
159: 1938| [45] ["Remember what I said?"]
160: 1965| [45] [Watase's voice caused Natsuhiko's heart to throb in pain.]
161: 1973| [47] [Watase]
162: 1976| [45] ["'In exchange for helping everyone escape,"]
163: 2023| [47] [Watase]
164: 2026| [45] ["once this incident is over, I'll bring Yuuri over to Q'."]
165: 2040| [47] [Watase]
166: 2043| [45] ["... I kept my end of the bargain."]
167: 2051| [47] [Watase]
168: 2054| [45] ["So now..."]
169: 2059| [45] [As he spoke--]
170: 2148| [47] [Watase]
171: 2151| [45] ["It's time for you to keep yours."]
172: 2200| [45] [--Watase took the gun out of his pocket.]
