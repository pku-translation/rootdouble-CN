  0:   46| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 3]
  1:   63| [45] [--Watase and Jun let out a deep breath as soon as they made it back to the outer ring.]
  2:   71| [47] [Watase]
  3:   74| [45] ["Haah...!"]
  4:  136| [47] [Jun]
  5:  139| [45] ["Whew, that was nerve-wracking...!"]
  6:  147| [47] [Watase]
  7:  150| [45] ["Still, the danger was well worth it, wouldn't you say?"]
  8:  155| [45] [But Jun's face soon clouded over.]
  9:  181| [47] [Jun]
 10:  184| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 11:  192| [47] [Watase]
 12:  195| [45] ["Huh? Hey, what's wrong?"]
 13:  203| [47] [Jun]
 14:  206| [45] ["Ah, no, sorry... I just feel a little..."]
 15:  241| [47] [Jun]
 16:  244| [45] ["... Ugh!"]
 17:  249| [45] [Jun covered her mouth and bent over.]
 18:  257| [47] [Watase]
 19:  260| [45] ["Moribe!?"]
 20:  268| [47] [Jun]
 21:  271| [45] ["Captain, don't look! I'm gonna hurl!"]
 22:  279| [47] [Watase]
 23:  282| [45] ["Wait, what's that mean agai... ah!"]
 24:  299| [47] [Jun]
 25:  302| [45] ["Urrrrrrgh!"]
 26:  307| [45] [Jun turned her back on Watase and threw up in a corner of the hallway.]
 27:  312| [45] [Watase watched all that in dumbfoundment.]
 28:  317| [45] [Jun soon finished vomiting and managed a smile on her pale face.]
 29:  351| [47] [Jun]
 30:  354| [45] ["... Man, sorry you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed I wanna die."]
 31:  362| [47] [Watase]
 32:  365| [45] ["M-Moribe..."]
 33:  373| [47] [Watase]
 34:  376| [45] ["Hey, don't tell me you got radiation damage...!?"]
 35:  402| [47] [Jun]
 36:  405| [45] ["Huh? N-no, no, that's not it."]
 37:  431| [47] [Jun]
 38:  434| [45] ["I was just so nervous and ran around so much that my fatigue finally caught up with my stomach, that's all."]
 39:  442| [47] [Watase]
 40:  445| [45] ["Seriously!? Hey, let me see your wrist!"]
 41:  472| [45] [Watase grabbed Jun by the wrist.]
 42:  498| [47] [Jun]
 43:  501| [45] ["Hey! 'the hell you doing, you perv!?"]
 44:  509| [47] [Watase]
 45:  512| [45] ["Shut up! Keep it down for a minute!"]
 46:  610| [45] [Jun complied, and Watase examined her Vital Checker.]
 47:  615| [45] [Normally, all five lights would be green, but this time-- one of them was bright red.]
 48:  623| [47] [Watase]
 49:  626| [45] ["It's red! That means there's something wrong with your body, right!?"]
 50:  652| [47] [Jun]
 51:  655| [45] ["Whoa, hold your horses, that's just the 'pulse' indicator, right?"]
 52:  663| [47] [Jun]
 53:  666| [45] ["My heart's just racing a bit 'cause I just got done blowing chunks all over the floor... it'll be green again soon. See?"]
 54:  711| [45] [The light turned green again shortly after Jun said that.]
 55:  739| [47] [Jun]
 56:  742| [45] ["See, I'm all better now. Right as rain."]
 57:  750| [47] [Watase]
 58:  753| [45] ["I see... well, okay then..."]
 59:  779| [47] [Jun]
 60:  782| [45] ["But hey, are -you- okay? You having another headache?"]
 61:  790| [47] [Watase]
 62:  793| [45] ["Huh? Oh... no, I'm all good."]
 63:  798| [45] [He then realized something.]
 64:  803| [45] [The strange feeling he'd felt when he'd entered the contaminated zone had vanished.]
 65:  808| [47] [Watase]
 66:  809| [45] [(So it really was the effects of the radiation...)]
 67:  814| [45] [But that's why Watase was worried.]
 68:  819| [45] [Like him, Jun had also been in a contaminated zone twice.]
 69:  824| [45] [Watase was stronger than her and even he'd fainted. Meaning there was no guarantee someone with such a small body like Jun's would be okay.]
 70:  832| [47] [Watase]
 71:  835| [45] ["... Tell me right away if something comes up."]
 72:  861| [47] [Jun]
 73:  864| [45] ["Thanks for worrying about me. You really are acting so nice today."]
 74:  874| [47] [Watase]
 75:  877| [45] ["What're you talking about? It's only natural to be worried about your partner."]
 76:  886| [47] [Watase]
 77:  889| [45] ["What're you talking about, you idiot? It's only natural for a captain to worry about his subordinate."]
 78:  895| [45] [The two of them smiled at each other. Frail smiles, but smiles nonetheless.]
 79:  921| [47] [Jun]
 80:  924| [45] ["... Anyway, looks like we found quite the treasure back there, huh?"]
 81:  932| [47] [Watase]
 82:  935| [45] ["No kidding. It's too bad that we didn't find any survivors... but it sure is good we found the AD so quickly this time around!"]
 83:  940| [45] [With the five he'd found in the contaminated zone, Watase now had six AD on him.]
 84:  945| [45] [They still had plenty of time left until the next injection, so they could take it easy for a while.]
 85:  971| [47] [Jun]
 86:  974| [45] ["All right! Then let's regroup with the others! I'm sure they'll be as happy as we are!"]
 87:  982| [47] [Watase]
 88:  985| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 89:  990| [45] [Watase and Jun then ran off together.]
 90: 1082| [45] [They headed for a large room in the outer ring-- Kazami and the others were already there to greet them.]
 91: 1159| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1162| [45] ["Oh? That was rather quick."]
 93: 1190| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1193| [45] ["You're done searching the inner ring?"]
 95: 1201| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1204| [45] ["Yeah. And guess what we found..."]
 97: 1230| [47] [Jun]
 98: 1233| [45] ["More AD!"]
 99: 1238| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at once.]
100: 1264| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1267| [45] ["How many did you find...?"]
102: 1275| [47] [Watase]
103: 1278| [45] ["Five. Now we have six altogether."]
104: 1304| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1307| [45] ["This is wonderful! It's a good thing you found them quickly this time."]
106: 1426| [47] [Ena]
107: 1429| [45] ["So there -was- a lot of AD stored in Area 5! It's just like the disaster prevention manual said!"]
108: 1437| [47] [Ukita]
109: 1440| [45] ["Indeed. Now we can rest easy."]
110: 1445| [45] [--They chose to keep the fact that the inner ring was contaminated a secret.]
111: 1450| [45] [With their search of it over, they didn't need to give the rest of the group any unnecessary worry.]
112: 1559| [47] [Watase]
113: 1562| [45] ["By the way, how about you guys?"]
114: 1570| [47] [Jun]
115: 1573| [45] ["Find anything?"]
116: 1611| [45] [The rest of the group's faces dimmed slightly.]
117: 1637| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1640| [45] ["No, nothing on our end... no AD and no survivors."]
119: 1666| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1669| [45] ["However, we did come across these..."]
121: 1674| [45] [Ukita held out a bunch of security cards, all labeled "Lv6".]
122: 1682| [47] [Watase]
123: 1685| [45] ["You found that many Level 6 cards?"]
124: 1711| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1714| [45] ["We found those three in the same room. It appears they belong to the person who manages and creates these cards."]
126: 1740| [47] [Ukita]
127: 1743| [45] ["Or perhaps they belong to facility inspectors..."]
128: 1748| [45] [Either way, they now had four Level 6 cards.]
129: 1753| [45] [But there wasn't much use in having so many cards of the same level.]
130: 1779| [47] [Ena]
131: 1782| [45] ["... The cards don't matter. The survivors are much more important."]
132: 1845| [45] [They headed for a large room in the outer ring-- Kazami and the others were already there to greet them.]
133: 1922| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1925| [45] ["Oh? That was rather quick."]
135: 1953| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1956| [45] ["You're done searching the inner ring?"]
137: 1964| [47] [Watase]
138: 1967| [45] ["Yeah... but we didn't really find anything..."]
139: 1993| [47] [Kazami]
140: 1996| [45] ["I see..."]
141: 2022| [47] [Watase]
142: 2025| [45] ["By the way, how about you guys?"]
143: 2033| [47] [Jun]
144: 2036| [45] ["Find anything?"]
145: 2044| [47] [Kazami]
146: 2047| [45] ["No, nothing on our end either... no AD and no survivors."]
147: 2073| [47] [Ukita]
148: 2076| [45] ["However, we did come across these..."]
149: 2081| [45] [Ukita held out a bunch of security cards, all labeled "Lv6".]
150: 2089| [47] [Watase]
151: 2092| [45] ["You found that many Level 6 cards?"]
152: 2118| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2121| [45] ["We found those three in the same room. It appears they belong to the person who manages and creates these cards."]
154: 2147| [47] [Ukita]
155: 2150| [45] ["Or perhaps they belong to facility inspectors..."]
156: 2155| [45] [Either way, they now had four Level 6 cards.]
157: 2160| [45] [But there wasn't much use in having so many cards of the same level.]
158: 2168| [47] [Watase]
159: 2171| [45] ["... Still, I wish we'd found some AD instead..."]
160: 2176| [45] [There were about 30 minutes to go until it was time for their next AD injection--%Nso they had to find more before then.]
161: 2181| [45] [But that wasn't the only problem they had, as Ena's depressed comment reminded them.]
162: 2207| [47] [Ena]
163: 2210| [45] ["And the survivors are important too..."]
164: 2218| [47] [Ena]
165: 2221| [45] ["I wonder why we can't find any of them. Area 6 is the only place we haven't searched yet, right?"]
166: 2229| [47] [Watase]
167: 2232| [45] ["Yeah... It really is... kinda strange that we still haven't found them."]
168: 2387| [45] [They'd already finished searching over 80%% of the facility.]
169: 2392| [45] [Meaning the survivors were either somewhere the group didn't know, or were already dead.]
170: 2397| [47] [Watase]
171: 2398| [45] [(Is there any place we overlooked? Are their bodies there...?)]
172: 2403| [45] [The air grew heavily still as if Watase's sentiments had spread to everyone else.]
173: 2410| [45] [But-- a timid voice rose as if to cut through all that.]
174: 2473| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 2476| [45] ["U-Um... I think it'd be better... if we think positively instead."]
176: 2484| [47] [Watase]
177: 2487| [45] ["Huh?"]
178: 2495| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 2498| [45] ["Wouldn't it be best to believe that the fact we haven't seen them yet... means that everyone's still alive?"]
180: 2506| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2509| [45] ["... I'm sure they're all in Area 6."]
182: 2514| [45] [Watase was astonished at the longest declaration he'd ever heard Yuuri speak.]
183: 2519| [45] [But something gradually crept out of the depths of his stomach.]
184: 2527| [47] [Watase]
185: 2530| [45] ["... You're right."]
186: 2557| [47] [Kazami]
187: 2560| [45] ["... Indeed."]
188: 2588| [47] [Jun]
189: 2591| [45] ["Yep, Yuuri's absolutely right!"]
190: 2617| [47] [Yuuri]
191: 2620| [45] ["See...?"]
192: 2625| [45] [Yuuri's peaceful smile dispelled the shadows shrouding everyone's faces.]
193: 2651| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2654| [45] ["Indeed... Thinking dark thoughts all the time won't do any good."]
195: 2680| [47] [Ena]
196: 2683| [45] ["That's right. Ms. Sannomiya and all the others are strong kids."]
197: 2691| [47] [Watase]
198: 2694| [45] ["All right...! Then let's continue with the search, people!"]
199: 2720| [47] [Kazami]
200: 2723| [45] ["Yes. Even if they haven't escaped, we should definitely find them in Area 6."]
201: 2728| [45] [The group all nodded at each other and started walking off.]
202: 2733| [45] [Their final destination was "Area 6", where all of their hopes lay--!]
203: 2797| [47] [Kazami]
204: 2800| [45] ["... At any rate, we're done searching Area 5."]
205: 2808| [47] [Kazami]
206: 2811| [45] ["Let's move on to Area 6..."]
207: 2816| [45] [The group nodded gravely at those words.]
