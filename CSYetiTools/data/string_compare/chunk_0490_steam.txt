  0:   65| [45] [--One day, about half a year after Kazami had joined Sirius--]
  1:   70| [45] [She found her mind twisting and turning over a certain question.]
  2:  136| [47] [Kazami]
  3:  137| [45] [(What was the meaning of that...!?)]
  4:  142| [45] [That thought had been racing through Kazami's head as she and the rest of Team A jogged as a part of their daily morning routine.]
  5:  147| [45] [The night before, Watase had taken her to a classical music concert with him.]
  6:  152| [45] [She'd never been to one before.]
  7:  201| [45] [So Kazami had spent the whole night before that studying up on classical music so she'd be able to hold an actual conversation with Watase on the subject.]
  8:  206| [45] [Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel, Bach, Dvorak--]
  9:  211| [45] [Major and Minor keys, the structure of a fugue, counterpoints, the history of music, the lives of musicians, musical interpretation...]
 10:  216| [45] [She'd also gone and bought a dress for the occasion the morning of the concert, and had also gone to the beauty parlor.]
 11:  265| [45] [And then the big night finally came.]
 12:  270| [45] [Kazami sat next to Watase and listened to the NDK Symphony--]
 13:  275| [45] [At least until she'd fallen into a peaceful slumber at some point.]
 14:  280| [45] [... When she woke up, Watase was holding her hand.]
 15:  285| [45] [She likely would never forget the surprise she felt at that moment for as long as she lived.]
 16:  290| [45] [But the concert ended right after that, and Watase had let go so he could applaud.]
 17:  295| [45] [In the end, she never figured out why he'd done that...]
 18:  349| [45] [Kazami could still feel the warmth of Watase's hand in her palm at that very moment.]
 19:  354| [45] [Her heart pounded like crazy every time she remembered it.]
 20:  359| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  360| [45] [(Could the Captain feel the same way as...!)]
 22:  365| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  366| [45] [(No, that couldn't be it... He went back home right after we had dinner last night, after all...)]
 24:  371| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  372| [45] [(But perhaps that was his way of showing kindness to me since he knew I was tired...!)]
 26:  377| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  378| [45] [(No, maybe I'm just interpreting things the way I wish they were...)]
 28:  383| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  384| [45] [(But-- then why did the Captain hold my hand...!?)]
 30:  389| [45] [Her feelings kept fluctuating like mad as she ran around the fire station.]
 31:  422| [47] [Watase]
 32:  425| [45] ["... What are you doing, Tachibana? You're a lap behind, aren't you?"]
 33:  451| [47] [Watase]
 34:  454| [45] ["Hey, quit spacing out. Run with your eyes forward, not down."]
 35:  459| [45] [Someone was telling her she was falling behind.]
 36:  464| [45] [But Kazami was in no state to care about any of that.]
 37:  469| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  470| [45] [(Oh no, what's gotten into me? I'm supposed to be training. This isn't the time to be thinking about--)]
 39:  496| [47] [Watase]
 40:  499| [45] ["Hey, Tachibana. There's a car coming up from behind."]
 41:  504| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  505| [45] [(B-but... if the Captain really does l-like me, then...!)]
 43:  531| [47] [Watase]
 44:  534| [45] ["Hey, that car's gonna run right into you. Where are you even looking?"]
 45:  539| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  540| [45] [(I'm... I'm so happy... so much so that I just want to--!)]
 47:  567| [47] [Watase]
 48:  570| [45] ["D-dumbass! You're running right into the street!"]
 49:  575| [47] [Kazami]
 50:  578| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 51:  601| [45] [Someone suddenly tugged Kazami's arm.]
 52:  653| [45] [It happened so suddenly that she lost her balance and fell.]
 53:  658| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  661| [45] ["Ahh!"]
 55:  725| [47] [Watase]
 56:  728| [45] ["Uwah!"]
 57:  739| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  742| [45] ["Huh... what...?"]
 59:  747| [45] [When she opened her eyes, Watase was right in front of her.]
 60:  752| [45] [He was pushing her against the sidewalk.]
 61:  757| [45] [There was barely any distance between them.]
 62:  783| [47] [Watase]
 63:  786| [45] ["What the hell were you thinking!? You got a death wish!?"]
 64:  791| [45] [Kazami didn't understand what had happened.]
 65:  796| [45] [All she -did- know was that Watase was in front of her.]
 66:  801| [45] [--At that moment, something within Kazami just seemed to burst.]
 67:  806| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  809| [45] ["Um, Captain..."]
 69:  835| [47] [Watase]
 70:  838| [45] ["What now?"]
 71:  843| [47] [Kazami]
 72:  846| [45] ["I... love you."]
 73:  872| [47] [Watase]
 74:  875| [45] ["... Wait, what?"]
 75:  880| [45] [Watase's eyes widened.]
 76:  885| [45] [It was the first confession Kazami had made in her life.]
 77:  917| [47] [Watase]
 78:  920| [45] ["Di... did you just..."]
 79:  925| [45] [Hearing that trembling voice abruptly brought Kazami back to her senses.]
 80:  930| [45] [When she did, she grew incredibly embarrassed of what she'd just said-- of her confession that lacked any regard for timing or anything...]
 81:  935| [47] [Kazami]
 82:  938| [45] ["C-Captain...!"]
 83:  964| [47] [Watase]
 84:  967| [45] ["Y-yes?"]
 85:  972| [47] [Kazami]
 86:  975| [45] ["Y-you didn't happen to hear what I just said, did you!?"]
 87: 1001| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1004| [45] ["N-no! I heard nothing, I swear!"]
 89: 1009| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1012| [45] ["You -did- hear it, didn't you!?"]
 91: 1020| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1023| [45] ["No I didn't!"]
 93: 1028| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1031| [45] ["Y-you've got it all wrong! I just got a little lost in the moment, that's all!"]
 95: 1057| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1060| [45] ["Hey, hold on! Lost in the moment of what!? Who the hell confesses their love in the middle of training!?"]
 97: 1065| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1068| [45] ["AAAAAAAH! So you DID hear me! Please forget all about it!"]
 99: 1094| [47] [Watase]
100: 1097| [45] ["How do you expect me to do that!?"]
101: 1181| [45] [Their rather childish argument echoed all around them.]
102: 1187| [45] [A refreshing autumn breeze blew through the sky.]
