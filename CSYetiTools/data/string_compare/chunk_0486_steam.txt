  0:   65| [45] [Kazami and the others continued the search after they found Dojima's body.]
  1:   70| [45] [But just one hour later--]
  2:  129| [45] [They were faced with the death of yet another one of their coworkers.]
  3:  165| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  168| [45] ["No... no..."]
  5:  173| [47] [Jun]
  6:  176| [45] ["Hiyama, not you too...!"]
  7:  181| [45] [--It appeared that Hiyama had burned to death after both his legs had been broken.]
  8:  186| [45] [Kazami and Jun weren't alone: Ena, Ukita, and Yuuri were also all incredibly shaken up by that sight.]
  9:  272| [45] [--Kazami stuck to her firm attitude in order to calm the others down.]
 10:  277| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  280| [45] ["... Dying in the line of duty is an unavoidable risk in this line of work."]
 12:  306| [47] [Watase]
 13:  309| [45] ["But Tachibana..."]
 14:  314| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  317| [45] ["Please don't say anything, Captain."]
 16:  322| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  325| [45] ["We can save our grief for after we've rescued the survivors and gotten outside."]
 18:  330| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  333| [45] ["You have to do the same, Moribe..."]
 20:  338| [45] [Once Kazami had said that, Jun was the next to tearfully speak.]
 21:  416| [47] [Jun]
 22:  419| [45] ["But... today was the first time... I've ever lost a coworker on the job..."]
 23:  445| [47] [Jun]
 24:  448| [45] ["And now... it's happened... again..."]
 25:  453| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  456| [45] ["I know. But you have to hold your head high. You discarded your womanhood when you joined Sirius. Remember that."]
 27:  482| [47] [Jun]
 28:  485| [45] ["But... Sis...!"]
 29:  490| [45] [Jun choked back a sob.]
 30:  523| [45] [Kazami didn't scold her for calling her "Sis".]
 31:  528| [45] [It took everything she had to hold back the tumult of emotions raging in her heart.]
 32:  533| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  534| [45] [(I have to endure it... I have to lead everyone...!)]
 34:  539| [45] [But just as Kazami thought that-- Watase spoke up.]
 35:  572| [47] [Watase]
 36:  575| [45] ["Tachibana, Moribe... can I have a minute?"]
 37:  580| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  583| [45] ["Huh?"]
 39:  609| [47] [Watase]
 40:  612| [45] ["We're changing leaders. I'll lead the group from this point onwards."]
 41:  645| [47] [Jun]
 42:  648| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 43:  696| [47] [Watase]
 44:  699| [45] ["Oh come on, I'm just restoring the status quo, that's all."]
 45:  725| [47] [Watase]
 46:  728| [45] ["Anyway, just rely on me for a while. Especially you, Tachibana-- you've been carrying far too heavy a burden up until now."]
 47:  733| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  734| [45] ["..."]
 49:  739| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase.]
 50:  744| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  745| [45] [(No way, but... I have to...! I'm the leader right now! That's my responsibility!)]
 52:  750| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  751| [45] [(There's no way I can entrust all that to the hands of someone who's lost his memories...!)]
 54:  756| [45] [But Watase beat Kazami to the punch before she could say anything.]
 55:  783| [47] [Watase]
 56:  786| [45] ["Didn't you hear me? Then let me make it an order-- as Sirius' captain."]
 57:  812| [47] [Watase]
 58:  815| [45] ["As of this point onwards, Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana and Ensign Jun Moribe will hereby defer to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command!"]
 59:  862| [47] [Kazami & Jun]
 60:  865| [45] ["!!"]
 61:  870| [45] [Kazami shuddered at those words.]
 62:  875| [45] [His voice, the look on his face-- they were that of the usual Watase.]
 63:  901| [47] [Watase]
 64:  904| [45] ["Now let me hear you say it!"]
 65:  909| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  912| [45] ["Sir! Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana deferring to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command, sir!"]
 67:  938| [47] [Jun]
 68:  941| [45] ["E-Ensign Jun Moribe deferring to Captain's command, sir!"]
 69:  967| [47] [Watase]
 70:  970| [45] ["Good!"]
 71:  975| [45] [Watase then smiled and patted Kazami on the shoulder.]
 72: 1001| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1004| [45] ["... And there you have it. Well, that was mainly for formality's sake-- I'm still counting on you both to basically keep things running the way they've been so far."]
 74: 1009| [45] [He was probably saying that in the friendliest voice he could muster in an attempt to relieve their tension.]
 75: 1014| [45] [But Kazami was happy about that consideration.]
 76: 1019| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1022| [45] ["Y-yes... please."]
 78: 1027| [45] [Jun then followed up as if to support Kazami's opinion.]
 79: 1053| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1056| [45] ["You're right... we can't keep staying down in the dumps forever."]
 81: 1064| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1067| [45] ["The fires are out and we've got a card, so now we can now go all the way to Area 6.%NWe have nothing to fear!"]
 83: 1093| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1096| [45] ["Yeah, that's the spirit!"]
 85: 1101| [45] [Watase gave a satisfied smile.]
 86: 1106| [45] [Kazami gently touched his shoulder--]
 87: 1111| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1114| [45] ["... Thank you so much, Captain."]
 89: 1119| [45] [And smiled back.]
 90: 1226| [45] [The group then moved on and searched Areas 5 and 6.]
 91: 1287| [45] [At one point, the factory's ceiling collapsed, trapping Watase and Yuuri under debris--]
 92: 1293| [45] [But thanks to Watase's quick decisions and his well-toned body, Yuuri was saved without a scratch.]
 93: 1298| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1299| [45] [(Thank goodness... thank goodness...)]
 95: 1353| [45] [Watase then discovered there was a way to open the door to the cargo lift-- the one potentially good escape route they had.]
 96: 1364| [45] [Using the nearby crane, they were successful in opening the cargo lift door.]
 97: 1369| [45] [They had yet to find the survivors, but still--]
 98: 1375| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1376| [45] [(The six of us here can all escape in one piece, at the very least...)]
100: 1381| [45] [Kazami was grateful to Watase from the bottom of her heart for that.]
101: 1491| [45] [She walked up to him and spoke gently.]
102: 1496| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1499| [45] ["Captain..."]
104: 1507| [47] [Watase]
105: 1510| [45] ["Hmm? What is it?"]
106: 1515| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1518| [45] ["... I'm so glad."]
108: 1523| [47] [Kazami]
109: 1526| [45] ["It's like you're your old self again..."]
110: 1552| [47] [Watase]
111: 1555| [45] ["You mean my usual self?"]
112: 1560| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1563| [45] ["No, not that. I meant that... it felt like you were the way you used to be back when I first enlisted."]
114: 1589| [47] [Watase]
115: 1592| [45] ["Huh...? So you mean even before I lost my memories today, I'd already been acting different from how I was when you enlisted?"]
116: 1597| [47] [Kazami]
117: 1600| [45] ["Ah, no, I don't mean you were all that different, it's just that you've been keeping to yourself more than usual recently."]
118: 1626| [47] [Watase]
119: 1629| [45] ["Then you're saying there's three of me?"]
120: 1637| [47] [Watase]
121: 1640| [45] ["The 'current' me, the 'normal' me, and the me 'when you just enlisted'. Is that right?"]
122: 1645| [47] [Kazami]
123: 1648| [45] ["Yes, that would be the case."]
124: 1674| [47] [Watase]
125: 1677| [45] ["Hahah, man, I don't sound like a very clear-cut person, do I? Wonder which one's the real me."]
126: 1682| [47] [Kazami]
127: 1685| [45] ["I'm sure all of them are."]
128: 1690| [47] [Kazami]
129: 1693| [45] ["The kind you, the you who works his hardest, the cold and collected you-- all of those are a part of you."]
130: 1719| [47] [Watase]
131: 1722| [45] ["I see. Maybe you're right."]
132: 1748| [47] [Watase]
133: 1751| [45] ["One more question then. Out of all the me's I've been, which do you like the best?"]
134: 1756| [47] [Kazami]
135: 1759| [45] ["That's--..."]
136: 1764| [45] [Kazami swallowed her answer.]
137: 1769| [45] [After all the years she'd spent with Watase, and with the last few hours they'd spent struggling to survive together, Kazami had come to an epiphany of sorts.]
138: 1774| [45] [People change with time. Watase himself had changed a bit from the day she'd met him.]
139: 1779| [45] [But after taking into account those changes, the ever-changing present, as well as the past and the future, she knew--]
140: 1784| [47] [Kazami]
141: 1785| [45] [(... I love this man.)]
142: 1790| [47] [Kazami]
143: 1791| [45] [(The powerless yet brave Watase, the calm and efficient Watase, the kind and gentle Watase... I love all of them.)]
144: 1796| [45] [A warmth filled Kazami's heart.]
145: 1801| [45] [But it was something that was best left unsaid for now. So Kazami instead smiled and answered Watase.]
146: 1806| [47] [Kazami]
147: 1809| [45] ["... Right now, I like you as you are."]
148: 1835| [47] [Watase]
149: 1838| [45] ["Huh?"]
150: 1843| [47] [Kazami]
151: 1846| [45] ["No matter how much you change, I'll always like the man you -are- more than any memory of who you've -been-."]
152: 1872| [47] [Watase]
153: 1875| [45] ["..."]
154: 1898| [45] [Watase gave an embarrassed smile.]
155: 1903| [45] [That was the first time Kazami had ever seen such a boyish expression on his face in the many years she'd known him.]
156: 2123| [45] [--As I go back through that memory--]
157: 2128| [45] [Kazami's feelings for Watase grow even further in her mind.]
158: 2133| [45] [And alongside that growth...]
159: 2138| [45] [Another memory that Kazami had sealed away out of embarrassment rises up from the deepest depths of her mind.]
