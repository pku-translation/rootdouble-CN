  1:   23| [45] [Only one road led to LABO.]
  2:   28| [45] ["LABO Private Highway". The entrance had an inspection gate where all cars were checked.]
  3:   33| [45] [The facility was equipped with a nuclear reactor. That level of security was only to be expected.]
  4:   71| [45] [And at the entrance--]
  5:   76| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu were caught in the checkpoint as well.]
  6:  120| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
  7:  123| [45] ["Mm!? Who are you kids!?"]
  8:  128| [45] [They were stopped by a stern-faced traffic inspector.]
  9:  136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  139| [45] ["We want to go to LABO! Please let us through!"]
 11:  144| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 12:  147| [45] ["What the hell do you think you're saying? No. Definitely not."]
 13:  152| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 14:  155| [45] ["How do you even expect to get there? It's 10 km away, you know?"]
 15:  160| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 16:  163| [45] ["Stop spewing bullshit and go home, kids."]
 17:  196| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  199| [45] ["B-but we know Dr. Tenkawa..."]
 19:  204| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 20:  207| [45] ["I don't care who you know. Nobody gets through this inspection gate without a valid reason."]
 21:  212| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 22:  215| [45] ["If you want to get to LABO, then go through the proper routes to get permission from the Rokumei City Security Department or LABO's PR manager."]
 23:  223| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  226| [45] ["Permission? How long does it take to get that?"]
 25:  231| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 26:  234| [45] ["Anywhere from three days to one week, I suppose."]
 27:  239| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 28:  242| [45] ["Though I seriously doubt they'd take an ordinary student's application seriously."]
 29:  268| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  271| [45] ["N-no way...!"]
 31:  279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  282| [45] ["There could be a terrorist attack on LABO, you know!?"]
 33:  287| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 34:  290| [45] ["A terrorist attack? Well yeah, there's been a big commotion lately around town."]
 35:  295| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 36:  298| [45] ["We're already on guard. A little too on guard if you ask me, though."]
 37:  324| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  327| [45] ["No! It's not enough!"]
 39:  360| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  363| [45] ["There's a high probability that the terrorists could have a sleeper agent in LABO.%NHave you considered that possibility?"]
 41:  368| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 42:  371| [45] ["Sleeper agent? What nonsense is that?"]
 43:  376| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 44:  379| [45] ["Whatever, just go home already before I call the cops on you."]
 45:  384| [45] [And with that threat, the traffic inspector placed his hand on the phone.]
 46:  389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  390| [45] [(The police...!)]
 48:  395| [45] [They had just cleared their names with the security department. If he called the police, things could quite possibly get troublesome again.]
 49:  400| [45] [Salyu gently whispered into Natsuhiko's ear.]
 50:  426| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  429| [45] ["Let's go home, you two. It's not a good idea to agitate the situation any further."]
 52:  455| [47] [Mashiro]
 53:  458| [45] ["B-but...!"]
 54:  466| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  469| [45] ["What we need to do is stop the terrorist plot. Not make enemies of the police and security department."]
 56:  477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  480| [45] ["...!"]
 58:  485| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro were finally convinced.]
 59:  493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  496| [45] ["... Okay. Let's think of a new plan, then."]
 61:  522| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  525| [45] ["It'd be for the best."]
 63:  551| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  554| [45] ["... Excuse us."]
 65:  559| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 66:  562| [45] ["Hmph. Better not see you here again even if you get lost, you hear?"]
 67:  610| [45] [The kids left the inspection point with that voice at their backs.]
 68:  636| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  639| [45] ["This looks bad... What do we do?"]
 70:  647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  650| [45] ["Doesn't look like we've got a choice... Let's look for a pay phone for now."]
 72:  658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  661| [45] ["Let's give a heads up to the police and the security department, and finally LABO."]
 74:  666| [45] [They nodded and began walking again.]
 75:  716| [45] [--As they walked about the main road, they soon found two pay phones lined up next to each other.]
 76:  721| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly looked up the security department number and called them.]
 77:  743| [47] [Security Dept.]
 78:  746| [45] ["Yes, this is the Rokumei Municipal Office Security Department, Takehashi speaking."]
 79:  754| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  757| [45] ["Thanks for all the hard work. It's me, Tenkawa, the Rokumei Academy student."]
 81:  762| [47] [Security Dept.]
 82:  765| [45] ["... Oh, well if it isn't Mr. Housekeeper. What can I do for you?"]
 83:  773| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84:  776| [45] ["Well, you see..."]
 85:  781| [45] [Natsuhiko gave the security department member a summary of Salyu's conjecture.]
 86:  786| [45] [However--]
 87:  794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88:  797| [45] ["So basically, there's a possibility that the terrorists are targeting LABO..."]
 89:  802| [47] [Security Dept.]
 90:  805| [45] ["Yeah, we already know that. Thanks for your cooperation."]
 91:  810| [45] [The voice on the other side of the phone had not a hint of seriousness.]
 92:  815| [47] [Security Dept.]
 93:  818| [45] ["We'll give LABO a heads up, so just relax."]
 94:  826| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95:  829| [45] ["No, that still doesn't seem like enough... Can't you increase security or anything?"]
 96:  834| [47] [Security Dept.]
 97:  837| [45] ["Well, we'd have to dilute security at every other facility, and we can't exactly do that."]
 98:  845| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99:  848| [45] ["I know that, but isn't there anything you can do...?"]
100:  853| [47] [Security Dept.]
101:  856| [45] ["We can't work on possibilities alone. It'd be a different story if LABO at least received objectionable literature or something."]
102:  861| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103:  862| [45] ["..."]
104:  867| [47] [Security Dept.]
105:  870| [45] ["Anyway, we'll strengthen security around the city."]
106:  878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107:  881| [45] ["Understood... Please do..."]
108:  930| [45] [Natsuhiko drooped his shoulders and hung up.]
109:  992| [47] [Mashiro]
110:  995| [45] ["How did it go?"]
111: 1003| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1006| [45] ["Well, at least he heard me out, but you know... How'd it go on your end?"]
113: 1011| [45] [While Natsuhiko was calling the security department, Mashiro was contacting the police.]
114: 1016| [45] [But she just looked dejected and shook her head.]
115: 1042| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1045| [45] ["No good at all. They kept insisting that security was sufficient."]
117: 1053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1056| [45] ["Is our story too much of a stretch to get them to believe us...!?"]
119: 1083| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1086| [45] ["... What should we do?"]
121: 1092| [45] [Right when Salyu muttered that--]
122: 1097| [45] [They heard footsteps approaching in the distance.]
