  0:   60| [45] [Yuuri's life turned upside down after that.]
  1:   65| [45] [LABO became her new residence and her lifestyle now revolved around experiments.]
  2:   94| [45] [In one of LABO's laboratories, the professor gazed at Yuuri and spoke.]
  3:  120| [47] [Miyoko]
  4:  123| [45] ["--Ready, Yuuri?"]
  5:  131| [47] [Miyoko]
  6:  134| [45] ["We need you to undergo training from now on to develop your BC ability."]
  7:  142| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  145| [45] ["O... okay."]
  9:  153| [47] [Miyoko]
 10:  156| [45] ["You've already learned telepathy and empathy."]
 11:  164| [47] [Miyoko]
 12:  167| [45] ["So I want you to acquire the next ability."]
 13:  175| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  178| [45] ["The next ability...? You mean there's another ability besides telepathy and empathy?"]
 15:  204| [47] [Miyoko]
 16:  207| [45] ["It's been kept secret from the general public, you see. But there is a third ability that allows one to connect minds rather than just brains."]
 17:  216| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  219| [45] ["And the name of that ability... is 'Senses Sympathy'."]
 19:  227| [47] [Miyoko]
 20:  230| [45] ["A miraculous power that only appears in Rank S Aptitude Communicators."]
 21:  238| [47] [Yuuri]
 22:  241| [45] ["C-can I do something as amazing as that...?"]
 23:  267| [47] [Miyoko]
 24:  270| [45] ["No need to be so nervous. You're not the only Type S Communicator in the world, after all--"]
 25:  278| [47] [Miyoko]
 26:  281| [45] ["--And the Senses Sympathy ability itself was discovered many years ago."]
 27:  289| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  292| [45] ["Data have already been collected on Communicator usage of the ability, and we've even compiled a training manual..."]
 29:  318| [47] [Miyoko]
 30:  321| [45] ["So if you keep practicing in accordance with that manual, you're guaranteed to learn how to use it."]
 31:  329| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  332| [45] ["I-I'll try my best."]
 33:  380| [45] [--And thus the training began.]
 34:  385| [45] [To prepare, they first began with a lecture about the relationship between BC particles and the brain...]
 35:  454| [47] [Miyoko]
 36:  457| [45] ["--Senses Sympathy is the ultimate form of BC."]
 37:  465| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  468| [45] ["But to understand how it works, first you need to learn about what are known as 'BC particles'."]
 39:  476| [47] [Yuuri]
 40:  479| [45] ["BC particles?"]
 41:  505| [47] [Miyoko]
 42:  508| [45] ["They're these elementary particles-- tiny specks invisible to the eye-- that transmit the thought information of living creatures, or basically their 'mind activity'."]
 43:  516| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  519| [45] ["Invisible specks... mind activity..."]
 45:  527| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  530| [45] ["Take a look at this monitor for me. I'll explain using this diagram."]
 47:  570| [45] [The professor operated her computer as she spoke.]
 48:  575| [45] [Upon which, the monitor began to display a diagram explaining the relationship between BC particles and the human mind.]
 49:  626| [47] [Miyoko]
 50:  629| [45] ["You see, every corner of the world is filled with these BC particles."]
 51:  637| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  640| [45] ["They're in your head and mine, as well as in the space between us and beyond."]
 53:  648| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  651| [45] ["There are actually many subtypes of these particles, too."]
 55:  698| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  701| [45] ["Normally, the only ones that exist are 'Wanderer particles', or 'W particles' for short. These particles contain no information whatsoever..."]
 57:  748| [47] [Miyoko]
 58:  751| [45] ["But when they come in contact with the human brain, they become loaded with the information energy fired off due to brain activity, transforming them into 'M particles'."]
 59:  759| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  762| [45] ["The M stands for 'Mind', as the mind's information is written on these 'Mind particles'."]
 61:  771| [47] [Miyoko]
 62:  774| [45] ["All these types of particles relate to BC and are thus generally referred to as BC particles."]
 63:  782| [47] [Miyoko]
 64:  785| [45] ["Incidentally, there are other types of BC particles such as 'WX particles' and 'b particles', but they don't relate to today's explanation, so we'll skip them for now."]
 65:  793| [47] [Yuuri]
 66:  796| [45] ["O-okay..."]
 67:  804| [47] [Miyoko]
 68:  807| [45] ["You see, normally, M particles can't leave the human brain--"]
 69:  903| [47] [Miyoko]
 70:  906| [45] ["--but when Communicators use BC, the M particle energy in their brains increases."]
 71:  953| [47] [Miyoko]
 72:  956| [45] ["They use the surrounding W particles in concert, transforming them into M particles--"]
 73: 1003| [47] [Miyoko]
 74: 1006| [45] ["This process propagates all the way to the target. This is the precise mechanism behind BC ability activation."]
 75: 1011| [45] [The professor's lecture was more detailed than what high school students learned in school-- but naturally Yuuri didn't understand.]
 76: 1047| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1050| [45] ["U-um, Professor... I'm sorry."]
 78: 1058| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1061| [45] ["All these M and W things... It's too hard to keep track of them all...!"]
 80: 1087| [47] [Miyoko]
 81: 1090| [45] ["Oh, my apologies. I'll try to explain with simpler terminology then."]
 82: 1116| [47] [Miyoko]
 83: 1119| [45] ["For our purposes, there should be no fundamental problems with simply referring to all of these particles as 'BC particles'."]
 84: 1127| [47] [Yuuri]
 85: 1130| [45] ["Ah, that seems easier to understand..."]
 86: 1156| [47] [Miyoko]
 87: 1159| [45] ["That's good. Then next I'll explain the relationship between BC particles and BC abilities."]
 88: 1185| [47] [Miyoko]
 89: 1188| [45] ["For example, when you use telepathy, BC particles transmit from your 'mind' to me."]
 90: 1196| [47] [Miyoko]
 91: 1199| [45] ["When you use empathy, it's the opposite. You receive BC particles transmitted from my 'mind'."]
 92: 1207| [47] [Miyoko]
 93: 1210| [45] ["But Senses Sympathy is an ability that uses BC particles as an intermediary--"]
 94: 1218| [47] [Miyoko]
 95: 1221| [45] ["--for continuous observation of the target's 'thought information' in its entirety."]
 96: 1229| [47] [Miyoko]
 97: 1232| [45] ["The sights the target sees. The sounds the target hears. Their thoughts. The esper feels all of the target's sensory information."]
 98: 1240| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1243| [45] ["Umm... so they feel all of that person's mind activity, then?"]
100: 1269| [47] [Miyoko]
101: 1272| [45] ["That's correct. In other words, your brain maintains a perfect connection with someone else's via BC particles."]
102: 1298| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1301| [45] ["That is, it's akin to linking two computers through a LAN connection."]
104: 1309| [47] [Miyoko]
105: 1312| [45] ["When that happens, your own senses vanish, and you observe the world through the target's senses instead."]
106: 1320| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1323| [45] ["Hmm... so is it like turning into a ghost and possessing someone...?"]
108: 1349| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1352| [45] ["I don't believe in ghosts, but it probably feels like something close to that."]
110: 1378| [47] [Miyoko]
111: 1381| [45] ["Do your best until you can pull off that ability. I'll be here for you the entire time."]
112: 1407| [47] [Miyoko]
113: 1410| [45] ["Let's begin. 'Senses Sympathy Trial Experiment' #1, Phase 1, Act."]
114: 1469| [45] [--And just as the professor had told her to, Yuuri partook in the experiments that day.]
115: 1474| [45] [And the next day, and the next day, and the day after that...]
116: 1558| [47] [Miyoko]
117: 1561| [45] ["--Okay, Yuuri. Let's try it one more time."]
118: 1587| [47] [Miyoko]
119: 1590| [45] ["'Senses Sympathy Trial Experiment' #1026, Phase 1, Act."]
120: 1598| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1601| [45] ["Okay! Here I go!"]
122: 1653| [45] [Yuuri focused with all her mind,]
123: 1658| [45] [and tried to connect it to the professor in front of her.]
124: 1663| [45] [And at that moment--]
125: 1860| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1861| [45] [(!!)]
127: 1884| [45] [Her vision swayed, and in an instant, what she saw completely changed.]
128: 1889| [45] [--She was looking at herself through the professor's point of view!]
129: 2002| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 2005| [45] ["P... Professor! I did it!"]
131: 2031| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 2034| [45] ["Huh?"]
133: 2042| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 2045| [45] ["I saw myself. That means it worked, right?"]
135: 2106| [47] [Miyoko]
136: 2109| [45] ["...!"]
137: 2114| [45] [The professor's eyes widened.]
138: 2119| [45] [But her surprise soon changed into a smile.]
139: 2145| [47] [Miyoko]
140: 2148| [45] ["Th-that's amazing, Yuuri! I can't believe you've gotten this far in just a month!"]
141: 2156| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 2159| [45] ["I-is that good?"]
143: 2167| [47] [Miyoko]
144: 2170| [45] ["It's better than good! You're a genius!"]
145: 2195| [45] [The professor hugged Yuuri.]
146: 2200| [45] [Wrapped in the warmth of those arms, Yuuri smiled in relief.]
147: 2250| [45] [--The professor was always kind to Yuuri and spent much time with her, both in and out of experiments.]
148: 2255| [45] [And perhaps as a result, Yuuri gradually eased into her new life.]
149: 2260| [45] [After that success, the experiments continued further.]
150: 2329| [47] [Miyoko]
151: 2332| [45] ["--The Senses Sympathy ability you acquired yesterday is BC in its true form."]
152: 2340| [47] [Miyoko]
153: 2343| [45] ["The truth is that both telepathy and empathy are but mere immature forms of that ability..."]
154: 2351| [47] [Miyoko]
155: 2354| [45] ["Senses Sympathy uses BC particles as an intermediary to place the target's mind completely under the surveillance of the esper."]
156: 2362| [47] [Miyoko]
157: 2365| [45] ["Allow me to explain exactly how the underlying mechanism works."]
158: 2381| [45] [The professor operated the computer as she spoke.]
159: 2392| [45] [Upon which, the monitor displayed the same diagram she previously used to explain the mechanism of BC.]
160: 2444| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 2447| [45] ["All information involved in brain activity undergoes constant mutual interaction with the intracerebral BC particles, that is, the ones inside the brain."]
162: 2494| [47] [Miyoko]
163: 2497| [45] ["All thoughts and information perceived through the senses are copied onto the intracerebral BC particles."]
164: 2633| [47] [Miyoko]
165: 2636| [45] ["Conversely, the information on the intracerebral BC particles has a constant effect on the brain. This is the relationship between the 'brain' and the 'intracerebral BC particles'."]
166: 2683| [47] [Miyoko]
167: 2686| [45] ["This relationship enables the user of the Senses Sympathy ability--"]
168: 2733| [47] [Miyoko]
169: 2736| [45] ["--to perceive all of the information on the target's intracerebral BC particles."]
170: 2744| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2747| [45] ["So it's like a powered up empathy?"]
172: 2755| [47] [Miyoko]
173: 2758| [45] ["That's roughly correct."]
174: 2766| [47] [Miyoko]
175: 2769| [45] ["Normal empathy is unusable if the target's heart isn't opened up to the esper, but that hurdle can be cleared."]
176: 2816| [47] [Miyoko]
177: 2819| [45] ["The noise heard during empathy is thought to be a self-defense mechanism provided by the brain."]
178: 2866| [47] [Miyoko]
179: 2869| [45] ["But complete sympathy of the senses apparently bypasses that defense."]
180: 2877| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2880| [45] ["So you mean it allows you to read anyone's mind, then?"]
182: 2888| [47] [Miyoko]
183: 2891| [45] ["Indeed. But that's not the only distinction Senses Sympathy has from empathy."]
184: 2899| [47] [Miyoko]
185: 2902| [45] ["One key difference is that you aren't limited to simply perceiving the information the target is 'currently perceiving'..."]
186: 2949| [47] [Miyoko]
187: 2952| [45] ["But you can go also go back and perceive their 'past memories' as well."]
188: 2960| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2963| [45] ["Huh? Their memories too?"]
190: 2971| [47] [Miyoko]
191: 2974| [45] ["Indeed. Memories are just another form of intracerebral information."]
192: 3021| [47] [Miyoko]
193: 3024| [45] ["By merely wishing to know the target's past, the esper can see each and every one of the target's memories."]
194: 3032| [47] [Miyoko]
195: 3035| [45] ["Furthermore--"]
196: 3082| [47] [Miyoko]
197: 3085| [45] ["The esper can even transmit intracerebral information of their own to the target."]
198: 3093| [47] [Miyoko]
199: 3096| [45] ["The intense information energy released by the esper propagates all the way to the target's intracerebral BC particles--"]
200: 3143| [47] [Miyoko]
201: 3146| [45] ["And those BC particles in turn cause the target's brain to change accordingly, giving rise to false sensory information."]
202: 3154| [47] [Miyoko]
203: 3157| [45] ["And it's not limited to auditory information. The esper can create hallucinations in all the senses, including sight, smell, taste, and touch."]
204: 3165| [47] [Yuuri]
205: 3168| [45] ["So is that part like powered up telepathy...?"]
206: 3176| [47] [Miyoko]
207: 3179| [45] ["Correct. Except the esper isn't limited to just auditory hallucinations, but visual hallucinations among other things as well."]
208: 3187| [47] [Miyoko]
209: 3190| [45] ["And of course, the hallucinations aren't limited to just the 'current sensory information', either."]
210: 3286| [47] [Miyoko]
211: 3289| [45] ["It's possible to create hallucinations in the target's 'past memories' as well."]
212: 3297| [47] [Miyoko]
213: 3300| [45] ["And that is the entirety of the ability known as Senses Sympathy. Any questions?"]
214: 3336| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 3339| [45] ["I see~ I understand how it's an amazing ability."]
216: 3347| [47] [Miyoko]
217: 3350| [45] ["Yes... it is quite the tremendous ability indeed."]
218: 3376| [47] [Miyoko]
219: 3379| [45] ["Yuuri. Do you realize just what unspeakable horrors are possible by combining those two aspects of this ability?"]
220: 3387| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 3390| [45] ["Huh?"]
222: 3398| [47] [Miyoko]
223: 3401| [45] ["By peeking into the target's memories and creating hallucinations within them--"]
224: 3427| [47] [Miyoko]
225: 3430| [45] ["You're 'manipulating memories'."]
226: 3453| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 3456| [45] ["Ah...!"]
228: 3482| [47] [Miyoko]
229: 3485| [45] ["You can replace original memories with new ones. Or delete memories entirely."]
230: 3493| [47] [Yuuri]
231: 3496| [45] ["I-is that possible? I can do that?"]
232: 3504| [47] [Miyoko]
233: 3507| [45] ["Yes. It's the most difficult technique that only those who have mastered all BC abilities can accomplish."]
234: 3533| [47] [Miyoko]
235: 3536| [45] ["As far as I know, only two Communicators in the entire world have successfully done it."]
236: 3544| [47] [Miyoko]
237: 3547| [45] ["But the ability indeed exists."]
238: 3552| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 3553| [45] ["..."]
240: 3580| [47] [Miyoko]
241: 3583| [45] ["BC is the ability to manipulate information. And the human brain is packed with 'information'."]
242: 3591| [47] [Miyoko]
243: 3594| [45] ["Full mastery of Senses Sympathy would allow you to manipulate every single function of the human brain."]
244: 3602| [47] [Miyoko]
245: 3605| [45] ["Just like how Maxwell's demon manipulates information."]
246: 3610| [45] [The professor looked Yuuri in the eye.]
247: 3636| [47] [Miyoko]
248: 3639| [45] ["Yuuri, you're going to become a being beyond human...!"]
249: 3647| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 3650| [45] ["A being beyond human..."]
251: 3698| [45] [She had no desire of her own to become something like that, but if it would please the professor, she would try her best to give it a shot.]
252: 3764| [45] [--And at long last, the "memory manipulation" clinical experiments on mice began.]
253: 3772| [47] [Miyoko]
254: 3775| [45] ["Yuuri. The mouse brain is much more simple than the human brain."]
255: 3783| [47] [Miyoko]
256: 3786| [45] ["It stores far less information in memory."]
257: 3794| [47] [Miyoko]
258: 3797| [45] ["So if you focus very, very, very hard to make its past memories 'disappear'--"]
259: 3805| [47] [Miyoko]
260: 3808| [45] ["The mouse's memory should disappear."]
261: 3841| [45] [As the professor spoke, she pointed to a small corner in the room.]
262: 3846| [45] [There was a small mouse cage with a tiny labyrinth inside.]
263: 3872| [47] [Miyoko]
264: 3875| [45] ["You see, that mouse has been through that maze several times, so it's learned the correct route."]
265: 3883| [47] [Miyoko]
266: 3886| [45] ["Today let's try to erase that mouse's memory."]
267: 3894| [47] [Yuuri]
268: 3897| [45] ["Huh? But Mr. Mouse took all that time to learn it..."]
269: 3923| [47] [Miyoko]
270: 3926| [45] ["... I know it's a pity, but he's a smart mouse, so he'll relearn it quickly."]
271: 3934| [47] [Yuuri]
272: 3937| [45] ["H-hmm... okay, I'll do it."]
273: 3942| [45] [Yuuri walked up to the cage and tried using Senses Sympathy on the mouse.]
274: 4093| [45] [The mouse's simple, abstract thoughts flowed into Yuuri's mind.]
275: 4098| [45] [She searched through the mouse's memory to find the 'maze route'.]
276: 4103| [45] [It was a process similar to recalling one's own memories.]
277: 4108| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 4109| [45] [(Hmm, which one of these is the maze route...?)]
279: 4114| [45] [At that moment, right before Yuuri's eyes floated the mouse's memory of running around inside the maze.]
280: 4119| [47] [Yuuri]
281: 4120| [45] [(I just need to erase this, huh.)]
282: 4291| [45] [Yuuri wished with all her willpower for that memory to disappear.]
283: 4317| [45] [--And that very instant, an intense pain ran through her.]
284: 4322| [47] [Yuuri]
285: 4323| [45] [(!!)]
286: 4444| [45] [Yuuri returned to reality in shock.]
287: 4449| [45] [The mouse went limp in the cage.]
288: 4457| [47] [Yuuri]
289: 4460| [45] ["P-Professor! Something happened to Mr. Mouse!"]
290: 4486| [47] [Miyoko]
291: 4489| [45] ["Don't worry. He's just unconscious."]
292: 4497| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 4500| [45] ["B-but why..."]
294: 4526| [47] [Miyoko]
295: 4529| [45] ["The 'memory' that was in the mouse's brain is a lump of powerful information energy."]
296: 4537| [47] [Miyoko]
297: 4540| [45] ["It's quite different from the mouse's current sensory information."]
298: 4548| [47] [Miyoko]
299: 4551| [45] ["Because memories don't disappear all at once. They remain welled up inside the brain."]
300: 4559| [47] [Miyoko]
301: 4562| [45] ["During memory erasure, you hit a memory with the command 'disappear' in the form of even stronger information energy."]
302: 4588| [47] [Miyoko]
303: 4591| [45] ["The inside of the target's brain reacts violently when you do so."]
304: 4617| [47] [Miyoko]
305: 4620| [45] ["Which is only natural, since the seemingly impossible event of 'instant memory erasure' is forced to occur."]
306: 4628| [47] [Miyoko]
307: 4631| [45] ["Consequently, memory erasure is accompanied by brain damage."]
308: 4639| [47] [Yuuri]
309: 4642| [45] ["No way..."]
310: 4647| [45] [Yuuri looked at the mouse with feelings of guilt in her heart.]
311: 4673| [47] [Miyoko]
312: 4676| [45] ["... Are you frightened by your own power?"]
313: 4684| [47] [Yuuri]
314: 4687| [45] ["... Yes."]
315: 4713| [47] [Miyoko]
316: 4716| [45] ["This is but one of the things you can do with intracerebral information manipulation."]
317: 4724| [47] [Miyoko]
318: 4727| [45] ["Have you come to at least somewhat understand the reason Rank S Aptitude Communicators are feared...?"]
319: 4732| [47] [Yuuri]
320: 4733| [45] ["..."]
321: 4757| [45] [As Yuuri hung her head in shame, the professor hugged her shoulders and spoke gently to her.]
322: 4783| [47] [Miyoko]
323: 4786| [45] ["... Let's end today's experiment here."]
324: 4791| [45] [Yuuri nodded softly, her heart fearfully throbbing in pain.]
