  2:   90| [47] [[--Memories with Louise Yui Sannomiya--]]
  3:  171| [45] [--One day, about three months after he had talked with Mashiro about the future--]
  4:  176| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke with Salyu in the lodging courtyard.]
  5:  182| [45] [--After the incident, Natsuhiko and the others--]
  6:  187| [45] [Had been living in a certain place in Hokkaido, with lodging provided by the ESP Bureau under Ena's guidance.]
  7:  192| [45] [They spent their days hiding from the media and the Rokumei City government, away from their hometown.]
  8:  197| [45] [One day, around 10 months after they had begun living like this,]
  9:  202| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu talked in the lodging courtyard...]
 10:  267| [45] [That day, Salyu had invited Natsuhiko to go see the stars with her.]
 11:  272| [45] [Stargazing was apparently Salyu's hobby. She had invited Yuuri and Mashiro occasionally too.]
 12:  381| [45] [As Salyu gazed at the stars tirelessly, Natsuhiko asked her a question.]
 13:  389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  392| [45] ["Salyu, are you having fun?"]
 15:  400| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  403| [45] ["Yes."]
 17:  411| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  414| [45] ["The sky changes with time, and the constellations change with the seasons. Quite interesting."]
 19:  422| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  425| [45] ["I see. That is interesting."]
 21:  430| [45] [The more Salyu invited him to go stargazing, the more Natsuhiko became interested in the stars.]
 22:  435| [45] [He started to consider buying a telescope when Salyu then whispered.]
 23:  443| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  446| [45] ["... Remember, Natsuhiko?"]
 25:  454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  457| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 27:  465| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  468| [45] ["How we once looked at the night sky together like this,"]
 29:  476| [47] [Salyu]
 30:  479| [45] ["and I talked about how Yuuri's, Mashiro's, and your names have something in common?"]
 31:  487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  490| [45] ["Yeah, of course."]
 33:  555| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, he remembered.]
 34:  560| [45] [Right after Salyu came to the Tenkawa household, she did indeed say that.]
 35:  614| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  617| [45] ["Altair, Hikoboshi, me. Vega, Orihime, Lyra, Koto, Yuuri. And the bird wings that cover the Heavenly River, the Milky Way, are Mashiro... right?"]
 37:  625| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  628| [45] ["Yes."]
 39:  636| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  639| [45] ["But I've also noticed something else in common besides that."]
 41:  647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  650| [45] ["Huh?"]
 43:  658| [47] [Salyu]
 44:  661| [45] ["Look at those stars."]
 45:  705| [45] [Salyu pointed to three conspicuously bright stars.]
 46:  713| [47] [Salyu]
 47:  716| [45] ["Altair, Vega, and one more big star, right?"]
 48:  725| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  728| [45] ["Deneb, of the constellation Cygnus... Together, these three stars are called the Summer Triangle."]
 50:  765| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  768| [45] ["Cygnus, the swan. Swans are white birds. Mashiro Toba, 'white bird wings'."]
 52:  776| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  779| [45] ["Hmm? Hmmmm? That's a little bit of a stretch, don't you--"]
 54:  796| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  799| [45] ["It's not a stretch. It's a solid commonality."]
 56:  804| [45] [Salyu spoke clearly and resolutely. She wasn't taking no for an answer.]
 57:  812| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  815| [45] ["I-I see... you're right, that is a solid commonality. Yeah."]
 59:  863| [47] [Salyu]
 60:  866| [45] ["It's almost like the Summer Triangle is a symbol of how strong your bonds are."]
 61:  874| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  877| [45] ["I'm jealous. That leaves me out."]
 63:  885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  888| [45] ["J-jealous...?"]
 65:  896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  899| [45] ["Um... What are you trying to get at...?"]
 67:  937| [45] [Salyu spoke to the confused Natsuhiko without taking her eyes off the sky.]
 68:  945| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  948| [45] ["As we lived this secluded life, I finally understood."]
 70:  956| [47] [Salyu]
 71:  959| [45] ["There's something between you three that I can never get myself into..."]
 72:  967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  970| [45] ["What? That's not true. The four of us are all friends--"]
 74:  978| [47] [Salyu]
 75:  981| [45] ["No, not that."]
 76:  989| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  992| [45] ["Then what?"]
 78: 1000| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1003| [45] ["You three make a triangle. A love triangle."]
 80: 1026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1029| [45] ["...!"]
 82: 1034| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
 83: 1039| [45] [That was the first time he had ever heard Salyu talk about such a topic.]
 84: 1054| [47] [Alice]
 85: 1057| [45] ["Kyuu...!"]
 86: 1062| [45] [Alice cried as if she had read Natsuhiko's bewilderment.]
 87: 1080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1083| [45] ["W-well, okay, yeah, we might be in that kind of relationship, I guess-- but what do you mean you're jealous?"]
 89: 1091| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1094| [45] ["Oh, I know! You'd feel bitter if Yuuri takes Mashiro away, right?"]
 91: 1102| [47] [Salyu]
 92: 1105| [45] ["No. I want to participate in your love triangle too."]
 93: 1128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1131| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 95: 1139| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1142| [45] ["I still can't read the atmosphere. So I won't bother trying. I'll confess now."]
 97: 1150| [47] [Salyu]
 98: 1153| [45] ["I love you too, Natsuhiko."]
 99: 1182| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1185| [45] ["!!!??"]
101: 1200| [47] [Alice]
102: 1203| [45] ["Gyuehh--!"]
103: 1218| [45] [Now Natsuhiko was completely taken by surprise.]
104: 1223| [45] [He knew there was a nonzero chance of that possibility, but still--!]
105: 1231| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1234| [45] ["H-hold on, Salyu. I'm happy to hear that, but..."]
107: 1242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1245| [45] ["But... why!? Let me be honest here. I'm not that popular a guy!"]
109: 1253| [47] [Salyu]
110: 1256| [45] ["No idea. Not sure why myself."]
111: 1264| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1267| [45] ["Perhaps it's only because you were the first person of the opposite sex I came in contact with in the outside world."]
113: 1275| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1278| [45] ["Perhaps it's like how baby birds go through imprinting."]
115: 1286| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1289| [45] ["... Ah, right. Right."]
117: 1297| [47] [Salyu]
118: 1300| [45] ["No, no. That was a joke."]
119: 1346| [45] [Salyu glanced at Natsuhiko and smiled impishly.]
120: 1392| [45] [She looked back to the sky and continued.]
121: 1400| [47] [Salyu]
122: 1403| [45] ["... There are many reasons."]
123: 1486| [47] [Salyu]
124: 1489| [45] ["Take last year's September 16 for example. Early that morning, when you, Mashiro and I decided to head for LABO--"]
125: 1497| [47] [Salyu]
126: 1500| [45] ["You said you were going to protect the entire city. Even though I had my hands full protecting just you two."]
127: 1508| [47] [Salyu]
128: 1511| [45] ["I thought that was very cool."]
129: 1516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1519| [45] ["Huh...?"]
131: 1524| [45] [Salyu spoke of fondly of her memory of Natsuhiko.]
132: 1587| [47] [Salyu]
133: 1590| [45] ["It was the same when we reunited in LABO."]
134: 1595| [47] [Salyu]
135: 1598| [45] ["When you ran up to me even though your entire body was riddled with gunshot wounds, it made me so happy I could cry."]
136: 1650| [47] [Salyu]
137: 1653| [45] ["When Kazami and the others were infected with malice, you confronted Subject N regardless of the risk it brought you."]
138: 1705| [47] [Salyu]
139: 1708| [45] ["You overcame the fear that your very existence could disappear, and you fought for everyone's sake."]
140: 1763| [47] [Salyu]
141: 1766| [45] ["... Mashiro and Yuuri will never tell you this outright. So I'll say it instead."]
142: 1815| [47] [Salyu]
143: 1818| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you're an amazing person."]
144: 1826| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1829| [45] ["You're so cool and gentle. That's why I've fallen in love with you."]
146: 1837| [47] [Salyu]
147: 1840| [45] ["... Those are my reasons. End of discussion."]
148: 1845| [45] [Even in the twilight, Salyu's cheeks were visibly flushed as she finished speaking.]
149: 1850| [45] [Natsuhiko's cheeks were probably the same.]
150: 1899| [45] [He couldn't help but avert his eyes as he responded to such honest joy and embarrassment.]
151: 1907| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1910| [45] ["Thank you, Salyu..."]
153: 1918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 1921| [45] ["I think you're quite a lovely girl too. I'm grateful, too."]
155: 1929| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1932| [45] ["Thanks for always protecting me."]
157: 1940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1943| [45] ["So if you're ever in a pinch, I'll protect you too--"]
159: 1986| [47] [Salyu]
160: 1989| [45] ["Forget that for now."]
161: 1997| [47] [Salyu]
162: 2000| [45] ["More importantly, Natsuhiko, who do you choose?"]
163: 2008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2011| [45] ["...!"]
165: 2072| [45] [A sudden choice. Natsuhiko was terrified.]
166: 2123| [47] [Alice]
167: 2126| [45] ["Gyuuuu...!"]
168: 2131| [45] [Alice let out a bizarre cry.]
169: 2136| [45] [The emotion it conveyed-- Fear.]
170: 2151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2152| [45] [(There's no way to answer that without causing trouble...!)]
172: 2208| [45] [But regardless, Natsuhiko had to choose.]
173: 2227| [45] [The time to decide drew near.]
174: 2246| [45] [And his decision--!]
175: 2300| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2301| [45] [(... Wait...!)]
177: 2306| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2307| [45] [(There's no way I can just answer that question in this situation!)]
179: 2312| [45] [--was that he couldn't find the words he had to say.]
180: 2317| [45] [Even if he could find an answer, he didn't have the courage to vocalize it.]
181: 2357| [45] [So reluctantly and timidly, he told Salyu...]
182: 2365| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2368| [45] ["I-I love you all...! That's... not going to cut it, is it?"]
184: 2422| [47] [Salyu]
185: 2425| [45] ["... Indecisiveness will be the end of you."]
186: 2507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 2510| [45] ["Ghh!"]
188: 2523| [45] [Salyu elbowed Natsuhiko in the stomach.]
189: 2528| [45] [As he reeled in from the pain, Natsuhiko thought to himself.]
190: 2533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2534| [45] [(I deserved that...)]
