  1:    5| [45] [However-- Ena spoke up in an exasperated voice when she saw Watase trembling.]
  2:   31| [47] [Ena]
  3:   34| [45] ["For crying out loud... I'm so disappointed in you."]
  4:   42| [47] [Watase]
  5:   45| [45] ["Huh...?"]
  6:   71| [47] [Ena]
  7:   74| [45] ["I mean, you said you trust me--"]
  8:  100| [47] [Ena]
  9:  103| [45] ["But that doesn't hold any water when you clearly don't trust yourself."]
 10:  111| [47] [Watase]
 11:  114| [45] ["S-sorry..."]
 12:  140| [47] [Ena]
 13:  143| [45] ["Stop it. Don't let me see you with that look of despair on your face."]
 14:  169| [47] [Ena]
 15:  172| [45] ["You are indeed suspicious-- your amnesia and the security footage attest to that."]
 16:  180| [47] [Ena]
 17:  183| [45] ["But even when I take that into account, I want to trust you."]
 18:  209| [47] [Ena]
 19:  212| [45] ["And yet here you are, assuming your own guilt without proof..."]
 20:  220| [47] [Watase]
 21:  223| [45] ["... But I don't have any memories of my past, you know?"]
 22:  231| [47] [Watase]
 23:  234| [45] ["If my past self was someone who held malice in his heart--"]
 24:  260| [47] [Ena]
 25:  263| [45] ["It doesn't matter who your past self was."]
 26:  271| [47] [Ena]
 27:  274| [45] ["The indisputable truth is that you have been pushing yourself to your limits to save people."]
 28:  300| [47] [Ena]
 29:  303| [45] ["Are you saying you can't trust what I say ever after I saw all that?"]
 30:  308| [47] [Watase]
 31:  309| [45] ["..."]
 32:  335| [47] [Ena]
 33:  338| [45] ["I see... so words alone won't do it, huh..."]
 34:  346| [47] [Ena]
 35:  349| [45] ["Fine then. Then let's try something besides words."]
 36:  383| [45] [Ena put her hands on Watase's shoulders as she said that--]
 37:  499| [47] [Watase]
 38:  500| [45] [(...!!)]
 39:  505| [45] [Watase froze on instinct when he saw Ena's face approaching him.]
 40:  510| [45] [However-- Ena suddenly stopped just before their noses could come in contact with each other.]
 41:  561| [47] [Ena]
 42:  564| [45] ["H-hey... it's considered rude not to close your eyes at a time like this, right?"]
 43:  572| [47] [Watase]
 44:  575| [45] ["Ah, no, uh..."]
 45:  623| [47] [Ena]
 46:  626| [45] ["--Look, just shut them already! Are you -trying- to embarrass me!?"]
 47:  631| [45] [Watase frantically shut his eyes.]
 48:  679| [45] [He felt a soft sensation against his lips.]
 49:  684| [45] [Ena's lips were trembling ever so slightly.]
 50:  734| [45] [Watase opened his eyes to find Ena staring at him with a nervous look on her face.]
 51:  742| [47] [Ena]
 52:  745| [45] ["Well? You convinced now?"]
 53:  753| [47] [Ena]
 54:  756| [45] ["That's my way of saying I trust you from the bottom of my heart."]
 55:  761| [45] [Watase had no clue what he should say.]
 56:  766| [45] [Without his memories, it was essentially the first kiss of his life.]
 57:  771| [45] [Ena swiftly looked away as if she could tell what Watase was thinking.]
 58:  819| [47] [Ena]
 59:  822| [45] ["D-don't get me wrong... this is, uh, how do I put it... like a charm, yeah."]
 60:  830| [47] [Watase]
 61:  833| [45] ["A charm?"]
 62:  838| [45] [Ena let out a slightly lonely laugh when she heard that and continued.]
 63:  886| [47] [Ena]
 64:  889| [45] ["Yes, one to give you back the confidence you need."]
 65:  897| [47] [Ena]
 66:  900| [45] ["It worked, didn't it? I thought it was quite generous."]
 67:  905| [45] [Watase didn't understand the meaning of the smile Ena was giving him.]
 68:  910| [45] [But those feelings she was showing him were the real thing.]
 69:  918| [47] [Watase]
 70:  921| [45] ["Yeah... thanks, Teach."]
 71:  929| [47] [Watase]
 72:  932| [45] ["I'll believe in the 'current me' that you believe in."]
 73:  937| [45] [There was someone out there who truly believed in him when even he couldn't believe in himself--]
 74:  942| [45] [Watase was grateful for that more than anything else right now.]
 75:  947| [45] [And he felt like he could trust her with his life.]
 76:  955| [47] [Watase]
 77:  958| [45] ["Hey, Teach..."]
 78:  966| [47] [Watase]
 79:  969| [45] ["If the 'me' you know now vanishes forever and I turn out to be a black-hearted person when I get my memories back..."]
 80:  977| [47] [Watase]
 81:  980| [45] ["Will you stop me?"]
 82: 1025| [45] [Ena's face darkened for a second at those words.]
 83: 1030| [45] [However--]
 84: 1075| [45] [She gently smiled at him and nodded.]
 85: 1080| [45] [Watase's heart lightened at that moment, his reservations completely disappearing.]
