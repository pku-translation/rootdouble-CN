  1:   55| [45] [--Area 1, inner ring, B2.]
  2:   60| [45] [They had returned to the place where Watase had first woken up.]
  3:   65| [45] [They split up again and searched the floor, but--]
  4:  127| [47] [Jun]
  5:  130| [45] ["Nothing of value on this floor either, huh?"]
  6:  138| [47] [Watase]
  7:  141| [45] ["Then let's head down to B1 this ti..."]
  8:  147| [45] [Watase suddenly picked up a faint sound before he could finish.]
  9:  155| [47] [Watase]
 10:  158| [45] ["...?"]
 11:  185| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  188| [45] ["Hmm? Is something the matter?"]
 13:  196| [47] [Watase]
 14:  199| [45] ["No... I just thought I heard someone's footsteps or something..."]
 15:  246| [47] [Jun]
 16:  249| [45] ["Huh!? From where!?"]
 17:  254| [45] [Watase tried to make out where he'd heard the footsteps.]
 18:  262| [47] [Watase]
 19:  265| [45] ["I can't be sure about this... but I think they came from the stairwell...!"]
 20:  291| [47] [Jun]
 21:  294| [45] ["Think it's one of the survivors!?"]
 22:  320| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  323| [45] ["No, it could be Ms. Tachibana and Ms. Tsubakiyama for all we know."]
 24:  331| [47] [Watase]
 25:  334| [45] ["I dunno, but we'd better take a look!"]
 26:  339| [45] [The team ran for the stairwell in high spirits.]
 27:  389| [45] [But there was no sign of anyone there.]
 28:  394| [45] [The fireproof door on B1 was wide open. The room was dimly illuminated by the light leaking in through that opening.]
 29:  399| [45] [There was no one to be found at the top of the stairs or behind the shadows of the staircase.]
 30:  432| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  435| [45] ["... No one's here?"]
 32:  443| [47] [Watase]
 33:  446| [45] ["Mmm, maybe I was just imagining things."]
 34:  479| [47] [Jun]
 35:  482| [45] ["You don't know that for sure. Maybe they went up."]
 36:  487| [45] [The team ascended the staircase as they talked, with Watase in the front, Ukita in the middle, and Jun in the back.]
 37:  493| [45] [But at that moment--]
 38:  498| [45] [They heard a sound cutting through the air above them.]
 39:  584| [47] [Watase]
 40:  587| [45] ["!?"]
 41:  592| [45] [Watase looked up in surprise.]
 42:  597| [45] [He then saw something falling down from the top of the stairw-]
 43:  655| [47] [Jun]
 44:  658| [45] ["Captain, look out!!"]
 45:  663| [45] [Jun screamed.]
 46:  692| [47] [Watase]
 47:  695| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 48:  700| [45] [Watase suddenly felt someone shove him from behind, causing him to fall forward.]
 49:  743| [45] [And merely a second later, he heard a heavy thud coming from the rear!]
 50:  769| [47] [Jun]
 51:  772| [45] ["Kah... agh!"]
 52:  792| [45] [Watase turned around in shock to see a mysterious object hit Jun's back.]
 53:  797| [45] [It was a cluster of concrete with several thin reinforcing bars sticking out of it.]
 54:  802| [45] [Jun then staggered--]
 55:  810| [47] [Watase]
 56:  813| [45] ["Ah!"]
 57:  818| [45] [Watase tried to grab her, but it was too late.]
 58:  832| [47] [Jun]
 59:  835| [45] ["--!!"]
 60:  840| [45] [Jun fell down the stairs, only stopping at B2's landing.]
 61:  848| [47] [Watase]
 62:  851| [45] ["Mo... Moribe!"]
 63:  884| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  887| [45] ["A-are you all right!?"]
 65:  941| [45] [Watase and Ukita hurried down the stairs, their faces pale.]
 66:  990| [47] [Jun]
 67:  993| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 68:  998| [45] [Jun groaned faintly. She had apparently lost consciousness.]
 69: 1003| [45] [Watase checked her, and soon found blood oozing from her back.]
 70: 1008| [45] [She'd been impaled on one of the reinforcing bars from the debris.]
 71: 1016| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1019| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell just happened!?"]
 73: 1024| [45] [Watase looked upstairs.]
 74: 1029| [45] [But with all the darkness filling the stairwell, he couldn't spot anyone.]
 75: 1034| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1035| [45] [(Did the ceiling collapse again!?)]
 77: 1043| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1046| [45] ["It's too dangerous here, old man! Let's get Moribe to a safe place for now!"]
 79: 1072| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1075| [45] ["G-got it!"]
 81: 1080| [45] [Watase carried Jun on his back and ran out the stairwell.]
