301: 2688| [45] ["Oh, good timing."]
302: 2714| [47] [Mashiro]
303: 2717| [45] ["What a lifesaver!"]
304: 2722| [45] [And the three of them boarded the bus as they chatted amongst themselves.]
305: 2891| [45] [It was a little crowded inside.]
306: 2896| [45] [There were probably other people who rushed to board the bus after the rain started to fall, too.]
307: 2901| [45] [Natsuhiko let Salyu and Mashiro sit in the seats and stood next to them.]
308: 2955| [47] [Mashiro]
309: 2958| [45] ["Aww, if only the weather were nicer, I would've liked to go out for a while."]
310: 2966| [47] [Natsuhiko]
311: 2969| [45] ["Huh? What, more shopping?"]
312: 3017| [47] [Mashiro]
313: 3020| [45] ["I mean, Salyu still doesn't know this town at all, right?"]
314: 3028| [47] [Salyu]
315: 3031| [45] ["I did look around a little on the first day, but I admit, I still don't know that much."]
316: 3039| [47] [Natsuhiko]
317: 3042| [45] ["I see. I guess you're right..."]
318: 3055| [45] [Natsuhiko thought for a second before speaking.]
319: 3063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
320: 3066| [45] ["... Well, the day after tomorrow's a Sunday, so how about we go around town then?"]
321: 3114| [47] [Mashiro]
322: 3117| [45] ["Ah, sounds good!"]
323: 3122| [45] [Mashiro's eyes gleamed at Natsuhiko's proposal.]
324: 3127| [45] [--Usually, Natsuhiko spent his Sundays with Yuuri.]
325: 3132| [45] [But just this once probably wouldn't hurt.]
326: 3140| [47] [Natsuhiko]
327: 3143| [45] ["Well, that said, there's nothing really to see in terms of tourist attractions. It is kind of an odd city, after all."]
328: 3151| [47] [Salyu]
329: 3154| [45] ["... That's fine."]
330: 3202| [47] [Mashiro]
331: 3205| [45] ["Then how about we go look at some of the research facilities that allow it?"]
332: 3213| [47] [Salyu]
333: 3216| [45] ["Also, if at all possible, there's a little more shopping I'd like to do."]
334: 3224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
335: 3227| [45] ["Huh? Did you think of something you want to buy?"]
336: 3235| [47] [Salyu]
337: 3238| [45] ["Books. I did bring just one book from home, but I want more."]
338: 3246| [47] [Natsuhiko]
339: 3249| [45] ["Huh? Just one book? Did you not bring anything else?"]
340: 3257| [47] [Salyu]
341: 3260| [45] ["Anything else? You mean like everyday necessities?"]
342: 3268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
343: 3271| [45] ["No, not like that. I mean did you bring anything like keepsakes of your home or anything..."]
344: 3279| [47] [Salyu]
345: 3282| [45] ["Nothing."]
346: 3290| [47] [Mashiro]
347: 3293| [45] ["Huh? Really now?"]
348: 3298| [45] [Natsuhiko was a little surprised to hear that too.]
349: 3306| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 3309| [45] ["... If I were 13 and moved away from my family to a faraway country, I think I'd get pretty homesick."]
351: 3317| [47] [Salyu]
352: 3320| [45] ["I don't harbor that sort of emotion at all. I have no particular attachment to my hometown."]
353: 3328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
354: 3331| [45] ["I-I see..."]
355: 3339| [47] [Mashiro]
356: 3342| [45] ["Then whaddaya think about this town? Think you can get any emotional attachment here?"]
357: 3350| [47] [Salyu]
358: 3353| [45] ["... Hard to judge. I don't know for sure if I like it or hate it."]
359: 3361| [47] [Mashiro]
360: 3364| [45] ["Oh boy, that's kinda blunt..."]
361: 3372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
362: 3375| [45] ["Well, she just got to Japan recently, so she can't tell for certain if she likes it or hates it yet."]
363: 3383| [47] [Mashiro]
364: 3386| [45] ["Y-yeah, I guess that's true."]
365: 3394| [47] [Mashiro]
366: 3397| [45] ["Well, let's just set that question aside for now."]
367: 3405| [47] [Salyu]
368: 3408| [45] ["But still, regardless, I would like to go shopping. With you two."]
369: 3416| [45] [After Natsuhiko muttered that, Mashiro spoke from beside him.]
370: 3424| [47] [Mashiro]
371: 3427| [45] ["... Well, the day after tomorrow's a Sunday, so how about we go around town then?"]
372: 3435| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 3438| [45] ["Ah, yeah, sounds good."]
374: 3443| [45] [--Usually, Natsuhiko spent his Sundays with Yuuri.]
375: 3448| [45] [But just this once probably wouldn't hurt.]
376: 3496| [47] [Mashiro]
377: 3499| [45] ["Well, that said, there's nothing really to see in terms of tourist attractions. It is kind of an odd city, I'd say."]
378: 3507| [47] [Salyu]
379: 3510| [45] ["... That's fine."]
380: 3518| [47] [Mashiro]
381: 3521| [45] ["Then how about we go look at some of the research facilities that allow it?"]
382: 3529| [47] [Salyu]
383: 3532| [45] ["Also, if at all possible, there's a little more shopping I'd like to do."]
384: 3540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
385: 3543| [45] ["Huh? Did you think of something you want to buy?"]
386: 3551| [47] [Salyu]
387: 3554| [45] ["Books. I did bring just one book from home, but I already finished reading it."]
388: 3602| [47] [Mashiro]
389: 3605| [45] ["I see, I see. Then pardon me for being forward, but allow me to pick some titles from the '90s golden age of sci-fi for you to try!"]
390: 3613| [47] [Mashiro]
391: 3616| [45] ["There are so many legendary titles to choose from.%NLike 'Neon Genocide Vangel' and 'Ghost in the Core'."]
392: 3624| [47] [Salyu]
393: 3627| [45] ["I've never heard of those titles... Very interesting."]
394: 3632| [45] [Those weren't books but anime titles-- but Natsuhiko didn't have the heart to say it.]
395: 3680| [47] [Salyu]
396: 3683| [45] ["Natsuhiko, is there anything you want to buy?"]
397: 3691| [47] [Natsuhiko]
398: 3694| [45] ["No, not in particular..."]
399: 3702| [47] [Mashiro]
400: 3705| [45] ["That's a little boring."]
401: 3753| [47] [Mashiro]
402: 3756| [45] ["... I know! Let's pick out clothes for Natsuhiko this time!"]
403: 3764| [47] [Natsuhiko]
404: 3767| [45] ["Huh, no, you don't need to."]
405: 3775| [47] [Mashiro]
406: 3778| [45] ["Why not? You've actually got some nice looks to start out with, so you can't let it go to waste by being plain all the time."]
407: 3786| [47] [Natsuhiko]
408: 3789| [45] ["Whoa there... you don't want to make me your next dress up doll, do you?"]
409: 3797| [47] [Mashiro]
410: 3800| [45] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
411: 3805| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly at Mashiro's playfulness.]
412: 3810| [45] [But he had to admit, going shopping as a group did seem like fun.]
413: 3818| [47] [Natsuhiko]
414: 3821| [45] ["Well, fine... I guess it might be nice to go shopping every now and then."]
415: 3829| [47] [Mashiro]
416: 3832| [45] ["Okay, so the day after tomorrow, we go around the city and go shopping too?"]
417: 3840| [47] [Mashiro]
418: 3843| [45] ["I'm sure it'll be fun! Ah man, can the day after tomorrow come any sooner...?"]
419: 3848| [45] [As soon as Mashiro said that,]
420: 3897| [47] [Mashiro]
421: 3900| [45] ["... Hmm?"]
422: 3905| [45] [her eyes opened wide as if she had noticed something.]
423: 3913| [47] [Salyu]
424: 3916| [45] ["...?"]
425: 3924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
426: 3927| [45] ["What's wrong?"]
427: 3932| [45] [Natsuhiko called out to her dubiously.]
428: 3937| [45] [But Mashiro didn't answer.]
429: 3982| [45] [Far from it. She just stared straight ahead without saying a word--]
430: 3990| [47] [Mashiro]
431: 3993| [45] ["!"]
432: 3998| [45] [Her face just froze abruptly.]
433: 4003| [45] [Something was clearly wrong. Natsuhiko got worried and whispered to her.]
434: 4011| [47] [Natsuhiko]
435: 4014| [45] ["Hey, Mashiro... hey!"]
436: 4062| [47] [Mashiro]
437: 4065| [45] ["!"]
438: 4070| [45] [That's when Mashiro slowly turned back and looked at Natsuhiko as if she had come back to her senses.]
439: 4078| [47] [Mashiro]
440: 4081| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko..."]
441: 4089| [47] [Natsuhiko]
442: 4092| [45] ["What's wrong? Did something happen?"]
443: 4100| [47] [Mashiro]
444: 4103| [45] ["Umm... umm..."]
445: 4108| [45] [Mashiro looked around the bus, stammering.]
446: 4113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
447: 4114| [45] [(What's wrong?)]
448: 4119| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around the bus too, but he didn't see anything happening.]
449: 4124| [45] [Everyone was just sitting quietly in their seats.]
450: 4132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
451: 4135| [45] ["... Honestly, what's wrong?"]
452: 4140| [47] [Mashiro]
453: 4141| [45] ["..."]
454: 4146| [45] [Mashiro didn't answer for a while, but eventually, she spoke with a smile.]
455: 4200| [47] [Mashiro]
456: 4203| [45] ["Sorry. It's nothing."]
457: 4211| [47] [Natsuhiko]
458: 4214| [45] ["You call that 'nothing'...?"]
459: 4222| [47] [Mashiro]
460: 4225| [45] ["Ah, actually, I had the feeling someone told us to shut up."]
461: 4233| [47] [Natsuhiko]
462: 4236| [45] ["Huh? Oh yeah, I guess we did get a little carried away..."]
463: 4244| [47] [Salyu]
464: 4247| [45] ["Oh no. I'll reflect on my actions too."]
465: 4255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
466: 4258| [45] ["Yeah, let's bring it down a notch."]
467: 4263| [45] [That said, Natsuhiko was actually relieved at Mashiro's answer.]
468: 4268| [45] [The three of them then quietly waited to reach their destination.]
469: 4273| [45] [Once they got quiet, the bus was filled with silence.]
470: 4278| [45] [But occasionally--]
471: 4283| [47] [Alice]
472: 4286| [45] ["Grrrrr..."]
473: 4291| [45] [Alice would faintly growl. Aside from that, the bus was silent.]
