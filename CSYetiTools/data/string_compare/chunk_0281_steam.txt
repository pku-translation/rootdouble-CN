  0:   64| [45] [--That night, Natsuhiko was transferred from Rokumei City Hospital to LABO.]
  1:   69| [45] [He was laid on a bed in the neuroscience laboratory.]
  2:  130| [45] [Yuuri and the professor stood next to him and looked at his face.]
  3:  153| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't respond to Yuuri's presence.]
  4:  158| [45] [His eyes were shut.]
  5:  221| [47] [Miyoko]
  6:  224| [45] ["He was put to sleep with drugs..."]
  7:  232| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  235| [45] ["If you manipulate his memories now, he'll never even be aware of it."]
  9:  240| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  241| [45] ["..."]
 11:  286| [45] [It still took some time for Yuuri to find her resolve.]
 12:  291| [45] [After a long period of silence, she spoke resolutely.]
 13:  303| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  306| [45] ["... I'll do it."]
 15:  332| [47] [Miyoko]
 16:  335| [45] ["Okay... Please begin."]
 17:  343| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  346| [45] ["All right."]
 19:  391| [45] [Yuuri nodded and looked at the sleeping boy's face.]
 20:  396| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  397| [45] [(Looks like it's time to say goodbye, Hikorin...)]
 22:  402| [45] [Yuuri's mind was calm.]
 23:  407| [45] [She resolved herself to be calm at least just this once.]
 24:  412| [47] [Yuuri]
 25:  413| [45] [(Even if you forget about me, I'll never forget about you, Hikorin.)]
 26:  418| [45] [No matter how sad and lonely the rest of her days would be.]
 27:  423| [45] [She burned the image of his sleeping face in her mind, lest she forget about this day.]
 28:  428| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  429| [45] [(Goodbye...)]
 30:  439| [45] [Finally, Yuuri reached out her hand--]
 31:  449| [45] [--and touched Natsuhiko's forehead.]
 32:  608| [45] [--Just then.]
 33:  613| [45] [Countless visions floated before Yuuri's eyes.]
 34:  618| [45] [They were memories that were not her own.]
 35:  623| [45] [Rather, they were Natsuhiko's memories of her.]
 36:  628| [45] [Yuuri peered into the first of them.]
 37:  778| [45] [--It was the memory of the day Yuuri and Natsuhiko first met.]
 38:  786| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  789| [45] ["Hey, hey, why are you crying?"]
 40:  797| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  800| [45] ["Hweh...?"]
 42:  826| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  829| [45] ["... U-um... who are you?"]
 44:  837| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  840| [45] ["I'm Natsuhiko."]
 46:  848| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  851| [45] ["... Natsu... hiko...?"]
 48:  859| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  862| [45] ["You're 'Yuuri Kotono', right? Your family just moved in nearby."]
 50:  888| [47] [Yuuri]
 51:  891| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 52:  899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  902| [45] ["Let's be friends. We live in the same neighborhood, after all."]
 54:  925| [45] [It was a memory that Yuuri fondly remembered herself, except this time, she saw it through Natsuhiko's point of view.]
 55:  947| [47] [Yuuri]
 56:  948| [45] [(This sure brings me back, Hikorin...)]
 57:  953| [47] [Yuuri]
 58:  954| [45] [(You surprised me at first, you know?)]
 59:  959| [47] [Yuuri]
 60:  960| [45] [(You called out to me so suddenly that you seemed like kind of a rough boy to me...)]
 61:  965| [47] [Yuuri]
 62:  966| [45] [(But you know, I was happy.)]
 63:  971| [47] [Yuuri]
 64:  972| [45] [(Because thanks to you, every day after that was a fun day for me.)]
 65:  977| [45] [But she couldn't just keep gazing at this memory forever.]
 66:  982| [45] [Yuuri focused hard. To erase this memory.]
 67:  987| [45] [And soon enough, the vision grew hazy--]
 68: 1076| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1079| [45] ["You're '----- Kotono', right?"]
 70: 1132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1135| [45] ["---'re '------------', ri---?"]
 72: 1146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1147| [45] ["------ '------------', -----?"]
 74: 1222| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1223| [45] ["----------------------------------------"]
 76: 1285| [45] [--and it disappeared.]
 77: 1356| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1359| [45] [{!!!}]
 79: 1364| [45] [And at the same time, Yuuri heard what sounded like Natsuhiko screaming.]
 80: 1369| [45] [Even though he was stupefied, he probably still felt the damage of memory erasure.]
 81: 1374| [47] [Yuuri]
 82: 1375| [45] [(I'm sorry, Hikorin, I'm so sorry...!)]
 83: 1486| [45] [Yuuri hardened her heart and transferred her consciousness to the next memory.]
 84: 1491| [45] [Upon which, a different vision floated before her.]
 85: 1634| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1637| [45] ["What do you want to be when you grow up, Yuuri?"]
 87: 1642| [45] [It was a memory of a conversation they had quite a while after they had met.]
 88: 1647| [45] [Yuuri thought "Oh, I almost forgot this happened".]
 89: 1673| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1676| [45] ["When I grow up?"]
 91: 1684| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1687| [45] ["There are a lot of things I want to be, so I just can't choose."]
 93: 1713| [47] [Yuuri]
 94: 1716| [45] ["Hmm... When I grow up..."]
 95: 1742| [47] [Yuuri]
 96: 1745| [45] ["I want to be your bride, Hikorin."]
 97: 1768| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1771| [45] ["Wha..."]
 99: 1798| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1801| [45] ["Is that a no? Hikorin, do you hate me?"]
101: 1809| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1812| [45] ["N-no, I don't hate you... but..."]
103: 1817| [45] [It was a silly little conversation that only young children could have.]
104: 1839| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1840| [45] [(Ahahah, Hikorin was so embarrassed. How cute~)]
106: 1845| [45] [Yuuri felt a little embarrassed herself.]
107: 1850| [45] [But unfortunately, this memory could not be allowed to remain.]
108: 1855| [45] [Yuuri wished hard for it to disappear.]
109: 2075| [45] [And thus, yet another memory of Yuuri vanished from Natsuhiko's brain.]
110: 2123| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 2124| [45] [(Okay, that's two down...)]
112: 2129| [45] [Her work was proceeding smoothly.]
113: 2134| [45] [And yet Yuuri's heart throbbed in intense pain.]
114: 2154| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 2155| [45] [(...!)]
116: 2160| [45] [She felt as if with each memory she erased, she tore open a void in her own mind.]
117: 2165| [45] [Even though it wasn't her own memories she was erasing.]
118: 2170| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 2171| [45] [(There's still lots more to go... I gotta keep it up...)]
120: 2285| [45] [Yuuri encouraged herself to continue with her work.]
121: 2429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 2432| [45] ["Man, that sure was interesting!"]
123: 2440| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2443| [45] ["Yeah, we read all the way to the end!"]
125: 2798| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 2801| [45] ["Is this a picture of your mom, Natsuhiko?"]
127: 2809| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 2812| [45] ["Huh? Oh, yeah."]
129: 3152| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 3155| [45] ["... there is one thing that makes me glad I was born a Communicator."]
131: 3163| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 3166| [45] ["Huh?"]
133: 3213| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 3216| [45] ["Well, it's because that's how I met you."]
135: 3224| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 3227| [45] ["If I wasn't a Communicator, I never would've moved to this town."]
137: 3597| [45] [--One by one, the visions came; one by one she erased them.]
138: 3602| [45] [One by one, she killed all traces of herself within Natsuhiko.]
139: 3607| [45] [With each memory erased, Natsuhiko suffered intense pain--]
140: 3612| [45] [And the pain in Yuuri's heart grew little by little as well.]
141: 3617| [45] [But eventually, she had erased just about all of the relevant memories.]
142: 3622| [45] [Including the one of them coming to LABO just a few months ago.]
143: 3627| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 3628| [45] [(There's just one more memory...)]
145: 3633| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 3634| [45] [(One more memory, and I'll have vanished from Hikorin's mind...)]
147: 3746| [45] [Yuuri withstood the pain in her heart to peek into his final memory.]
148: 3882| [47] [Yuuri]
149: 3883| [45] [(--...)]
150: 3888| [45] [But Yuuri gasped once she saw the vision that spread out before her.]
151: 3893| [45] [It was a vast night sky filled with stars all the way across the heavens.]
152: 3898| [45] [The two children looked up at the Milky Way that nostalgic summer night.]
153: 3922| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 3925| [45] ["... The stars sure are pretty, huh?"]
155: 3933| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 3936| [45] ["... Yeah."]
157: 3941| [45] [Natsuhiko responded to Yuuri's words.]
158: 3946| [45] [The two of them were next to each other.]
159: 4039| [45] [Natsuhiko held Yuuri's hand tight as he spoke.]
160: 4047| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 4050| [45] ["... Hey, Yuuri."]
162: 4058| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 4061| [45] ["Huh?"]
164: 4069| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 4072| [45] ["I'll never forget what happened today."]
166: 4080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 4083| [45] ["I'll never forget looking at the stars with you."]
168: 4128| [45] [Those were Natsuhiko's words.]
169: 4150| [45] [If Yuuri but willed it, this memory would sink into the darkness.]
170: 4155| [45] [With that, everything would be wrapped up neatly, and yet--]
171: 4160| [45] [Yuuri couldn't bring herself to do it.]
172: 4330| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 4333| [45] ["... Me too..."]
174: 4341| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 4344| [45] ["... I don't want to forget either, Hikorin."]
176: 4352| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 4355| [45] ["Huh?"]
178: 4360| [45] [Within Natsuhiko's memory, Yuuri's tears streamed out.]
179: 4365| [45] [Even though such a memory was impossible-- It seemed Yuuri began to fabricate his memory with her transcendental ability, almost unconsciously.]
180: 4373| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 4376| [45] ["Wh-what's wrong, Yuuri?"]
182: 4384| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 4387| [45] ["I don't want to erase this memory..."]
184: 4392| [45] [That was the honest desire she had locked up deep within her heart.]
185: 4397| [45] [Her true feelings.]
186: 4446| [47] [Yuuri]
187: 4449| [45] ["... Please, Hikorin..."]
188: 4457| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 4460| [45] ["Don't forget about me...!"]
190: 4637| [45] [--With that final desire conveyed to Natsuhiko, Yuuri returned to reality.]
191: 4642| [45] [Once she was back, Yuuri cried tears in the real world as well.]
192: 4647| [45] [And in her blurry vision, she saw Dr. Tenkawa peeking at her.]
193: 4673| [47] [Miyoko]
194: 4676| [45] ["Yuuri...?"]
195: 4702| [47] [Miyoko]
196: 4705| [45] ["What's wrong? Did something happen?"]
197: 4754| [45] [Yuuri shut her eyes tight and squeezed out an answer.]
198: 4762| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 4765| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Professor."]
200: 4773| [47] [Yuuri]
201: 4776| [45] ["I can't do it...!"]
202: 4828| [47] [Miyoko]
203: 4831| [45] ["!?"]
204: 4839| [47] [Miyoko]
205: 4842| [45] ["Yuuri, what are you--!?"]
206: 4847| [45] [The professor tried to stop Yuuri.]
207: 4857| [45] [But before she could--]
208: 4862| [45] [--Yuuri used Senses Sympathy once more.]
209: 5010| [45] [Only a single memory of Yuuri remained.]
210: 5015| [45] [But all of the memories Yuuri erased still remained deep within her heart of hearts.]
211: 5020| [45] [For the memories she erased were the memories they shared.]
212: 5025| [45] [--Which meant there was only one thing for her to do.]
213: 5269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 5270| [45] ["--------"]
215: 5460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 5463| [45] ["Hey, hey, why are you crying?"]
217: 5468| [45] [Yuuri reconstructed the memories she erased based on her own knowledge.]
218: 5473| [45] [She restored memory after memory.]
219: 5885| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 5888| [45] ["I want to be your bride, Hikorin."]
221: 6300| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 6303| [45] ["Yeah, we read all the way to the end!"]
223: 6715| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 6718| [45] ["Is this a picture of your mom, Natsuhiko?"]
225: 7116| [47] [Yuuri]
226: 7119| [45] ["... there is one thing that makes me glad I was born a Communicator."]
227: 7166| [47] [Yuuri]
228: 7169| [45] ["Well, it's because that's how I met you."]
229: 7286| [45] [--She was restoring Natsuhiko's memory in a matter of moments.]
230: 7341| [45] [But doing so would mean Natsuhiko would once again know about Yuuri's death.]
231: 7346| [45] [And then he would once again blame himself and shatter his mind.]
232: 7398| [45] [So Yuuri made her resolve.]
233: 7403| [47] [Yuuri]
234: 7404| [45] [(I've got no choice but to replace the "me that's gone" with a "me that's there"...!)]
235: 7517| [45] [Yuuri dove into Natsuhiko's memory of that fateful night.]
236: 7522| [45] [The night Natsuhiko learned of Yuuri's death three months prior--]
237: 7666| [47] [Miyoko]
238: 7669| [45] ["--Natsuhiko, please calm down and listen carefully..."]
239: 7695| [47] [Miyoko]
240: 7698| [45] ["Yuuri..."]
241: 7706| [47] [Miyoko]
242: 7709| [45] ["... Yuuri breathed her last breath last night..."]
243: 7717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 7720| [45] ["... Huh?"]
245: 7728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 7731| [45] ["... No way."]
247: 7739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 7742| [45] ["Why did Yuuri...!?"]
249: 7764| [45] [--In reality, Natsuhiko screamed after this.]
250: 7769| [45] [That was likely the very moment his mind lost its balance.]
251: 7774| [47] [Yuuri]
252: 7775| [45] [(In that case-- this memory just needs to be changed!)]
253: 7780| [45] [Yuuri focused to do just that.]
254: 7785| [45] [To change this memory into a new one--!]
255: 7827| [45] [--And then Natsuhiko screamed, holding back his tears.]
256: 7835| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 7838| [45] ["That's a lie! Yuuri can't be dead!"]
258: 7892| [45] [He jumped out of his bed and ran off.]
259: 7897| [45] [He ran down the hall, searching for Yuuri.]
260: 7905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 7908| [45] ["Yuuri! You're around, aren't you!? Please come out!"]
262: 7913| [45] [No matter how many neighboring rooms he called out to, he got no response.]
263: 7924| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed out of the hospital in search of Yuuri.]
264: 7976| [45] [He aimlessly wandered around town.]
265: 8029| [45] [But he couldn't find her anywhere.]
266: 8082| [45] [Not at her house. Nor at the park where they met. Nor in their nostalgic secret base.]
267: 8138| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 8141| [45] ["Yuuri... Yuuri...!"]
269: 8146| [45] [When he tired of searching, the last place Natsuhiko headed--]
270: 8157| [45] [--was his own home.]
271: 8215| [45] [The house was steeped in darkness.]
272: 8220| [45] [Natsuhiko blankly called out her name.]
273: 8228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
274: 8231| [45] ["... Yuuri."]
275: 8236| [45] [But obviously, he didn't expect to get an answer.]
276: 8241| [45] [However, just then, from across the dark room--]
277: 8283| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 8286| [45] ["Hikorin."]
279: 8291| [45] [Yuuri's voice called out in reply.]
280: 8299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 8302| [45] ["Yuuri!?"]
282: 8326| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed up to her.]
283: 8334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
284: 8337| [45] ["Thank goodness... you're alive..."]
285: 8363| [47] [Yuuri]
286: 8366| [45] ["Hee hee, you thought I was dead?"]
287: 8374| [47] [Natsuhiko]
288: 8377| [45] ["But Mom was saying weird things..."]
289: 8403| [47] [Yuuri]
290: 8406| [45] ["I'm not dead at all."]
291: 8411| [45] [Yuuri smiled at Natsuhiko.]
292: 8437| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 8440| [45] ["See, Hikorin? I'll always be right here."]
294: 8448| [47] [Yuuri]
295: 8451| [45] ["I'll always be with you."]
296: 8477| [47] [Yuuri]
297: 8480| [45] ["So please. Don't forget about me."]
298: 8485| [45] [Those were the words she could not tell him in the real world.]
299: 8490| [45] [But they were the words both Yuuri and Natsuhiko wished for.]
300: 8495| [45] [Even if those words were a lie, they sank deep into Natsuhiko's mind--]
301: 8519| [45] [--and drove away the truth.]
302: 8527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
303: 8530| [45] ["There's no way I'd ever forget."]
304: 8698| [45] [--Once everything was complete, Yuuri returned to reality.]
305: 8703| [45] [The professor murmured in a hollow voice.]
306: 8729| [47] [Miyoko]
307: 8732| [45] ["Yuuri..."]
308: 8740| [47] [Yuuri]
309: 8743| [45] ["I'm sorry, Professor... I... couldn't do it."]
310: 8748| [45] [Yuuri felt genuinely sorry.]
311: 8753| [45] [She knew what she had done was inexcusable, but--]
312: 8779| [47] [Miyoko]
313: 8782| [45] ["... That's fine."]
314: 8787| [45] [--the professor's voice was kind, which only served to deepen the pain in Yuuri's heart.]
315: 8813| [47] [Miyoko]
316: 8816| [45] ["Let's go before Natsuhiko wakes up..."]
317: 8824| [47] [Yuuri]
318: 8827| [45] ["... Okay."]
319: 8832| [45] [They quietly left the laboratory--]
320: 8893| [45] [--leaving Natsuhiko behind.]
321: 8921| [47] [Natsuhiko]

323: 8927| [45] [Natsuhiko was astonished.]
324: 8932| [45] [That was the whole story of what had happened to him.]
325: 8937| [45] [A complete record of a truth unrevealed to him even when he had dived into Mashiro's memory.]
326: 8942| [47] [Natsuhiko]
327: 8943| [45] [(I was only able to wake up from my stupefaction because of Yuuri...!)]
328: 8948| [47] [Natsuhiko]
329: 8949| [45] [(B-but what happened as a result of her efforts...!?)]
330: 8954| [45] [Of course, Natsuhiko himself was well aware of exactly what happened to him after that.]
331: 8959| [45] [But even so, in order to affirm the entire truth, he pursued Yuuri's memories further.]
