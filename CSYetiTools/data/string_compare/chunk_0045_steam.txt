  0:   46| [55] [√After Chapter 3]
  1:   60| [45] [Watase and Kazami first entered B2 of the inner ring.]
  2:  160| [47] [Watase]
  3:  163| [45] ["Those kids are in this area, huh..."]
  4:  189| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  192| [45] ["That's what I hope, at least."]
  6:  242| [45] [After that brief exchange, the two of them checked all the rooms in a hurry.]
  7:  285| [45] [All the while believing they'd find the survivors in one of them.]
  8:  352| [45] [However--]
  9:  457| [45] [Their search yielded no results.]
 10:  465| [47] [Watase]
 11:  468| [45] ["They're not here...?"]
 12:  530| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  533| [45] ["Please hold on. Let's search B1."]
 14:  538| [45] [They headed for the stairs in accordance with Kazami's suggestion--]
 15:  583| [45] [But the inner ring's emergency staircase was unusable.]
 16:  588| [45] [The part on B1 was intact, but everything below it had crumbled, leaving it impossible to climb.]
 17:  596| [47] [Watase]
 18:  599| [45] ["Tch, not again."]
 19:  632| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  635| [45] ["This isn't good. The factory is essentially two floors in one room, so this is the only staircase..."]
 21:  661| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  664| [45] ["Shall we try the elevator shaft again?"]
 23:  672| [47] [Watase]
 24:  675| [45] ["No, wait, is there any way we can get up...?"]
 25:  680| [45] [It was at that moment that Watase remembered what he had with him.]
 26:  740| [45] [The 10 meter rope he'd been carrying around this whole time.]
 27:  748| [47] [Watase]
 28:  751| [45] ["I think we can manage to get up there with this thing."]
 29:  786| [45] [Watase calmly picked up some debris and tied the end of the rope to it.]
 30:  797| [45] [He then tossed the rope up, and it caught on the B1 staircase.]
 31:  860| [45] [He tugged it several times to test its strength, but it appeared that the rope was firmly secure.]
 32:  868| [47] [Watase]
 33:  871| [45] ["Good, we can do this!"]
 34:  897| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  900| [45] ["Yes, climbing this height should prove no issue for either of us."]
 36:  926| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  929| [45] ["You were always particularly good at rope climbing."]
 38:  937| [47] [Watase]
 39:  940| [45] ["Really? Then this'll be perfect."]
 40:  983| [45] [The two of them climbed the rope as they smiled at their playful exchange.]
 41: 1027| [45] [--The two of them then left the rope where it was.]
 42: 1032| [45] [That way they could use it again when they had to go back down, and there was a chance they might need to climb back up anyway.]
 43: 1079| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1082| [45] ["Okay, then let's move on with the search. This is the only other block we haven't explored yet."]
 45: 1144| [47] [Kazami]
 46: 1147| [45] ["Yes!"]
 47: 1161| [45] [The two of them then started searching the floor in high spirits.]
 48: 1205| [45] [The first room they went to appeared to not have been touched by the fire at all.]
 49: 1210| [45] [Kazami spoke up as soon as they walked in.]
 50: 1272| [47] [Kazami]
 51: 1275| [45] ["Oh... there's a Procyon here."]
 52: 1283| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1286| [45] ["Huh?"]
 54: 1384| [45] [Watase looked closer to find a familiar device was lying in a corner of the room.]
 55: 1397| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1400| [45] ["What's something like this doing here?"]
 57: 1426| [47] [Kazami]
 58: 1429| [45] ["It is no surprise. It was LABO who gave us the Procyons in the first place, after all."]
 59: 1437| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1440| [45] ["Oh, right. Anyway, this is a pretty good find. Now we can split into three teams."]
 61: 1466| [47] [Kazami]
 62: 1469| [45] ["Yes. Though I do not know if the need for that will ever arise."]
 63: 1474| [45] [Still, the two of them decided to take it just to be safe.]
 64: 1479| [45] [They looked around to see if there was anything else worth taking with them.]
 65: 1484| [45] [Though they didn't find any AD-- there was a bound stack of papers on the table that Watase took interest in.]
 66: 1492| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1495| [45] ["... Hmm? 'Disaster Prevention Manual'?"]
 68: 1521| [47] [Kazami]
 69: 1524| [45] ["Oh? Isn't that the manual Ms. Yuuri found earlier?"]
 70: 1532| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1535| [45] ["No, it's a bit different. This one says 'For Area 5 and 6 Staff'."]
 72: 1540| [45] [Watase and Kazami stood close together and read the manual.]
 73: 1545| [45] [Most of it was more or less the same as the one Yuuri had shown them, but there was a new page at the very end not present in the other manual.]
 74: 1583| [45] ["Disaster Prevention Manual (2030 Edition/For Area 5 and 6 Staff)"]
 75: 1586| [85] [　]
 76: 1589| [45] [<Regarding Emergency Evacuation Routes>]
 77: 1592| [85] [　]
 78: 1595| [45] [In the event of a fire, earthquake, or other such disasters, the elevators will automatically ascend to the surface floors and stay there.]
 79: 1598| [45] [This is because there is a risk that the elevators could stop while in operation due to an unpredictable shock, therefore trapping their passengers.]
 80: 1601| [45] [Please use the emergency staircases located in each block to evacuate.]
 81: 1604| [45] [However, Area 6's outer ring does not have any emergency staircases due to security risks and the facility's structure.]
 82: 1607| [45] [Therefore, all staff should evacuate through the inner ring, but if a situation arises where that becomes too difficult, please evacuate through the "cargo lift".]
 83: 1611| [85] [ %N]
 84: 1614| [45] [<Regarding usage of cargo lift for evacuation>]
 85: 1617| [85] [　]
 86: 1620| [45] [Unlike the normal elevators, the cargo lift is extremely sturdy.]
 87: 1623| [45] [In theory, it should be able to resist even Magnitude 7 earthquakes and have very little risk of stopping.]
 88: 1626| [45] [Therefore, all staff members are granted temporary permission to use the lift to evacuate during a crisis.]
 89: 1629| [45] [Please use it to promptly evacuate to the surface.]
 90: 1632| [45] [The same rights will also be granted in the event of a Case N.]
 91: 1635| [45] [Should evacuation of the facility become impossible due to the bulkhead lockdown, the cargo lift can be used to evacuate to a safe zone in the surface floors.]
 92: 1664| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1667| [45] ["A cargo lift...!?"]
 94: 1672| [45] [The two of them started trembling when they read that passage.]
 95: 1698| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1701| [45] ["'Evacuate to a safe zone'. Does that mean...!?"]
 97: 1709| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1712| [45] ["That there's a way for us to escape to the surface-- even in this situation!?"]
 99: 1735| [45] [Watase and Kazami looked at each other. They were both grinning from ear to ear.]
100: 1740| [45] [After being trapped in the basement all this time-- they'd finally found the clue they needed about the one escape route that still worked!]
101: 1748| [47] [Watase]
102: 1751| [45] ["But where do you think it is!?"]
103: 1777| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1780| [45] ["It could be somewhere in that burned factory, though I did not notice it earlier."]
105: 1806| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1809| [45] ["But we must look for the survivors first. An escape route means nothing unless we've secured them beforehand."]
107: 1817| [47] [Watase]
108: 1820| [45] ["Yeah!"]
109: 1825| [45] [Watase shoved the manual into his pocket and ran out of the room.]
110: 1868| [45] [However-- in the end, they went through all the rooms, yet found no hide nor hair of the survivors or any AD.]
111: 1931| [47] [Watase]
112: 1934| [45] ["Let's check the connecting passageway. We can't leave any stone unturned."]
113: 1977| [45] [The two of them headed for the connecting passageway that led to the factory.]
114: 2022| [45] [But the passageway was blocked by debris further in, so they couldn't travel past that.]
115: 2027| [45] [The only thing up ahead was the factory, meaning that they'd completed their search of the inner ring.]
116: 2086| [45] [Watase frowned in puzzlement as they turned around.]
117: 2094| [47] [Watase]
118: 2097| [45] ["That's weird... we didn't find any of the survivors anywhere."]
119: 2123| [47] [Kazami]
120: 2126| [45] ["I concur. But they may be in the factory."]
121: 2152| [47] [Kazami]
122: 2155| [45] ["Let's go back and assist the others with their search."]
123: 2163| [47] [Watase]
124: 2166| [45] ["Yeah. Or maybe they--"]
125: 2171| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
126: 2198| [45] [he suddenly heard a sound at his feet.]
127: 2203| [47] [Watase]
128: 2204| [45] [(What's that!?)]
129: 2244| [45] [Watase looked down in surprise--]
130: 2249| [45] [--to see that there were cracks where Kazami was standing.]
131: 2254| [47] [Watase]
132: 2255| [45] [(The floor's giving way!)]
133: 2280| [45] [Just as Watase thought that-- time slowed down for him.]
134: 2305| [45] [He was seeing everything in slow motion.]
135: 2335| [47] [Kazami]
136: 2338| [45] ["!"]
137: 2343| [45] [Kazami noticed the sudden change in her situation and tried to react immediately.]
138: 2348| [45] [--But a second later, the floor at her feet collapsed.]
139: 2461| [47] [Watase]
140: 2464| [45] ["Tachibana!"]
141: 2469| [45] [Watase shot his hand out as fast as lightning and grabbed Kazami's arm.]
142: 2481| [45] [Pain ran through his cracked ribs instantly.]
143: 2486| [47] [Watase]
144: 2487| [45] [(Ghhh!!)]
145: 2492| [45] [But he put up with it and grasped Kazami's arm tightly.]
146: 2497| [45] [Dust blew up from the crumbled floor, but it soon began to clear up--]
147: 2571| [45] [Revealing Kazami's face on the other side.]
148: 2579| [47] [Watase]
149: 2582| [45] ["Phew..."]
150: 2590| [47] [Watase]
151: 2593| [45] ["That sure was a close call, wasn't it?"]
152: 2601| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2604| [45] ["C-Captain...!"]
154: 2612| [47] [Watase]
155: 2615| [45] ["I sure am glad I was able to react so quickly."]
156: 2623| [47] [Watase]
157: 2626| [45] ["Actually, this isn't all that easy of a feat for this Watase Kasasagi guy's body to pull off."]
158: 2671| [45] [Kazami suddenly smiled when she heard that.]
159: 2679| [47] [Kazami]
160: 2682| [45] ["Even with amnesia, you really still are our captain, aren't you...?"]
161: 2690| [47] [Watase]
162: 2693| [45] ["Looks that way... but you can thank me later."]
163: 2701| [47] [Watase]
164: 2704| [45] ["I'm going to pull you up, so give me your hand."]
165: 2712| [47] [Kazami]
166: 2715| [45] ["Yes..."]
167: 2720| [45] [Watase grabbed onto Kazami's hands and pulled her up in one great big motion.]
168: 2782| [47] [Kazami]
169: 2785| [45] ["Th-thank you very much..."]
170: 2793| [47] [Watase]
171: 2796| [45] ["You're not hurt, are you?"]
172: 2804| [47] [Kazami]
173: 2807| [45] ["N-no..."]
174: 2815| [47] [Watase]
175: 2818| [45] ["I see. Thank God. But..."]
176: 2823| [45] [Watase looked at the now partially collapsed passageway.]
177: 2831| [47] [Watase]
178: 2834| [45] ["I guess Area 6 got damaged really badly by that fire."]
179: 2860| [47] [Kazami]
180: 2863| [45] ["Indeed... I wonder if the others are all right?"]
181: 2871| [47] [Watase]
182: 2874| [45] ["Let's get back to them and make sure."]
183: 2879| [45] [Watase and Kazami then broke off into a dash.]
