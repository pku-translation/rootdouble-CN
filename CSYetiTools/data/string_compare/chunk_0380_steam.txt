  0:   63| [45] [--It appeared those were the only memories that had possibly been altered.]
  1:   87| [47] [Yuuri]
  2:   90| [45] [{... Don't you find it a bit surprising how few memories had been falsified...?}]
  3:   95| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   96| [45] [(Mmm, that's true... and it's not like the altered memories were all that terrible.)]
  5:  101| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  102| [45] [(But anyway, Ms. Tachibana should go back to her normal self if there are no more problems with her memories...)]
  7:  108| [45] [--Natsuhiko rechecked all the memories that could have possibly been altered.]
  8:  113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  114| [45] [(Maybe something different will happen this time?)]
 10:  132| [45] [He carefully looked through the memories, but it appeared there weren't any more in need of repair.]
 11:  156| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  159| [45] [{... Yes, it looks all right. The memory repair is all done.}]
 13:  164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  165| [45] [(Yeah. But there's still something we have to take care of first.)]
 15:  170| [45] [--Erasing the spirit of Subject N that haunted Kazami's brain.]
 16:  194| [47] [Yuuri]
 17:  197| [45] [{It looks like Ms. Tachibana's mind has been considerably corroded...}]
 18:  202| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  205| [45] [{Perhaps it's due more to the direct effects of the malice transmitted by N rather than any memory manipulation?}]
 20:  210| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  211| [45] [(I can't think of any other possibilities.)]
 22:  216| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  217| [45] [(Okay then... it's time for the final battle! Let's go!)]
 24:  241| [47] [Yuuri]
 25:  244| [45] [{Yes!}]
 26:  269| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  272| [45] [{No... I don't feel like the memories have been repaired enough.}]
 28:  277| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  278| [45] [(I see...)]
 30:  302| [47] [Yuuri]
 31:  305| [45] [{Focus carefully and try one more time.}]
