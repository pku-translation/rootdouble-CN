  0:   87| [45] [--Inside that memory was Natsuhiko himself in his childhood days.]
  1:   92| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   93| [45] [(When... is this memory from...?)]
  3:   98| [45] [Once he pondered that question, a date just popped into Natsuhiko's head.]
  4:  103| [45] [He naturally knew just when that event happened, as if he were recalling his own memories.]
  5:  108| [45] ["July 7, 2021"]
  6:  113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  114| [45] [(...!? Wait, that date...)]
  8:  119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  120| [45] [(This is Mashiro's memory of right before Yuuri and I went to LABO!?)]
 10:  125| [45] [Inside the memory, "Natsuhiko" and "Mashiro" spoke.]
 11:  164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  167| [45] ["--We're going to LABO to save Mom."]
 13:  172| [45] [Mashiro's eyes opened wide at those words.]
 14:  177| [47] [Mashiro]
 15:  180| [45] ["Stop it, Natsuhiko! It's dangerous! You shouldn't go to a place like that!"]
 16:  206| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  209| [45] ["Why not?"]
 18:  214| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  217| [45] ["There are rumors that they do dangerous research there, you know..."]
 20:  222| [47] [Mashiro]
 21:  225| [45] ["And besides, 'ra-di-ation' comes outta there, so you can't ever go inside! Dad told me so!"]
 22:  251| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  254| [45] ["Huh, what's wrong, Mashiro? You chicken? Well fine, I guess I'll just go ask Yuuri then~"]
 24:  259| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  262| [45] ["... What's that supposed to mean!? Lately you've been Yuuri this and Yuuri that...!"]
 26:  267| [45] [Mashiro loved Yuuri too, and thought of her as a close friend despite their age difference.]
 27:  272| [45] [But for some reason, Mashiro didn't like it whenever Natsuhiko said Yuuri's name.]
 28:  298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  301| [45] ["What? Don't tell me you're jealous? But you're just a tomboy."]
 30:  306| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  309| [45] ["...!"]
 32:  314| [45] [She could feel her cheeks turn red.]
 33:  319| [45] [As the blood rushed to her head--]
 34:  324| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  327| [45] ["Fine, I don't care about you anymore, Natsuhiko! Go buzz off with Yuuri and see if I care!"]
 36:  332| [45] [--Mashiro ended up yelling those words.]
 37:  337| [45] [Those words she would later come to regret for years and years...]
 38:  407| [45] [And after that, Natsuhiko and Yuuri went to LABO.]
 39:  412| [45] [Mashiro had no idea what happened there.]
 40:  477| [45] [--Three days later.]
 41:  482| [45] [Mashiro came to the park by herself.]
 42:  487| [45] [She thought it was about time for her to make up with Natsuhiko.]
 43:  492| [45] [She was going to apologize when she saw him at school, but neither Natsuhiko nor Yuuri had attended since the day before yesterday, so she never had a chance.]
 44:  497| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  498| [45] [(That was just another one of our little fights, right...? Things will be back to normal after we play for a day, won't they?)]
 46:  503| [45] [When she and Natsuhiko played alone, neither ever yielded, but whenever Yuuri was with them, things would be okay.]
 47:  508| [45] [If Yuuri were there to bind them together, then they'd definitely be able to make up soon.]
 48:  513| [45] [And with that plan in mind, Mashiro waited--]
 49:  518| [45] [But Natsuhiko just wasn't coming, it seemed.]
 50:  523| [45] [Even though he almost always showed up around this time.]
 51:  528| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  529| [45] ["..."]
 53:  534| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  537| [45] ["Should I go to Natsuhiko's place...?"]
 55:  542| [45] [Eventually, Mashiro muttered that and walked off.]
 56:  637| [45] [Once she reached Natsuhiko's house, she tried pressing the doorbell.]
 57:  648| [45] [But nobody came.]
 58:  677| [45] [There was no response no matter how many times she pushed the button.]
 59:  682| [47] [Mashiro]
 60:  685| [45] ["... That's strange."]
 61:  690| [47] [Mashiro]
 62:  693| [45] ["Excuse me~? Is anybody home~?"]
 63:  698| [45] [The moment she spoke up-- she heard a voice from behind her.]
 64:  703| [47] [???]
 65:  706| [45] ["... Mashiro?"]
 66:  823| [45] [She turned around in shock to see Natsuhiko's mother, Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa, standing there.]
 67:  828| [47] [Mashiro]
 68:  831| [45] ["Ah, Professor."]
 69:  836| [45] [When Mashiro called her by that name, the professor spoke to her in a tired voice.]
 70:  862| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  865| [45] ["... What's wrong?"]
 72:  870| [47] [Mashiro]
 73:  873| [45] ["Umm, I came here to see Natsuhiko, but he doesn't seem to be in."]
 74:  878| [47] [Mashiro]
 75:  881| [45] ["Where did he go?"]
 76:  904| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  905| [45] ["..."]
 78:  913| [47] [Miyoko]
 79:  916| [45] ["... You haven't heard yet, have you..."]
 80:  921| [47] [Mashiro]
 81:  924| [45] ["Heard what?"]
 82:  950| [47] [Miyoko]
 83:  953| [45] ["... Natsuhiko is in the hospital."]
 84:  958| [47] [Mashiro]
 85:  961| [45] ["Hospital!?"]
 86:  969| [47] [Miyoko]
 87:  972| [45] ["There was a fire at LABO, and he and Yuuri got caught in it..."]
 88:  977| [47] [Mashiro]
 89:  980| [45] ["W-was he hospitalized?"]
 90:  985| [47] [Mashiro]
 91:  988| [45] ["Yuuri was with him... so is Yuuri in the hospital too!?"]
 92: 1014| [47] [Miyoko]
 93: 1017| [45] ["... Yuuri's... no longer with us."]
 94: 1022| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1025| [45] ["...?"]
 96: 1077| [45] [With a dark expression on her face, the professor stepped up to Mashiro-- %Nand held her by the shoulders as she spoke slowly.]
 97: 1085| [47] [Miyoko]
 98: 1088| [45] ["Mashiro... You see, after she was rescued..."]
 99: 1096| [47] [Miyoko]
100: 1099| [45] ["... Yuuri never woke up..."]
101: 1107| [47] [Miyoko]
102: 1110| [45] ["And last night...!"]
103: 1115| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1118| [45] ["... Huh?"]
105: 1129| [45] [--The moment she heard those words--]
106: 1134| [45] [Mashiro felt her peaceful days come crashing to an end.]
