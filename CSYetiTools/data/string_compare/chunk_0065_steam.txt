  1:   66| [45] [The security slot for the gate from the outer ring on B2 of Area 4 to Area 5 had been burned, but--]
  2:   71| [45] [When it came to the other way around, the security slot was totally intact.]
  3:   76| [45] [So Watase's group used that route to get into Area 4.]
  4:  126| [45] [Area 4, outer ring, B2--]
  5:  131| [45] [The area where Salyu had run off, where the flashover had nearly killed Watase, Kazami, and Jun, and where they'd found Hiyama's body.]
  6:  136| [45] [The reading on the Procyon read "6610 mSv".]
  7:  145| [47] [Watase]
  8:  148| [45] ["The contamination is much worse than it was before...!"]
  9:  210| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  213| [45] ["But we've got AD, so we should still be able to manage."]
 11:  240| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  243| [45] ["She's right. We should get the search here done as soon as we can, then move on to Area 3."]
 13:  248| [45] [--Kazami and Ukita were right.]
 14:  253| [45] [Just because they'd found a ton of AD didn't change the fact they were short on time.]
 15:  258| [47] [Watase]
 16:  259| [45] [(We need to be more careful to make sure we don't waste any time from this point onwards...)]
 17:  264| [45] [Watase thought for a moment, then spoke up.]
 18:  272| [47] [Watase]
 19:  275| [45] ["Then let's commence the search! You all have three minutes!"]
 20:  283| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  286| [45] ["Yes!"]
 22:  329| [45] [The team immediately began to search the outer ring.]
 23:  334| [45] [But there weren't that many rooms, so the search probably wouldn't take all that long.]
 24:  339| [45] [Watase ran down the hallway and headed for the elevator hall.]
 25:  382| [45] [For the room where Hiyama's body had been put to rest. But as he drew near--]
 26:  431| [47] [Watase]
 27:  434| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
 28:  439| [45] [Watase's eyes widened. He could tell something was off.]
 29:  444| [47] [Watase]
 30:  445| [45] [(It's like something that should be here isn't...!)]
 31:  450| [45] [He soon realized what it was.]
 32:  512| [45] [The group had put the fire axe that had been by Hiyama's body in front of the door as a grave marker of sorts, but--]
 33:  576| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  579| [45] ["The axe is gone!?"]
 35:  587| [47] [Kazami]
 36:  590| [45] ["That can't be... Why...!?"]
 37:  598| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  601| [45] ["D-did someone take it...?"]
 39:  606| [45] [The group had been together the whole time.]
 40:  611| [45] [Meaning it couldn't have been anyone else but one of the three survivors.]
 41:  616| [47] [Watase]
 42:  617| [45] [(No wait... couldn't Yuuri have done it too...?)]
 43:  622| [45] [Now that Yuuri had run away, they couldn't say for sure that she couldn't have come here and taken the axe.]
 44:  627| [47] [Watase]
 45:  628| [45] [(But what would they want with an axe...?)]
 46:  633| [45] [Watase had no idea.]
 47:  638| [45] [But he had a horrible feeling about all this.]
 48:  646| [47] [Watase]
 49:  649| [45] ["A-anyway... let's keep searching."]
 50:  657| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  660| [45] ["Y-yes."]
 52:  665| [45] [The group said that, then resumed the search.]
 53:  708| [45] [But their efforts were as fruitless as they'd predicted.]
 54:  713| [45] [They went to go search B1 next.]
 55:  757| [45] [Area 4, outer ring, B1.]
 56:  762| [45] [Going up a flight didn't stop the Procyon's alarm, of course.]
 57:  767| [45] [The reading was--"4612 mSv".]
 58:  775| [47] [Watase]
 59:  778| [45] ["... Still, there's a huge difference between B2 and B1. huh?"]
 60:  840| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  843| [45] ["But for all we know, this place could become just as contaminated. Let's search while we still can."]
 62:  870| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  873| [45] ["R-right."]
 64:  878| [45] [Watase's team grouped up and searched B1.]
 65:  922| [45] [They didn't find any survivors in the outer ring.]
 66:  927| [45] [And the situation in the inner ring was no different.]
 67:  932| [45] [Yuuri and the others were nowhere to be seen in the control room.]
 68:  983| [45] [They also checked the Area 5 connecting passageway to be safe.]
 69:  988| [45] [The ceiling had collapsed there, leaving them unable to proceed.]
 70: 1050| [47] [Ukita]
 71: 1053| [45] ["It would appear they aren't here either, huh..."]
 72: 1061| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1064| [45] ["Yeah, but..."]
 74: 1069| [45] [Watase was curious about the collapsed ceiling.]
 75: 1123| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1126| [45] ["Are we sure that the gap in the ceiling there doesn't go on up to the surface?"]
 77: 1153| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1156| [45] ["Highly unlikely. Moribe and I already checked these kinds of gaps thoroughly--"]
 79: 1182| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1185| [45] ["And besides, if there -were- a hole to the surface, the Commander and the others would have used it to get down here ages ago."]
 81: 1190| [45] [Kazami's words made sense.]
 82: 1205| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1208| [45] ["I see... Yeah, I guess there was no way we'd conveniently find an escape route in a place like this."]
 84: 1235| [45] [But Watase put her opinion aside.]
 85: 1243| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1246| [45] ["I'm gonna go check just to be safe. Wait here a sec!"]
 87: 1272| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1275| [45] ["Ah, Captain!"]
 89: 1280| [45] [Watase climbed the mountain of debris and entered the gap in the ceiling.]
 90: 1328| [45] [--But it wasn't as deep as it looked.]
 91: 1333| [45] [Inside the hole was what appeared to be a thick metal plate that made going any higher impossible.]
 92: 1338| [45] [Watase tried pounding on it really hard, but it didn't budge an inch.]
 93: 1343| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1344| [45] [(It's probably made of the same stuff as the bulkheads...)]
 95: 1349| [45] [The Commander had said that they were steel plates that not even an explosion could destroy. Then it appeared they were out of luck on this end.]
 96: 1354| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1355| [45] [(But the ceiling collapsed. So maybe there's cracks in the steel plates too?)]
 98: 1360| [45] [Watase felt about the steel plates in the darkness to see if he could find anything--]
 99: 1365| [45] [But he had no success no matter how hard he looked.]
100: 1370| [47] [Watase]
101: 1371| [45] [(... Guess this is a total dead end.)]
102: 1376| [45] [Watase finally gave up and climbed back down the debris.]
103: 1459| [47] [Watase]
104: 1462| [45] ["Tch, it really is impossible."]
105: 1470| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1473| [45] ["Figured. That was just a waste of time."]
107: 1481| [47] [Kazami]
108: 1484| [45] ["Unfortunately... Moribe and I already checked all the places that looked like they could be escape routes, as I believe I mentioned earlier."]
109: 1492| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1495| [45] ["That included the ceilings, air ducts, elevator shafts, and emergency staircases. They're all surrounded by those steel plates, and none of them have even a scratch on them."]
111: 1503| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1506| [45] ["We may have overlooked one... but let's put priority on finding the survivors for now."]
113: 1514| [47] [Watase]
114: 1517| [45] ["... Yeah. Then let's go on to Area 3."]
115: 1522| [45] [Watase and the rest of the team then left the connecting passageway.]
