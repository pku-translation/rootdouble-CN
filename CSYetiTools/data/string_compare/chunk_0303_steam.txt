  0:   53| [45] [--It was a memory of Watase at the ruins of the hospital--]
  1:   58| [45] [The memory of the time when Ukita had told him the truth behind the Great Rokumei City Arson.]
  2:  114| [45] [--The man explained it all to Watase.]
  3:  119| [45] [All about how that unprecedented incident had been caused by a single woman known as "Communicator A".]
  4:  124| [45] [And how A was lured in by Rokumei City and joined the PRC as a test subject--]
  5:  131| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  132| [45] [(So this is it... This is a memory that's been altered.)]
  7:  137| [45] [He remembered the gist of what Ukita had said.]
  8:  192| [45] ["Communicator A was the worst criminal there was. And yet the PRC developed her abilities."]
  9:  197| [45] ["As a result, her malice-laced thoughts were released and caused the Great Arson."]
 10:  238| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  239| [45] [(... So is there a part of his story that's been altered...?)]
 12:  244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  245| [45] [(Then what's the truth!?)]
 14:  250| [45] [Natsuhiko tried repairing the memory with that thought in mind.]
 15:  273| [45] [--The man continued as Watase reeled in shock.]
 16:  281| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  284| [45] ["But the PRC discovered the underlying mechanisms of telepathy and empathy through their study of A."]
 18:  339| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  342| [45] ["And through all those experiments, A's own BC abilities developed and grew stronger."]
 20:  350| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  353| [45] ["She became able to use telepathy and empathy freely, their effective ranges grew wider, and her power just kept on growing on and on with no end in sight."]
 22:  361| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  364| [45] ["But if that was all there'd been to it, there wouldn't have been any problems."]
 24:  372| [47] [Ukita]
 25:  375| [45] ["The problem was..."]
 26:  413| [45] [--A floral scent drifted from somewhere at that moment--]
 27:  556| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  557| [45] [(This is it! This is the part I have to repair!)]
 29:  562| [45] [And with that thought, Natsuhiko sent deep affection for Communicators to Watase's heart.]
 30:  704| [45] [When he did, the false memory faded--]
 31:  754| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  757| [45] ["... that A was both the strongest Communicator there was and the worst criminal there was."]
 33:  795| [47] [Watase]
 34:  798| [45] ["... What's this?"]
 35:  836| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  839| [45] ["This is a French gossip magazine article about an incident that occurred in A's hometown in February 2014."]
 37:  906| [45] [--and the lies were replaced with the truth.]
 38:  930| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  933| [45] ["... that A harbored a deep 'malice' in her mind."]
 40:  941| [47] [Watase]
 41:  944| [45] ["Malice...?"]
 42:  952| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  955| [45] ["Yes. All sorts of negative emotions such as resentment, hatred, and rage. They then shifted into malice for others--"]
 44:  963| [47] [Ukita]
 45:  966| [45] ["And A's life was so tragic that it filled her heart."]
 46:  971| [45] [The screen on the PDA then changed when the man said that.]
 47: 1049| [45] [It appeared to be a magazine article written in a foreign language.]
 48: 1057| [47] [Watase]
 49: 1060| [45] ["... What's this?"]
 50: 1068| [47] [Ukita]
 51: 1071| [45] ["This is a French gossip magazine article about an incident that occurred in A's hometown in February 2014."]
 52: 1079| [47] [Ukita]
 53: 1082| [45] ["Discrimination against Communicators was fervent at the time in that country, so it appears that A, with her especially tremendous power, was ostracized horribly by the people around her."]
 54: 1090| [47] [Ukita]
 55: 1093| [45] ["In particular, she was publicly ostracized by a recently established local religious sect--"]
 56: 1101| [47] [Ukita]
 57: 1104| [45] ["A, with her seemingly incomprehensible abilities, was likely viewed as a servant of the Devil by them."]
 58: 1112| [47] [Ukita]
 59: 1115| [45] ["Therefore, they caused the incident described in the article before you: they set fire to A's house."]
 60: 1124| [47] [Watase]
 61: 1127| [45] ["... How inhuman."]
 62: 1136| [47] [Ukita]
 63: 1139| [45] ["Indeed. But the real inhumanity came after that."]
 64: 1147| [47] [Ukita]
 65: 1150| [45] ["This is just a guess of mine-- but I'd say that after A became a part of the PRC, it's likely she..."]
 66: 1158| [47] [Ukita]
 67: 1161| [45] ["Was confined and made into a test subject for human experimentation."]
 68: 1169| [47] [Watase]
 69: 1172| [45] ["What!?"]
 70: 1180| [47] [Ukita]
 71: 1183| [45] ["It's very likely when you consider the achievements of the PRC back in those days."]
 72: 1191| [47] [Ukita]
 73: 1194| [45] ["She fled to Japan to escape persecution only to encounter even more suffering... causing the malice in her heart to amplify further."]
 74: 1202| [47] [Ukita]
 75: 1205| [45] ["Despite that, the PRC developed her abilities even further... without ever realizing the true danger they possessed."]
 76: 1213| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1216| [45] ["What was so dangerous about them?"]
 78: 1224| [47] [Ukita]
 79: 1227| [45] ["You don't know? BC-- telepathy, that is, isn't just the ability to send your voice to a faraway person."]
 80: 1235| [47] [Ukita]
 81: 1238| [45] ["You can also send your feelings to others with it."]
 82: 1246| [47] [Ukita]
 83: 1249| [45] ["In other words, powerful BC could very well change other people's thoughts."]
 84: 1257| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1260| [45] ["So what do you think would happen if someone who had been turned into malice incarnate like A were to indiscriminately let her thoughts loose on everyone around her?"]
 86: 1268| [47] [Ukita]
 87: 1271| [45] ["Those thoughts would bring out the 'malice' that lurks in the hearts of every man."]
 88: 1279| [47] [Ukita]
 89: 1282| [45] ["Her malice would spread to everyone around her like a virulent disease."]
 90: 1290| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1293| [45] ["... Now you understand just how dangerous it is, don't you?"]
 92: 1316| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1319| [45] ["...!"]
 94: 1324| [45] [Watase was rendered speechless.]
 95: 1329| [45] [He just silently continued to listen to the man.]
 96: 1337| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1340| [45] ["... However, A is not at fault. Much of the fault lies in the PRC for exploiting her abilities without even considering the consequences."]
 98: 1348| [47] [Ukita]
 99: 1351| [45] ["The researchers at the PRC took that poor woman and raised her to become a monster."]
100: 1359| [47] [Ukita]
101: 1362| [45] ["The researchers realized how dangerous A was far too late and set up surveillance to keep her from wandering out into the city--"]
102: 1370| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1373| [45] ["But on September 16th, 2014, A escaped from the facility."]
104: 1381| [47] [Watase]
105: 1384| [45] ["Escaped... then you mean she...!"]
106: 1517| [47] [Ukita]
107: 1520| [45] ["Yes, A spread her malice-laced thoughts all throughout the city that night."]
108: 1528| [47] [Ukita]
109: 1531| [45] ["Those thoughts influenced the minds of the people of Rokumei City in some way."]
110: 1539| [47] [Ukita]
111: 1542| [45] ["This caused the already high levels of malice held by would-be criminals to spike through the roof--"]
112: 1674| [47] [Ukita]
113: 1677| [45] ["And led them to setting the city on fire."]
114: 1685| [47] [Ukita]
115: 1688| [45] ["This is the truth behind the 'Great Rokumei City Arson'."]
116: 1693| [45] [The man declared all of that in a clear voice.]
117: 1732| [47] [Watase]
118: 1733| [45] [(... It can't be...!?)]
119: 1738| [47] [Watase]
120: 1739| [45] [(Rokumei City and the PRC did all of that...!?)]
121: 1773| [45] [--Natsuhiko gasped when he'd finished viewing that memory.]
122: 1828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1829| [45] [(So it's still true that Communicator A was the real cause of the Great Rokumei City Arson...)]
124: 1834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1835| [45] [(... but she wasn't the "worst criminal there was" at all!?)]
126: 1887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1888| [45] [(It was the PRC and persecution from others that turned her into malice incarnate!?)]
128: 1940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1941| [45] [(No, it was also the doing of the PRC's governing body, the Rokumei City government...!)]
130: 1958| [45] [Then that meant that Watase's hatred should be directed at the PRC and Rokumei City instead of Communicator A.]
131: 1963| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1964| [45] [(... I hope these repairs are enough to lessen Watase's hatred of us a little...)]
133: 1969| [45] [Natsuhiko thought that as he left the memory...]
134: 1996| [45] [--The repairs to the memory were all done.]
135: 2002| [45] [Natsuhiko left the memory with a mental sigh of relief...]
136: 2032| [47] [Ukita]
137: 2035| [45] ["... that A was both the strongest Communicator there was and the worst criminal there was."]
138: 2040| [45] [The screen on the PDA then changed when the man said that.]
139: 2118| [45] [It appeared to be a magazine article written in a foreign language.]
140: 2126| [47] [Watase]
141: 2129| [45] ["... What's this?"]
142: 2137| [47] [Ukita]
143: 2140| [45] ["This is a French gossip magazine article about an incident that occurred in A's hometown in February 2014."]
144: 2148| [47] [Ukita]
145: 2151| [45] ["A, with her tremendous power, was ostracized by the people around her."]
146: 2159| [47] [Ukita]
147: 2162| [45] ["So one day... she set fire to her town to slaughter those who had ostracized her."]
148: 2170| [47] [Ukita]
149: 2173| [45] ["... In other words, A was simply malice incarnate-- a woman who, on a whim, tried to massacre every person in the city."]
150: 2181| [47] [Ukita]
151: 2184| [45] ["She was pursued by the French authorities, but before they could catch her, she fled to Japan and was sheltered by the PRC."]
152: 2192| [47] [Ukita]
153: 2195| [45] ["Luckily for her, the PRC developed her BC abilities... without ever realizing the true danger they possessed."]
154: 2203| [47] [Watase]
155: 2206| [45] ["What was so dangerous about them?"]
156: 2214| [47] [Ukita]
157: 2217| [45] ["You don't know? BC-- telepathy, that is, isn't just the ability to send your voice to a faraway person."]
158: 2225| [47] [Ukita]
159: 2228| [45] ["You can also send your feelings to others with it."]

162: 2247| [47] [Watase]
163: 2250| [45] ["Ah...!"]
164: 2258| [47] [Ukita]
165: 2261| [45] ["So what do you think would happen if someone filled with as much malice as A were to indiscriminately let her thoughts loose on everyone around her?"]
166: 2269| [47] [Ukita]
167: 2272| [45] ["Those thoughts would bring out the 'malice' that lurks in the hearts of every man."]
168: 2280| [47] [Ukita]
169: 2283| [45] ["Her malice would spread to everyone around her like a virulent disease."]
170: 2291| [47] [Ukita]
171: 2294| [45] ["... Now you understand just how dangerous it is, don't you?"]
172: 2317| [47] [Watase]
173: 2320| [45] ["...!"]
174: 2325| [45] [Watase was rendered speechless.]
175: 2330| [45] [He just silently continued to listen to the man.]
176: 2338| [47] [Ukita]
177: 2341| [45] ["The researchers at the PRC raised an ordinary criminal into a bona-fide monster."]
178: 2349| [47] [Ukita]
179: 2352| [45] ["The researchers realized how dangerous A was far too late and set up surveillance to keep her from wandering out into the city--"]
180: 2360| [47] [Ukita]
181: 2363| [45] ["But on September 16th, 2014, A escaped from the facility."]

198: 2729| [45] [(He's saying a single woman became the trigger behind the incident...!?)]
199: 2777| [45] [--The memory was no different from the last time--]
200: 2782| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 2783| [45] [(Did I fail the repair job...?)]
202: 2788| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2789| [45] [(Do I have to strengthen his favor for Communicators more?)]
204: 2794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2795| [45] [(I should strengthen his favor for those he thinks of as Communicators as much as possible...)]
206: 2800| [45] [Turning his attention elsewhere, Natsuhiko left the memory for the time being...]
