  1:   62| [45] [--Meanwhile, Natsuhiko--]
  2:  109| [45] [--was in the shelter with Yuuri. The two of them were gazing at Mashiro's face.]
  3:  114| [45] [Mashiro was groaning in pain.]
  4:  122| [47] [Mashiro]
  5:  125| [45] ["U-ugh....!"]
  6:  133| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  136| [45] ["Mashiron looks like she's in pain, huh..."]
  8:  144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  147| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 10:  152| [45] [Natsuhiko was frustrated at being powerless to help her.]
 11:  157| [45] [There were so many things he wanted to talk about when she woke up.]
 12:  162| [45] [He wanted to tell her that Yuuri was alive.]
 13:  216| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  217| [45] [(... Hey, Mashiro. This must have been how you felt nine years ago, huh...)]
 15:  222| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  223| [45] [(This is what it must have felt like to watch me stupefied, unable to wake up.)]
 17:  262| [45] [That incident had shattered their daily lives.]
 18:  267| [45] [Natsuhiko became stupefied once he was told of Yuuri's death, and when he woke up,%Nhe started to see a phantom--]
 19:  272| [45] [The three kids who had once been together had become distanced in many ways.]
 20:  277| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  278| [45] [(But after such a long time, we're finally all together again. And yet...)]
 22:  283| [45] [Mashiro had watched over Natsuhiko until his time of awakening came. And now, Mashiro was the one lying down, wakeless.]
 23:  288| [45] [What if, before Mashiro woke up--]
 24:  293| [45] [Watase handed Yuuri over to Q and she was taken away somewhere?]
 25:  298| [45] [Those two best friends might never meet again.]
 26:  344| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  347| [45] ["... Yuuri, are you sure you're okay with it?"]
 28:  373| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  376| [45] ["You mean the deal with Captain Kasasagi?"]
 30:  384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  387| [45] ["Yeah. At this rate, that might mean you'll have to part with Mashiro too, you know?"]
 32:  395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  398| [45] ["Just how sad would it make her to hear about everything after the fact...?"]
 34:  403| [45] [Yuuri suddenly sighed in reply.]
 35:  429| [47] [Yuuri]
 36:  432| [45] ["You know, Hikorin... I'm sure it might make Mashiron sad, but sadness is only temporary, you know?"]
 37:  440| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  443| [45] ["Huh?"]
 39:  469| [47] [Yuuri]
 40:  472| [45] ["Well, I'm sure she'll have mixed feelings about knowing that I'm alive."]
 41:  480| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  483| [45] ["Wh-why's that!?"]
 43:  540| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  543| [45] ["Why's that...? You can't tell me you haven't noticed it, can you? Mashiron really loves you,%Nyou know?"]
 45:  551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  554| [45] ["..."]
 47:  609| [47] [Yuuri]
 48:  612| [45] ["She loves you so much, she risked her life to come with you all the way to LABO."]
 49:  645| [47] [Yuuri]
 50:  648| [45] ["But if I were to suddenly appear and steal you away after all of that, then even Mashiron would get mad."]
 51:  656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  659| [45] ["H-hey, hold on, Yuuri..."]
 53:  685| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  688| [45] ["Of course, the deal with Captain Kasasagi was to ensure everyone got saved. But it's also a good opportunity for me to back off, too."]
 55:  714| [47] [Yuuri]
 56:  717| [45] ["With me out of the way, you and Mashiron can be together. Yeah. So it really is the best course of--"]
 57:  725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  728| [45] ["What are you saying, idiot?"]
 59:  733| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't bear to listen anymore, so he interrupted her.]
 60:  759| [47] [Yuuri]
 61:  762| [45] ["I-... idiot!?"]
 62:  767| [45] [Yuuri's eyes widened.]
 63:  772| [45] [It was understandable. That was the very first time Natsuhiko had ever badmouthed her.]
 64:  777| [45] [But nonetheless, Natsuhiko hardened his heart and continued.]
 65:  785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  788| [45] ["... Yuuri, don't you know? Don't you know just how much Mashiro loved you?"]
 67:  796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  799| [45] ["Do you know how much it pained her heart to learn that you had died?"]
 69:  825| [47] [Yuuri]
 70:  828| [45] ["But... that was ages ago."]
 71:  836| [47] [Yuuri]
 72:  839| [45] ["Who cares about a dead friend who's been gone for nine whole years?"]
 73:  865| [47] [Yuuri]
 74:  868| [45] ["Besides, Mashiron's a way, way, more amazing girl than me..."]
 75:  876| [47] [Yuuri]
 76:  879| [45] ["There's no way a girl like her would care about someone like me forever..."]
 77:  887| [47] [Yuuri]
 78:  890| [45] ["After all, Mashiron's so cute, and cheerful, and popular with all the boys--"]
 79:  898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  901| [45] ["None of that matters to her, and you know it, don't you?"]
 81:  924| [47] [Yuuri]
 82:  925| [45] ["..."]
 83:  930| [45] [Yuuri pouted her lips.]
 84:  935| [45] [It was a conversation nine years in the making.]
 85:  940| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri were speaking not through BC, but with their own voices. Not through lies and falsehoods, but from the heart.]
 86:  997| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1000| [45] ["... Mashiro would always communicate with you through me."]
 88: 1008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1011| [45] ["You're not just some '9-year-dead friend' to her at all."]
 90: 1019| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1022| [45] ["She still cares about you. There's no way in hell that Mashiro would be upset to learn you're alive."]
 92: 1030| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1033| [45] ["So please stop this nonsense about backing off for Mashiro's sake... I'm sure that's actually the one thing she'd hate the most."]
 94: 1066| [47] [Yuuri]
 95: 1069| [45] ["... But..."]
 96: 1074| [45] [Yuuri looked more and more confused.]
 97: 1079| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed.]
 98: 1087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1090| [45] ["... Say, Yuuri. Can you please drop the mindset that 'it's okay if I suffer as long as nobody else has to'?"]
100: 1116| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1119| [45] ["Huh?"]
102: 1127| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1130| [45] ["I'm not just talking about the thing with Mashiro. You're like that with Watase's deal too."]
104: 1138| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1141| [45] ["You were confined here for nine years, and at the end of all of that, you fall into Q's hands... You're not okay with that, are you?"]
106: 1149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1152| [45] ["I don't want you to go through that again. I want to set you free."]
108: 1157| [45] [Once Natsuhiko had said all that-- Yuuri smiled ever so slightly.]
109: 1183| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1186| [45] ["... If only."]
111: 1194| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1197| [45] ["If only I could go outside, bask in the light of the sun, and walk freely in the park... I'm sure it'd be fun."]
113: 1223| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1226| [45] ["If only I could go on a trip somewhere with you, and Mashiron, and Salyu, and the professor too."]
115: 1234| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1237| [45] ["Then--"]
117: 1242| [45] [Yuuri interrupted Natsuhiko when he tried to speak.]
118: 1268| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1271| [45] ["But I can't."]
120: 1279| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1282| [45] ["Even if we disregard Mashiron's feelings, I really still can't be with you guys."]
122: 1290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1293| [45] ["Wh... why not?"]
124: 1319| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1322| [45] ["Because I'm a test subject. LABO has their eye on me."]
126: 1345| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1348| [45] ["...!"]
128: 1374| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1377| [45] ["You don't know just how frightening LABO can be."]
130: 1385| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 1388| [45] ["They're an institution that's confined people for years on end, you know? They could even be above the police for all we know."]
132: 1414| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 1417| [45] ["Even if you stood against LABO as an individual, you'd have no chance to succeed, Hikorin.%NOnly organizations can oppose organizations..."]
134: 1443| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1446| [45] ["So you see, that's why... if I want to leave here, then I have no choice but to let Q take custody of me."]
136: 1451| [45] [Natsuhiko was speechless in light of Yuuri's sad words.]
137: 1456| [45] [Now he understood why she had been so obstinate. She didn't want to get Natsuhiko or Mashiro involved.]
138: 1461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1462| [45] [(But still... in the end... that still means Yuuri has to endure suffering all by herself, doesn't it!?)]
140: 1467| [45] [Once that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind-- he suddenly heard a sound coming from outside the shelter door.]
141: 1501| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 1504| [45] ["!?"]
143: 1512| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1515| [45] ["Who's there!?"]
145: 1529| [47] [Watase]
146: 1532| [45] ["It's me. Please open up."]
147: 1539| [45] [It was Watase. Relieved, Natsuhiko input the password on the keypad beside the door.]
148: 1572| [45] [And soon enough, the iron door opened and Watase appeared.]
149: 1611| [47] [Watase]
150: 1614| [45] ["Look who I brought."]
151: 1619| [45] [Watase was carrying a limp Ukita under his arm.]
152: 1627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 1630| [45] ["Mr. Ukita!"]
154: 1656| [47] [Watase]
155: 1659| [45] ["Relax, he's just unconscious."]
156: 1664| [45] [Watase gently laid Ukita down on the floor.]
157: 1669| [45] [And sure enough, Ukita had not a single visible wound.]
158: 1674| [45] [Natsuhiko was unsure how exactly Watase had apprehended him, but--]
159: 1679| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 1680| [45] [(It couldn't have been easy to apprehend someone who had a gun without hurting them, could it...?)]
161: 1706| [47] [Watase]
162: 1709| [45] ["Well, now you see exactly what my stance is, don't you?"]
163: 1717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 1720| [45] ["... Watase."]
165: 1725| [45] [Watase had kept his promise with Yuuri.]
166: 1730| [45] ["Evacuate everyone safely."]
167: 1735| [45] [It seemed Watase was striving to make sure nobody got hurt during the process, either.]
168: 1740| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 1741| [45] [(Damn... I'm not sure if this guy's got integrity or what...)]
170: 1746| [45] [While Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words, Yuuri spoke for him.]
171: 1773| [47] [Yuuri]
172: 1776| [45] ["Um, Captain Kasasagi... thank you for keeping your promise."]
173: 1808| [47] [Watase]
174: 1811| [45] ["... Hmph."]
175: 1816| [45] [Watase looked uncomfortable and just turned up his nose.]
176: 1842| [47] [Watase]
177: 1845| [45] ["... Anyway, if you're gonna do it, then just do it already. That, uh, malice erasure thing."]
178: 1853| [47] [Watase]
179: 1856| [45] ["There's no doubt that the monster's screwing around inside the old man's head."]
180: 1882| [47] [Watase]
181: 1885| [45] ["He'll probably go berserk again the moment he wakes up. And that's definitely gonna be a pain."]
182: 1893| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 1896| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
184: 1901| [45] [Natsuhiko had seen a deranged Ukita up close too.]
185: 1906| [45] [He was no doubt infected with malice.]
186: 1964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 1965| [45] [(But I won't do something as crude as a full memory erasure anymore...!)]
188: 1970| [45] [That was the decision Natsuhiko had made.]
189: 1975| [45] [So he would erase "only" the malice within Ukita, in the same way he had done with Watase.]
190: 2050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2053| [45] ["... Okay. Yuuri. This time, let's start off by accessing and repairing just the 'floral-scented memories' from the get-go."]
192: 2061| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2064| [45] ["And then we'll erase Subject N's spirit."]
194: 2090| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 2093| [45] ["Huh? Are you sure? That sounds a little different from the process we used for Captain Kasasagi, though..."]
196: 2101| [47] [Natsuhiko]
197: 2104| [45] ["I want to minimize reading other people's memories to only what's absolutely necessary.%NI'm sure even Mr. Ukita wouldn't like it if we just peeked into his mind without permission, you know?"]
198: 2109| [45] [That was something Natsuhiko had been prohibiting himself from doing.]
199: 2133| [45] [But in response to that answer, Watase said--]
200: 2141| [47] [Watase]
201: 2144| [45] ["... I see. So you're prohibiting yourself from abusing your abilities, huh."]
202: 2176| [47] [Watase]
203: 2179| [45] ["I admire that intention of yours, kid... but I think it's dangerous."]
204: 2205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2208| [45] ["Dangerous? Why?"]
206: 2234| [47] [Watase]
207: 2237| [45] ["Just erasing his malice doesn't necessarily make him safe, does it?"]
208: 2245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2248| [45] ["What? Mr. Ukita's one of your comrades, isn't he? You don't believe in him?"]
210: 2274| [47] [Watase]
211: 2277| [45] ["That's not what I'm talking about. It's just, there's honestly a lot about the old man as a person that I don't understand."]
212: 2285| [47] [Watase]
213: 2288| [45] ["I know I'm not one to talk, but there's just way too much about the old man's behavior that's suspicious. Like how he tied up Yuuri."]
214: 2296| [47] [Watase]
215: 2299| [45] ["So don't you think it's worth checking out what's been driving him, just to make sure?"]
216: 2307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 2310| [45] ["Mmm..."]
218: 2315| [45] [It was a little unexpected for Watase to say such a thing despite not being a Communicator.]
219: 2320| [45] [But Yuuri spoke in support of that opinion as well.]
220: 2346| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 2349| [45] ["... Hikorin, I can understand why you'd have qualms about doing it, but don't you think it'd be best if we did a proper check of Mr. Ukita's past?"]
222: 2357| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 2360| [45] ["Huh?"]
224: 2386| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 2389| [45] ["I get the feeling that repairing the falsified memories will require as deep an understanding of Mr. Ukita as possible."]
226: 2397| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 2400| [45] ["Or else we'll have no way of knowing for sure if the memories have been properly repaired or not..."]
228: 2408| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 2411| [45] ["... That's true."]
230: 2416| [45] [Watase and Yuuri made sound arguments.]
231: 2421| [45] [Though it was important to know the dangers of his ability, it might have been more dangerous to fixate on such moral issues.]
232: 2472| [45] [Perhaps he should follow Watase's and Yuuri's suggestion.]
233: 2477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 2478| [45] [(... Everyone's lives hang on my shoulders. I can't be too careful with malice erasure here, can I...)]
235: 2484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
236: 2485| [45] [(Let's go with this procedure...)]
237: 2490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 2491| [45] [(First, we repair any of the memories altered by Subject N that are serving as the root of Mr. Ukita's malice.)]
239: 2496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 2497| [45] [(After that, we erase Subject N's "spirit".)]
241: 2558| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 2561| [45] ["... Yuuri. What 'memory access' criteria do you think I should use to erase the malice in Mr. Ukita?"]
243: 2587| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 2590| [45] ["Let's see... First, to understand Mr. Ukita's intentions, we should take a chronological look through his memories leading up to today pertaining to his 'motive for causing this terrorist attack'..."]
245: 2616| [47] [Yuuri]
246: 2619| [45] ["And then we search for 'floral scented memories' and repair them. That's what I think."]
247: 2673| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 2676| [45] ["I see. We can't repair his memories if we don't know what intentions motivated his actions, can we?"]
249: 2681| [45] [Everyone's lives hung on Natsuhiko's shoulders. He could never be too careful with malice erasure in this situation.]
250: 2739| [45] [But just how detailed of a check should he run?]
251: 2744| [45] [Should he look through Ukita's memories in detail, or only the bare minimum...?]
252: 2749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 2750| [45] [(I want to keep it to the bare minimum...)]
254: 2834| [45] [He considered that course of action for a moment, but then Natsuhiko second guessed himself.]
255: 2839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 2840| [45] [(... No, I really do want to know the details.)]
257: 2845| [47] [Natsuhiko]
258: 2846| [45] [(Why would a diligent man like Mr. Ukita dabble in terrorism...?)]
259: 2851| [45] [Natsuhiko decided to have a detailed look at Ukita's memories.]
260: 2860| [45] [Indeed. This wasn't the time to preoccupy himself with unnecessary worries.]
261: 2865| [45] [Natsuhiko decided to prioritize escape over anything else.]
262: 2873| [47] [Natsuhiko]
263: 2876| [45] ["... Okay. Let's dive into Mr. Ukita's memory then...!"]
264: 2899| [45] [As Natsuhiko held his breath in anxiety, Yuuri gently grasped his hand.]
265: 2925| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 2928| [45] ["Hikorin, I'm here for you..."]
267: 2952| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded at her words, walked up to Ukita--]
268: 3012| [45] [--and activated Senses Sympathy.]
269: 3280| [85] [Malice-corrupted memories have been purified.]
270: 3624| [85] [Malice-corrupted memories have been purified.]
