  1:  118| [45] [Watase destroyed the door opening mechanism located right next to the door once he left the room.]
  2:  161| [47] [Watase]
  3:  162| [45] [(This way, Moribe and the old man can't get into the room... and Teach will be safe.)]
  4:  167| [45] [The auditory hallucination then returned with a vengeance.]
  5:  225| [85] [{Hey, answer me! Why did you knock Prof. Tsubakiyama out!?}]
  6:  226| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
  7:  227| [86] [{Hey, answer me! Why did you knock Prof. Tsubakiyama out!?}]
  8:  242| [85] [{What the hell are you trying to do!?}]
  9:  243| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 10:  244| [86] [{What the hell are you trying to do!?}]
 11:  272| [47] [Watase]
 12:  273| [45] [(Heh... I -really- must be a lunatic if I'm going to actually answer an auditory hallucination...)]
 13:  278| [45] [Watase laughed bitterly, then answered the hallucination.]
 14:  286| [47] [Watase]
 15:  289| [45] ["... There's no point in trying to persuade Moribe and the old man. Worse, we all only have an hour left."]
 16:  297| [47] [Watase]
 17:  300| [45] ["But even so... there's still just one way to save everyone."]
 18:  358| [85] [{What!?}]
 19:  359| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 20:  360| [86] [{What!?}]
 21:  388| [45] [Watase took a security card out of his pocket.]
 22:  393| [45] [It was the "Level N" card that the dead girl had on her.]
 23:  398| [45] [The only key that would open the door to Area N--.]
 24:  406| [47] [Watase]
 25:  409| [45] ["... The commander said that the security system's going haywire because of those fires burning on in Area N."]
 26:  417| [47] [Watase]
 27:  420| [45] ["So if I can put out those fires--"]
 28:  428| [47] [Watase]
 29:  431| [45] ["Then that means the security system should stabilize, and the lockdown will be lifted...!"]
 30:  488| [85] [{...!}]
 31:  489| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 32:  490| [86] [{...!}]
 33:  505| [85] [{You... you're not actually thinking of going to Area N by yourself, are you?}]
 34:  506| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 35:  507| [86] [{You... you're not actually thinking of going to Area N by yourself, are you?}]
 36:  538| [47] [Watase]
 37:  541| [45] ["Bingo."]
 38:  546| [45] [The melted down nuclear reactor was in Area N.]
 39:  551| [45] [The radiation filling that area was no doubt off the charts compared to what they were faced with out here.]
 40:  556| [45] [But in spite of that-- Watase still managed to force a smile.]
 41:  561| [47] [Watase]
 42:  562| [45] [(Hmph... so what?)]
 43:  567| [45] [What he truly feared wasn't death.]
 44:  572| [45] [It was powerlessness. To watch everything come to an end, helpless to stop it.]
 45:  577| [45] [With that thought in mind and his destination set, Watase started walking off.%NThe auditory hallucination then began to shout desperately at him.]
 46:  634| [85] [{Stop it, you dumbass! You'll die!}]
 47:  635| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 48:  636| [86] [{Stop it, you dumbass! You'll die!}]
 49:  651| [85] [{You can't put out the fire of a burning nuclear reactor all by yourself!}]
 50:  652| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 51:  653| [86] [{You can't put out the fire of a burning nuclear reactor all by yourself!}]
 52:  668| [85] [{Even if you could, you'd be exposed to radiation for sure!}]
 53:  669| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 54:  670| [86] [{Even if you could, you'd be exposed to radiation for sure!}]
 55:  698| [45] [That voice had guided Watase many a time up until now, even though he didn't know if it was his ally or his enemy.]
 56:  703| [45] [So when Watase once again heard that voice no one else knew of--]
 57:  708| [45] [He defied it.]
 58:  716| [47] [Watase]
 59:  719| [45] ["... Sorry, but I can't listen to you this time."]
 60:  727| [47] [Watase]
 61:  730| [45] ["Someone's gotta do it. Everyone's struggled hard for the last five hours, but look where that got us."]
 62:  788| [85] [{You wanna die that badly!?]
 63:  790| [85] [ Are you really okay with dying if it means saving everyone else!?}]
 64:  791| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 65:  792| [86] [{You wanna die that badly!? Are you really okay with dying if it means saving everyone else!?}]
 66:  820| [45] [The voice was growing louder and angrier.]
 67:  825| [45] [Watase answered it with a wry smile.]
 68:  833| [47] [Watase]
 69:  836| [45] ["You wouldn't understand..."]
 70:  844| [47] [Watase]
 71:  847| [45] ["It's not that I want to die. I just want to save everyone, that's all."]
 72:  904| [85] [{...?}]
 73:  905| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 74:  906| [86] [{...?}]
 75:  921| [85] [{Why are you going this far...?}]
 76:  922| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 77:  923| [86] [{Why are you going this far...?}]
 78:  951| [45] [This was the second time he'd been asked that today.]
 79: 1025| [47] [Yuuri]
 80: 1028| [45] ["--Why are you going this far to save my life?"]
 81: 1033| [45] [Watase fondly remembered that question.]
 82: 1038| [45] [It was from a time where the group had worked together to find a way to survive--%Na time before they were overtaken by discord.]
 83: 1043| [45] [Watase quietly muttered the answer he hadn't given back then.]
 84: 1080| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1083| [45] ["... Wanting to save people's been the one constant for me this whole time."]
 86: 1091| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1094| [45] ["It was all because you told me to save Yuuri way back when this all began."]
 88: 1099| [45] [Without any memories of the past, these few hours he'd spent here in LABO were Watase's entire life.]
 89: 1104| [45] [And the few memories he had recovered had been of LABO too.]
 90: 1109| [45] [This dark underground facility was the only world he knew.]
 91: 1114| [45] [Maybe he could have made a different choice if he were living peacefully.]
 92: 1119| [45] [But Watase had awoken in this facility consumed by radiation.]
 93: 1124| [45] [All while bearing the burden of his role as a rescue squad captain.]
 94: 1132| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1135| [45] ["So... all I want to do is fulfill my role."]
 96: 1143| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1146| [45] ["I hated feeling so powerless, surrounded by nothing but fire, explosions, and smoke."]
 98: 1154| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1157| [45] ["When we didn't have enough AD, I went running straight into gas and a contaminated zone."]
100: 1165| [47] [Watase]
101: 1168| [45] ["When someone fell into a hole, I grabbed their hand and pulled them out."]
102: 1176| [47] [Watase]
103: 1179| [45] ["I protected Yuuri with my body when the debris threatened to crush her..."]
104: 1187| [47] [Watase]
105: 1190| [45] ["This whole time, all I've ever thought about is how to save everyone."]
106: 1245| [85] [{...}]
107: 1246| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
108: 1247| [86] [{...}]
109: 1275| [45] [The voice went quiet.]
110: 1280| [45] [It wasn't surprising. There was no one out there who could understand Watase's feelings.]
111: 1285| [45] [He was an entity who'd suddenly been born into this hellish environment without any memories.]
112: 1290| [45] [He didn't know who he was-- only that he was a spirit bestowed with the sole duty of "saving lives"--]
113: 1295| [45] [That was him. That was Watase Kasasagi.]
114: 1300| [45] [The wounds he'd gained in the process of fulfilling that duty suddenly began hurting.]
115: 1400| [45] [His burnt left hand.]
116: 1579| [45] [His cracked ribs.]
117: 1639| [45] [The cut on the back of his head.]
118: 1698| [45] [His throat felt like it was on fire from thirst and all the vomiting he'd done, and his body was as heavy as lead from all the exhaustion he'd built up.]
119: 1703| [45] [And yet he did not stop.]
120: 1708| [45] [For his will was the only thing he could rely on now that he didn't even trust himself.]
121: 1716| [47] [Watase]
122: 1719| [45] ["... I'll be damned if I let the others die because of my actions."]
123: 1727| [47] [Watase]
124: 1730| [45] ["And the same goes for letting anyone die because I did nothing."]
125: 1738| [47] [Watase]
126: 1741| [45] ["If putting out the reactor fires will save everyone, then I'll do it."]
127: 1749| [47] [Watase]
128: 1752| [45] ["Even if..."]
129: 1757| [45] [--Even if I lose my life as a result.]
130: 1762| [45] [Perhaps the auditory hallucination had figured what he was thinking, as it spoke up in a faint voice.]
131: 1819| [85] [{.. Watase... you...}]
132: 1820| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
133: 1821| [86] [{.. Watase... you...}]
134: 1852| [47] [Watase]
135: 1855| [45] ["You get it now? If you do, then shut up."]
136: 1863| [47] [Watase]
137: 1866| [45] ["... If you keep talking, I might lose my resolve."]
138: 1871| [45] [Watase muttered that and broke off into a run.]
139: 1876| [45] [He headed for Area N, home of the burning reactor--]
140: 1985| [45] [Watase's Procyon started beeping louder than he'd ever heard it before when he opened the connecting passageway gate to Area N.]
141: 1990| [45] [The Procyon's display was giving off a reading far greater than he'd ever seen before.]
142: 1996| [47] [Watase]
143: 1999| [45] ["'12210 mSv'...!"]
144: 2005| [47] [Watase]
145: 2008| [45] ["'12110 mSv'...!"]
146: 2014| [47] [Watase]
147: 2017| [45] ["'12010 mSv'...!"]
148: 2022| [45] [He was then assaulted by an intense headache and severe nausea.]
149: 2027| [45] [His skin was numb, and his vision grew blurry.]
150: 2035| [47] [Watase]
151: 2038| [45] ["... Tch."]
152: 2082| [45] [Watase turned his Procyon off, then kept on walking.]
153: 2125| [47] [Watase]
154: 2126| [45] [(The nuclear reactor's right behind this gate...!)]
155: 2131| [45] [A melted down reactor, raging hellfire, and extremely lethal doses of radiation--]
156: 2136| [45] [Watase shuddered as he imagined that hell on Earth waiting for him right up ahead.]
157: 2141| [45] [But...]
158: 2188| [47] [Watase]
159: 2191| [45] ["... I'm ready."]
160: 2196| [45] [Watase kept himself from shaking, then pulled a hose out from the nearby fire hydrant.]
161: 2201| [45] [He held it with his left hand, with the security card in the right.]
162: 2206| [47] [Watase]
163: 2207| [45] [(Extinguishing preparations all set. Let's roll.)]
164: 2212| [45] [Though genuine danger lay just up ahead, Watase did not falter.]
165: 2217| [45] [Endless courage was coarsing through him.]
166: 2222| [45] [He suddenly broke out into a smile.]
167: 2227| [47] [Watase]
168: 2228| [45] [(Looks like I finally became... a true rescue worker.)]
169: 2233| [45] [He then took the card in his hand--]
170: 2347| [45] [And opened the gate.]
