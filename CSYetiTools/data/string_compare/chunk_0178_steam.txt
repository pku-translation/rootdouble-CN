  0:   39| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 4]
  1:   59| [45] [--In reality, Natsuhiko was standing in front of a collapsed emergency staircase.]
  2:  133| [45] [Beside him were an anxious Mashiro and a frightened Yuuri.]
  3:  138| [45] [They had gotten separated from Salyu and were searching for an escape route.]
  4:  149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  150| [45] [(...!)]
  6:  155| [45] [As he remembered what happened that fateful night, Natsuhiko ground his teeth.]
  7:  160| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  161| [45] [(I didn't believe Mashiro at first when she told me about the terrorist plot...)]
  9:  166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  167| [45] [(And this is the result of my disbelief...!)]
 11:  172| [45] [Natsuhiko was filled once again with regret. ]
 12:  177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  178| [45] [(What I need to do first... is to get Mashiro and the others out of here!)]
 14:  183| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed to the stairwell and looked up.]
 15:  188| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  189| [45] [(Is there any way at all to climb this thing!? If I can at least get Mashiro and the others out, then--)]
 17:  194| [45] [As that thought crossed his mind,]
 18:  298| [45] [a small figure appeared at the top of the stairs.]
 19:  332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  335| [45] ["Salyu!"]
 21:  340| [45] [Once Natsuhiko yelled, she looked down at them.]
 22:  348| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  351| [45] ["How'd it go!? Were you able to beat those guys!?"]
 24:  359| [47] [Salyu]
 25:  362| [45] ["... I'm sorry. It was an embarrassing defeat."]
 26:  367| [45] [As soon as she said that, Natsuhiko heard the sound of a drop of water dripping down.]
 27:  372| [45] [A red stain formed on the floor-- a stain of Salyu's blood.]
 28:  420| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  423| [45] ["Salyu, you're hurt!?"]
 30:  431| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  434| [45] ["You suffered defeat!? Don't tell me those guys...!?"]
 32:  442| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  445| [45] ["Right when I knocked those two out, another one appeared, and then I got shot."]
 34:  453| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  456| [45] ["...!"]
 36:  461| [45] [Now that he thought about it, the enemy did show up with guns last night.]
 37:  466| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  467| [45] [(Crap, it was so obvious. Why didn't I even consider that possibility--!?)]
 39:  472| [45] [Salyu glanced at the painful-looking wound on her arm.]
 40:  480| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  483| [45] ["The enemy has exceptional physical strength and unknown numbers... Our odds don't look good."]
 42:  491| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  494| [45] ["Then what do we do!?"]
 44:  502| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  505| [45] ["All we can do is run. As quickly, and as far away as possible."]
 46:  513| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  516| [45] ["Ghhh....!"]
 48:  521| [45] [Right as Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words, a voice rang out on the intercom.]
 49:  529| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  532| [45] ["According to the roll-call on the ground floor, evacuation of all staff members has been confirmed!"]
 51:  540| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  543| [45] ["In the unlikely event that anyone besides staff members has been left behind, please escape through Areas 5 and 6 immediately!"]
 53:  548| [45] [As she heard the announcement, Salyu sighed in relief.]
 54:  556| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  559| [45] ["That means Dr. Tenkawa managed to escape... so all that's left is for us to evacuate too."]
 56:  567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  570| [45] ["Okay, Salyu, then come down here! Let's escape together!"]
 58:  578| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  581| [45] ["No, I can't climb down with this arm. I think it'd be difficult for you guys to climb up too."]
 60:  589| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  592| [45] ["But if we hesitate, the enemy is likely to catch up to us."]
 62:  600| [47] [Salyu]
 63:  603| [45] ["So let's split up and escape separately."]
 64:  611| [47] [Mashiro]
 65:  614| [45] ["No! Will you be okay by yourself, Salyu!?"]
 66:  622| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  625| [45] ["I will. But there's no time to speak my reasoning."]
 68:  633| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  636| [45] ["So let's use BC."]
 70:  644| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  647| [45] ["!?"]
 72:  652| [45] [Right after Salyu said that--]
 73:  657| [45] [Her mental voice rang out in Natsuhiko's head.]
 74:  665| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  668| [45] ["..."]
 76:  673| [45] [Her clear, high-speed thought process.]
 77:  678| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped as it all came rushing into his head in a single instant.]
 78:  686| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79:  689| [45] ["Salyu...!"]
 80:  694| [45] [Yuuri and Mashiro looked up at Salyu in the same way.]
 81:  702| [47] [Yuuri]
 82:  705| [45] ["Salyu..."]
 83:  713| [47] [Mashiro]
 84:  716| [45] ["Me too, Salyu...!"]
 85:  721| [45] [Natsuhiko forced a smile and spoke up.]
 86:  729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87:  732| [45] ["... Okay! Leave these two to me!"]
 88:  740| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89:  743| [45] ["Promise me one more thing! That we'll all live long enough to meet again on the outside!"]
 90:  751| [47] [Salyu]
 91:  754| [45] ["... Promise."]
 92:  759| [45] [And with that, Salyu disappeared.]
 93:  895| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94:  898| [45] ["... Let's go, you two. We need to keep our promise to Salyu."]
 95:  903| [45] [Mashiro and Yuuri nodded meekly.]
 96:  908| [45] [And then the three of them ran off once more.]
 97:  968| [45] [--The broadcast had said that the staircases in Areas 5 and 6 were safe.]
 98: 1061| [45] [The three of them walked through the connecting passageways towards that goal.]
 99: 1066| [45] [But once they left Area 3 and approached Area 4's outer ring--]
100: 1146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1149| [45] ["!!"]
102: 1154| [45] [They found it wreathed in flames.]
103: 1195| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1198| [45] ["O-oh no...!"]
105: 1224| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1227| [45] ["Hikorin, what do we do...?"]
107: 1232| [45] [Yuuri and Mashiro looked at Natsuhiko with concern.]
108: 1237| [45] [Decisively, Natsuhiko answered.]
109: 1245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1248| [45] ["... Let's cut across."]
111: 1274| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1277| [45] ["Huh!?"]
113: 1285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1288| [45] ["There's no guarantee that the staircases in Areas 5 and 6 will stay safe forever."]
115: 1296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1299| [45] ["So we need to get through Area 4 as quickly as possible."]
117: 1325| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1328| [45] ["T-true... and luckily enough, it doesn't look -that- impassible."]
119: 1336| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1339| [45] ["Yuuri, what about you? Think you can make it?"]
121: 1365| [47] [Yuuri]
122: 1368| [45] ["Yeah, I'm okay."]
123: 1376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1379| [45] ["Okay then, let's go!"]
125: 1384| [45] [And with that, the three of them walked into the fiery area.]
126: 1392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1395| [45] ["Get down low so you don't breathe in the smoke! Cover your mouth with a sleeve!"]
128: 1433| [47] [Yuuri & Mashiro]
129: 1436| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
130: 1467| [45] [The three of them crouched down and walked on the floor.]
131: 1472| [45] [The flames flickered against the walls as the heat waves closed in on them.]
132: 1498| [47] [Mashiro]
133: 1501| [45] ["Ugh!"]
134: 1506| [45] [Eventually, Mashiro rose her voice from behind.]
135: 1511| [45] [Natsuhiko turned around in shock to see her rubbing her eyes painfully.]
136: 1519| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1522| [45] ["What happened!?"]
138: 1548| [47] [Mashiro]
139: 1551| [45] ["Smoke got into my eyes...!"]
140: 1559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1562| [45] ["It's okay. I'll guide you by the hand! You can close your eyes, so just run!"]
142: 1588| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 1591| [45] ["O... okay!"]
144: 1596| [45] [Natsuhiko took her by the hand with his right and Mashiro gripped back firmly.]
145: 1604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 1607| [45] ["You too, Yuuri!"]
147: 1633| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 1636| [45] ["Right!"]
149: 1641| [45] [Natsuhiko grabbed Yuuri by the hand with his left and he ran ahead, guiding the other two--]
150: 1646| [45] [And they somehow managed to slip out of Area 4.]
151: 1791| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1794| [45] ["Haaah!!"]
153: 1799| [45] [The three of them rushed into the connecting passageway to Area 5.]
154: 1977| [45] [The security gate closed behind them automatically, making sure that the flames couldn't follow.]
155: 1985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1988| [45] ["A... are you two okay?"]
157: 2074| [47] [Mashiro]
158: 2077| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
159: 2103| [47] [Yuuri]
160: 2106| [45] ["I'm okay..."]
161: 2111| [45] [Relieved, Natsuhiko led the two girls as they walked through the passageway.]
162: 2216| [45] [But as they turned the corner--]
163: 2295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2298| [45] ["!!"]
165: 2303| [45] [--they found another fire in wait.]
166: 2344| [47] [Mashiro]
167: 2347| [45] ["N-no way...!"]
168: 2355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2358| [45] ["We can't get through...!?"]
170: 2363| [45] [The flames in the passageway were intense. Anyone who would attempt crossing through would surely catch on fire.]
171: 2368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2369| [45] [(Crap, we're caught between the fires...!)]
173: 2374| [45] [When that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Mashiro groaned.]
174: 2452| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 2455| [45] ["... *sniff*... *sniff*..."]
176: 2463| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2466| [45] ["??"]
178: 2474| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2477| [45] ["Mashiro, are you crying!?"]
180: 2530| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2533| [45] ["What's wrong!? Did you get burned somewhere!?"]
182: 2586| [47] [Mashiro]
183: 2589| [45] ["... N-no... I just suddenly... felt like I've wronged everyone...!"]
184: 2594| [45] [Mashiro muttered through her sobs.]
185: 2602| [47] [Mashiro]
186: 2605| [45] ["When I heard about the terrorist plot, I never thought it'd turn out like this..."]
187: 2613| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 2616| [45] ["I got Salyu hurt too... And I got us all caught between the fires..."]
189: 2624| [47] [Mashiro]
190: 2627| [45] ["I should've listened to you, Natsuhiko..."]
191: 2653| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 2656| [45] ["I'm sorry... I'm so sorry I dragged everyone into this...!"]
193: 2661| [45] [--"Dragged"]
194: 2666| [45] [That word shook Natsuhiko's heart.]
195: 2674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2677| [45] ["No, I'm the one who dragged everyone into this...!"]
197: 2703| [47] [Mashiro]
198: 2706| [45] ["Huh...?"]
199: 2714| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2717| [45] ["If I hadn't gone down when the alarm went off, I wouldn't have dragged us all into this."]
201: 2722| [45] [Regret suddenly filled Natsuhiko's heart.]
202: 2727| [45] [He dragged those precious to him into danger once again, just like he did nine years ago.]
203: 2732| [45] [This time not just Yuuri-- but Mashiro and Salyu too.]
204: 2737| [45] [The headache he had forgotten came back stronger, except now it was accompanied by the pangs of guilt.]
205: 2745| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 2748| [45] ["I'm the one at fault, Mashiro. You did nothing wrong."]
207: 2756| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2759| [45] ["So please, don't cry."]
209: 2764| [45] [Mashiro wiped her tears and looked at Natsuhiko.]
210: 2790| [47] [Mashiro]
211: 2793| [45] ["No, Natsuhiko... Don't say that."]
212: 2801| [47] [Mashiro]
213: 2804| [45] ["You're back to your old self now, aren't you?"]
214: 2830| [47] [Mashiro]
215: 2833| [45] ["At the very least... I'm happy for that."]
216: 2838| [45] [Her words were tinged with both gentleness and slight resignation.]
217: 2843| [45] [An intense pain ran through Natsuhiko's chest.]
218: 2848| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 2849| [45] [(Dammit... what do we do...!?)]
220: 2854| [45] [Smoke was drawing near from around the corner, but he couldn't come up with their next move.]
221: 2859| [45] [But that very moment-- Yuuri spoke up.]
222: 2967| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 2970| [45] ["... Mashiron is wrong."]
224: 2978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 2981| [45] ["Huh... Yuuri?"]
226: 3007| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 3010| [45] ["Hikorin, you haven't come back yet. Time has still stopped for you. Just like it has been ever since that fateful day nine years ago."]
228: 3024| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 3027| [45] ["...!"]
230: 3032| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't believe what he saw.]
231: 3037| [45] [That was the same warning Yuuri gave him on September 13.]
232: 3045| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3048| [45] ["It's still stopped...?"]
234: 3074| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 3077| [45] ["Yes. And that's why I... have been rewinding your memory over and over to get your time to move once more."]
236: 3103| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 3106| [45] ["Even if those memories lead to today. Even if those memories hide a bitter truth..."]
238: 3111| [45] [Natsuhiko still couldn't quite understand what Yuuri was saying.]
239: 3116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3117| [45] [(But I do understand what's going to happen now...)]
241: 3122| [45] [That was something that Natsuhiko had already come to digest.]
242: 3127| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 3128| [45] [(Whenever Yuuri says these things, that bizarre phenomenon always occurs, doesn't it...!?)]
244: 3381| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at his watch; it had already begun to tick away the time.]
245: 3386| [45] [The date was 9/14. The time 6:59.]
246: 3391| [45] [Two days before this incident.]
247: 3396| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 3397| [45] [(Ahh... I see.)]
249: 3402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 3403| [45] [(That was the day our daily lives came crashing down.)]
251: 3572| [45] [His vision went dark.]
252: 3577| [45] [And in the darkness, he heard her voice.]
253: 3585| [47] [Yuuri]
254: 3588| [45] ["The true beginning has only just begun. It's time to face the truth."]
255: 3596| [47] [Yuuri]
256: 3599| [45] ["So please, Hikorin. Try not to avert your eyes...!"]
257: 3604| [45] [And as Yuuri appealed to him thusly--]
258: 3609| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness returned to September 14.]
