  0:   44| [55] [âˆšDouble Chapter 6]
  1:   55| [45] [Watase explained the details about the bomb to Natsuhiko and the others.]
  2:   60| [45] [About why they couldn't disarm it, and why the lockdown timer was off.]
  3:   65| [45] [And how at this rate, everyone would die in the explosion--!]
  4:  134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  137| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
  6:  142| [45] [The news shook up Natsuhiko's group. They all began to speak with quivering voices.]
  7:  168| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  171| [45] ["So you're saying we'll all die if we stay here!?"]
  9:  197| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  200| [45] ["Th-then we've gotta think of a way to get out of here!"]
 11:  226| [47] [Ena]
 12:  229| [45] ["D-don't be ridiculous... We searched the place for six hours and found nothing...!"]
 13:  234| [47] [Watase]
 14:  235| [45] ["..."]
 15:  240| [45] [Watase fell silent.]
 16:  245| [47] [Watase]
 17:  246| [45] [(It really is ridiculous...!)]
 18:  251| [45] [They had little time left.]
 19:  256| [45] [Watase realized he couldn't think of anything as he held the amnesiac Kazami in his arms.]
 20:  364| [47] [Watase]
 21:  365| [45] [(... But we've still got to do something...)]
 22:  370| [47] [Watase]
 23:  371| [45] [(The bomb is my responsibility.)]
 24:  376| [47] [Watase]
 25:  377| [45] [(So I have to save everyone here...!)]
 26:  384| [45] [The time was "6:02 PM".]
 27:  389| [45] [Only 15 minutes left until the bomb went off.]
 28:  394| [45] [Watase had come up with an escape plan back in Area Zero, but--]
 29:  399| [47] [Watase]
 30:  400| [45] [(... It's too dangerous to risk bringing up the idea, what with the situation the way it is.)]
 31:  405| [47] [Watase]
 32:  406| [45] [(It would just cause everyone to panic more.)]
 33:  411| [45] [He gave up on that idea.]
 34:  416| [45] [Natsuhiko bitterly spoke to Watase.]
 35:  442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  445| [45] ["Watase... what do you plan to do?"]
 37:  453| [47] [Watase]
 38:  456| [45] ["... At any rate, we'll all die if we stay here."]
 39:  464| [47] [Watase]
 40:  467| [45] ["Let's at least evacuate to a slightly safer place."]
 41:  493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  496| [45] ["A safer place?"]
 43:  501| [45] [Watase nodded.]
 44:  509| [47] [Watase]
 45:  512| [45] ["The bomb's been planted in Area Zero."]
 46:  520| [47] [Watase]
 47:  523| [45] ["I can't predict how the explosion's blast will spread--"]
 48:  531| [47] [Watase]
 49:  534| [45] ["But if we go as far as we can from the blast radius-- in other words, right outside the emergency staircase bulkhead in Area 2-- we should be able to increase our chances of survival just a little."]
 50:  560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  563| [45] ["Then we'll survive if we go there?"]
 52:  571| [47] [Watase]
 53:  574| [45] ["I don't know... but that's the best bet we've got."]
 54:  635| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  638| [45] ["..."]
 56:  643| [45] [He was at a loss for any better options.]
 57:  648| [45] [Impatience and confusion had taken their toll on Watase's sense of judgment.]
 58:  653| [45] [Everyone looked uneasy, but they reluctantly nodded.]
 59:  661| [47] [Watase]
 60:  664| [45] ["... The faster we get there, the better. Let's go."]
 61:  690| [47] [Jun]
 62:  693| [45] ["Yeah... c'mon, Sis."]
 63:  719| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  722| [45] ["Ah... o-okay..."]
 65:  735| [45] [Jun took Kazami's hand and walked off.]
 66:  740| [45] [Everyone else followed suit.]
 67:  847| [45] [--The nine of them then reached the bulkhead.]
 68:  852| [45] [The time was "6:08 PM".]
 69:  857| [45] [Only nine minutes left until the explosion.]
 70:  862| [45] [Watase and the others endured their fear and waited for that moment.]
 71:  867| [45] [The mind-crushing silence was eventually shattered when Kazami broke the ice.]
 72:  893| [47] [Kazami]
 73:  896| [45] ["U-um..."]
 74:  904| [47] [Watase]
 75:  907| [45] ["... What is it?"]
 76:  933| [47] [Kazami]
 77:  936| [45] ["The two of you... look somewhat familiar to me..."]
 78:  941| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase and Jun, then continued.]
 79:  967| [47] [Kazami]
 80:  970| [45] ["... Who were you guys to me...?"]
 81:  975| [45] [Jun answered that question.]
 82: 1002| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1005| [45] ["I'm your... sister."]
 84: 1037| [47] [Kazami]
 85: 1040| [45] ["Sister...?"]
 86: 1066| [47] [Kazami]
 87: 1069| [45] ["Then what about you...?"]
 88: 1074| [45] [Watase looked away from Kazami after he was asked that.]
 89: 1082| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1085| [45] ["... I'm the one who's responsible for putting you..."]
 91: 1093| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1096| [45] ["No... for putting -everyone- through this nightmare."]
 93: 1122| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1125| [45] ["This nightmare?"]
 95: 1133| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1136| [45] ["Yeah..."]
 97: 1144| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1147| [45] ["I was trying to destroy this facility to satisfy my own personal grudge."]
 99: 1155| [47] [Watase]
100: 1158| [45] ["As a result, the bomb I planted is about to explode very soon."]
101: 1166| [47] [Watase]
102: 1169| [45] ["But I failed to take something into account... and now you and everyone else will suffer for it."]
103: 1195| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1198| [45] ["No way...!"]
105: 1203| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase and rose her voice in astonishment.]
106: 1229| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1232| [45] ["You're not the kind of person who'd do something like that, right?"]
108: 1240| [47] [Watase]
109: 1243| [45] ["You wouldn't know that, would you? Seeing as how you've lost your memories and all."]
110: 1295| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1298| [45] ["No, I can tell."]
112: 1324| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1327| [45] ["It's true that I've forgotten everything... but while I can't quite explain it..."]
114: 1353| [47] [Kazami]
115: 1356| [45] ["I can remember that much for some reason."]
116: 1364| [47] [Kazami]
117: 1367| [45] ["I know you're a very kind person with a strong sense of justice..."]
118: 1372| [47] [Watase]
119: 1373| [45] ["..."]
120: 1406| [45] [Watase couldn't say anything.]
121: 1411| [45] [Nor could anyone else.]
122: 1416| [47] [Watase]
123: 1417| [45] [(Kind? A strong sense of justice? Me...?)]
124: 1422| [47] [Watase]
125: 1423| [45] [(That "sense of justice" is what dragged all of you into this mess...!)]
126: 1428| [45] [Watase was full of regret.]
127: 1483| [45] [For learning the truth behind Wataru's death--]
128: 1535| [45] [And for everything he'd done today right up to this very instant.]
129: 1550| [47] [Watase]
130: 1551| [45] [(Was there no other way...!?)]
131: 1556| [47] [Watase]
132: 1557| [45] [(There must've been a correct route to take that would've kept everyone from falling into this miserable--)]
133: 1562| [45] [A flash of insight suddenly rushed through Watase's head at that moment.]
134: 1567| [47] [Watase]
135: 1568| [45] [(That's right... at the very least--)]
136: 1573| [47] [Watase]
137: 1574| [45] [(I can make it harder for the explosion to make it all the way over here!)]
138: 1579| [45] [That was the lone ray of hope that'd shone through this despair.]
139: 1584| [45] [When it came down to it, explosions basically spread in the paths of least resistance.]
140: 1589| [45] [Then in that case, since everyone was in Area 2--]
141: 1594| [45] [If he could reroute the explosion towards Area 5, the complete opposite side of the facility,%Nit could at least slightly improve their chances of survival.]
142: 1599| [45] [That said, it was a plan with slim chances for success.]
143: 1604| [45] [But they had to gamble on it.]
144: 1609| [45] [Watase then spoke up.]
145: 1635| [47] [Watase]
146: 1638| [45] ["Moribe, sorry... there's something I have to take care of."]
147: 1664| [47] [Jun]
148: 1667| [45] ["Huh?"]
149: 1675| [47] [Watase]
150: 1678| [45] ["Take care of Kazami and the others."]
151: 1686| [47] [Watase]
152: 1689| [45] ["Don't follow me, guys. I mean it."]
153: 1715| [47] [Jun]
154: 1718| [45] ["H-hold on Captain, what are you--!?"]
155: 1744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1747| [45] ["What the hell are you trying to do, Watase!?"]
157: 1752| [45] [Watase ignored everyone's shouts--]
158: 1811| [45] [And descended the emergency staircase.]
159: 1876| [45] [He then ran over to Area N as fast as he could.]
160: 1881| [45] [He glared at the six security gates surrounding him.]
161: 1892| [47] [Watase]
162: 1893| [45] [(The explosion will spread into every direction leading out of Area N once it rises from Area Zero!)]
163: 1898| [47] [Watase]
164: 1899| [45] [(Then all I have to do is just open the gate from Area N to Area 5 and keep the rest shut!)]
165: 1915| [45] [Watase headed towards Area 5 and stood in front of its gate.]
166: 1922| [45] [According to his watch, it was "6:15 PM".]
167: 1927| [45] [Only two minutes to go before the explosion.]
168: 1932| [45] [All he had to do was open the gate just as the explosion occurred.]
169: 1937| [45] [That said, Watase would die for sure if he went through with it.]
170: 1942| [45] [No one could survive being directly above the explosion's blast radius.]
171: 1947| [47] [Watase]
172: 1948| [45] [(Hmph... so what?)]
173: 1953| [45] [Watase broke out into a self-deprecating laugh.]
174: 1958| [45] [He suddenly remembered what had happened just a few hours ago.]
175: 1963| [45] [Back when he still hadn't regained his memories.]
176: 2017| [45] [He went into Area N all by himself to save everyone back then, too.]
177: 2022| [45] [He had thought his own life meant nothing if it meant saving the others.]
178: 2027| [45] [That sadly pure conviction felt so radiant to Watase now.]
179: 2042| [47] [Watase]
180: 2043| [45] [(... I've just gone back to the way I was back then.)]
181: 2048| [47] [Watase]
182: 2049| [45] [(Now I can finally fulfill my plans from back--)]
183: 2054| [45] [But at that moment,]
184: 2059| [45] [he suddenly heard a voice behind him.]
185: 2069| [47] [???]
186: 2072| [45] ["Um..."]
187: 2095| [47] [Watase]
188: 2098| [45] ["!!"]
189: 2135| [45] [Watase turned around to find Kazami standing there.]
190: 2140| [45] [His eyes widened, and he started shouting.]
191: 2148| [47] [Watase]
192: 2151| [45] ["You... you dumbass! Why did you follow me!?"]
193: 2178| [47] [Kazami]
194: 2181| [45] ["I don't really know why... but I chased after you because I was worried about you."]
195: 2189| [47] [Watase]
196: 2192| [45] ["Your presence here only makes things worse!"]
197: 2200| [47] [Watase]
198: 2203| [45] ["Didn't Moribe try to stop you!?"]
199: 2229| [47] [Kazami]
200: 2232| [45] ["I shook her off. Should I not have done that...?"]
201: 2255| [47] [Watase]
202: 2258| [45] ["..."]
203: 2263| [45] [Watase gasped and checked his watch once again.]
204: 2270| [45] [Only 23 seconds to go until the explosion.]
205: 2275| [45] [She'd never make it back to the others if she were to try to run back now--]
206: 2283| [47] [Watase]
207: 2286| [45] ["Go back, Kazami! You have to live!"]
208: 2340| [47] [Kazami]
209: 2343| [45] ["I refuse."]
210: 2351| [47] [Watase]
211: 2354| [45] ["Just shut up and go back! You'll die with me if you don't!"]
212: 2380| [47] [Kazami]
213: 2383| [45] ["... I'm fine with that."]
214: 2388| [45] [Kazami sounded like she was pleading with Watase.]
215: 2414| [47] [Kazami]
216: 2417| [45] ["When I woke up, words like 'live' and 'die' suddenly didn't feel real anymore."]
217: 2443| [47] [Kazami]
218: 2446| [45] ["But for some reason... nothing feels real to me except what my heart's telling me now."]
219: 2472| [47] [Kazami]
220: 2475| [45] ["It's telling me that if I'm going to die, then I want to die with you."]
221: 2498| [47] [Watase]
222: 2501| [45] ["--"]
223: 2506| [45] [Watase's face warped with grief.]
224: 2511| [45] [There wasn't any time left.]
225: 2522| [45] [Watase reluctantly opened the gate to Area 5--]
226: 2567| [45] [And heard a thunderous roar rise up from below at that moment.]
227: 2575| [47] [Watase]
228: 2578| [45] ["--It's here!!"]
229: 2634| [47] [Kazami]
230: 2637| [45] ["!!"]
231: 2642| [45] [Kazami's body trembled with a start.]
232: 2649| [45] [Watase gripped her arms and held her close to him.]
233: 2821| [45] [--He could feel a massive surge of heat ascending from Area Zero.]
234: 2826| [45] [Death was creeping towards them from the very depths of the Earth.]
235: 2831| [45] [It would only take a mere moment for it to completely fill Area N.]
236: 2836| [45] [In that second that lasted longer than an eternity--]
237: 2841| [45] [Watase embraced Kazami.]
238: 3095| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%Nã€€%N]
239: 3098| [45] [âˆšD Bad Ending #5 [The Vanquished Loyalist]]
240: 3101| [85] [ã€€]
241: 3104| [45] [The result of erasing Kazami's memories.]
242: 3107| [85] [ã€€]
243: 3110| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting your Senses to take both Watase and Kazami's safety into account at the SSS input right before this ending.]
