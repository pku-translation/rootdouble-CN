  1:   87| [45] [--30 minutes after entering the store...]
  2:  174| [47] [Mashiro]
  3:  177| [45] ["Hey, hey, what do you think about this one?"]
  4:  248| [47] [Salyu]
  5:  251| [45] ["I-I don't know."]
  6:  322| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  325| [45] ["Kyah! This one's cute too!"]
  8:  571| [45] [Mashiro treated Salyu almost like a dress-up doll.]
  9:  576| [45] [Mashiro was excited. Salyu was confused.]
 10:  581| [45] [And from a short distance away, Natsuhiko watched.]
 11:  590| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  593| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Look at this! Isn't Salyu super cute?"]
 13:  601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  604| [45] ["Mmm..."]
 15:  792| [45] [She certainly was cute, which went without saying.]
 16:  797| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't help but be captivated by Salyu's change in appearance.]
 17:  802| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  803| [45] [(I don't know what she's thinking, and to be honest, she's a little eerie. But, well, she does have a beautiful face...)]
 19:  808| [45] [Dressed in those tasteful clothes, she was truly like a doll.]
 20:  853| [45] [But Salyu herself muttered in extreme discomfort.]
 21:  864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  867| [45] ["... Well, it's so-so, I guess."]
 23:  904| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  907| [45] ["Oh, and since when were you a fashion critic?"]
 25:  912| [45] [Mashiro was a little annoyed at Natsuhiko's noncommittal response.]
 26:  917| [45] [But Salyu herself muttered in extreme discomfort.]
 27:  925| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  928| [45] ["... Um, Mashiro."]
 29:  965| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  968| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 31:  976| [47] [Salyu]
 32:  979| [45] ["This is the tenth outfit. Which one should we go with?"]
 33: 1018| [47] [Mashiro]
 34: 1021| [45] ["I really don't know... I wanna buy them all, but..."]
 35: 1029| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36: 1032| [45] ["C'mon, Mashiro, you know that's not gonna happen."]
 37: 1115| [47] [Mashiro]
 38: 1118| [45] ["True, true. So what about you, Salyu? Which do you like best?"]
 39: 1126| [47] [Salyu]
 40: 1129| [45] ["... I can't decide."]
 41: 1137| [47] [Mashiro]
 42: 1140| [45] ["Then what about you, Natsuhiko?"]
 43: 1148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44: 1151| [45] ["Huh? Uh... let's see..."]
 45: 1156| [45] [Natsuhiko was unfamiliar with fashion, but he still tried to think before answering.]
 46: 1173| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47: 1176| [45] ["Hmm, I guess that outfit's the best, isn't it?"]
 48: 1213| [47] [Mashiro]
 49: 1216| [45] ["You think so too?"]
 50: 1224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51: 1227| [45] ["Yeah, you've got good taste, Mashiro."]
 52: 1232| [45] [It was a clothing coordination with a youthful image that really seemed to match Salyu's short build.]
 53: 1237| [45] [The clothes really suited Salyu's age and matched her aura to a T.]
 54: 1245| [47] [Mashiro]
 55: 1248| [45] ["Okay, then let's go with that outfit!"]
 56: 1260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1263| [45] ["... Salyu looks best in that, I guess."]
 58: 1271| [47] [Salyu]
 59: 1274| [45] ["Huh... you think so?"]
 60: 1282| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1285| [45] ["Yeah. Well, sure, I get the feeling she'd look good in anything she'd wear, though..."]
 62: 1293| [47] [Mashiro]
 63: 1296| [45] ["Well, that is true~"]
 64: 1304| [47] [Salyu]
 65: 1307| [45] ["I'm not sure about that..."]
 66: 1312| [45] [After a moment of thinking, Salyu answered with a sigh.]
 67: 1320| [47] [Salyu]
 68: 1323| [45] ["Okay, then let's go with this one."]
 69: 1334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1337| [45] ["Well, it's not really like I've got a discerning eye for girl's clothing..."]
 71: 1345| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1348| [45] ["Don't you think it'd be better for you two to choose amongst yourselves?"]
 73: 1356| [47] [Mashiro]
 74: 1359| [45] ["Uugh~ you're such a downer..."]
 75: 1367| [47] [Salyu]
 76: 1370| [45] ["Mashiro, I'm fine with these."]
 77: 1378| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1381| [45] ["The size fits and above all, it's easy to move in."]
 79: 1389| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1392| [45] ["Really? Then let's go with that, shall we?"]
 81: 1397| [45] [Mashiro seemed extremely happy, but Salyu sighed as she spoke.]
 82: 1405| [47] [Salyu]
 83: 1408| [45] ["... I'm tired."]
 84: 1445| [47] [Mashiro]
 85: 1448| [45] ["But all things considered, you do seem pretty happy, you know?"]
 86: 1519| [47] [Salyu]
 87: 1522| [45] ["Th-that's not true."]
 88: 1530| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1533| [45] ["You sure~? You're blushing."]
 90: 1538| [47] [Salyu]
 91: 1539| [45] ["..."]
 92: 1544| [45] [Salyu said nothing, but--]
 93: 1714| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1715| [45] [(... Ah.)]
 95: 1720| [45] [That's when Natsuhiko saw something most curious:]
 96: 1725| [45] [A smile upon Salyu's supple lips.]
 97: 1730| [45] [With a smile on her face and cute clothes wrapped around her body, she looked like the epitome of a pure, innocent girl.]
 98: 1735| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1736| [45] [(What's with that? Never expected that reaction...)]
100: 1741| [45] [In any case, it appeared that Mashiro's efforts were worth it after all.]
101: 1746| [45] [Lost in thought, Natsuhiko found a faint smile forming on his own lips.]
102: 1832| [45] [--And after taking care of the bill, he left the store with the two girls.]
