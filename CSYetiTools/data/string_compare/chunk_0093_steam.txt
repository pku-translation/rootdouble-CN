  0:  138| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 6]
  1:  145| [47] [Watase]
  2:  148| [45] ["Whoa!"]
  3:  153| [45] [Watase strafed to the side to dodge the sudden swing.]
  4:  158| [45] [He desperately put distance between him and his attacker, then confirmed their identity.]
  5:  163| [45] [Standing there was none other than--]
  6:  216| [47] [Watase]
  7:  219| [45] ["You're--!?"]
  8:  224| [45] [It was "Salyu", the girl who'd run away from him twice now.]
  9:  229| [45] [A light as cold as ice shimmered in the depths of her eyes.]
 10:  234| [45] [Gripped in her hand was a burnt axe.]
 11:  242| [47] [Watase]
 12:  245| [45] ["That axe... it's...!"]
 13:  322| [45] [--It was the one that had been clutched in the hand of his deceased coworker, "Hiyama".]
 14:  368| [45] [The one that had mysteriously disappeared later on.]
 15:  373| [45] [Watase had been wondering this whole time who had taken it, and now--!]
 16:  379| [45] [But they'd left it behind in Area 4. So why did Salyu have it--!?]
 17:  582| [47] [Watase]
 18:  585| [45] ["No way, did you take it...!?"]
 19:  590| [45] [Salyu ignored Watase's question,]
 20:  656| [45] [and charged straight at him again.]
 21:  723| [47] [Watase]
 22:  726| [45] ["Whoa!"]
 23:  731| [45] [She was aiming for Watase's neck.]
 24:  736| [45] [He barely leaned back in time, leaving the axe to slice only through air.]
 25:  741| [45] [The weight of the weapon was throwing her around, causing her to sway forward heavily.]
 26:  798| [47] [Watase]
 27:  799| [45] [(Now!)]
 28:  804| [45] [He immediately grabbed for Salyu.]
 29:  809| [45] [But she swung her leg up a second earlier.]
 30:  935| [47] [Watase]
 31:  938| [45] ["Gah!?"]
 32:  943| [45] [She made use of her centrifugal force to launch a swift kick, connecting solidly with his temple.]
 33:  948| [45] [Watase's brain rattled and his vision grew dark.]
 34:  953| [45] [Despite that, he still managed to quickly thrust Salyu away.]
 35: 1108| [45] [He then jumped back and put some distance between them again.]
 36: 1157| [45] [He was greeted with a cold look on Salyu's face when his sight came back.]
 37: 1162| [47] [Watase]
 38: 1163| [45] [(Wh... what's she doing...!?)]
 39: 1168| [45] [She attacked without the slightest hesitation using battle techniques that didn't befit a girl of her size and age--]
 40: 1176| [47] [Watase]
 41: 1179| [45] ["Khh...!"]
 42: 1184| [45] [Worse, Watase's headaches and convulsions were only getting stronger.]
 43: 1189| [45] [It was likely he'd die for real if he fought in this condition.]
 44: 1196| [45] [And fighting with the pistol, his first natural choice, was simply not an option here.]
 45: 1201| [47] [Watase]
 46: 1202| [45] [(Dammit... I've got to find a way to subdue her without getting her hurt...!)]
 47: 1208| [45] [Watase hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should take out the pistol in his breast pocket.]
 48: 1213| [47] [Watase]
 49: 1214| [45] [(... No, what am I thinking!? I can't hurt someone else to protect myself!)]
 50: 1219| [45] [Just as he thought that-- he noticed that Salyu's body was faintly trembling.]
 51: 1224| [45] [She was convulsing the same way Watase had been for a while now.]
 52: 1232| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1235| [45] ["H-hey! You wouldn't happen to have a headache too, would you!?"]
 54: 1243| [47] [Salyu]
 55: 1246| [45] ["..."]
 56: 1254| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1257| [45] ["Then get out of here right now!"]
 58: 1265| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1268| [45] ["What good is fighting me if it means putting your body in such extreme danger!?"]
 60: 1273| [45] [Salyu suddenly stopped in what appeared to be surprise.]
 61: 1281| [47] [Salyu]
 62: 1284| [45] ["... That line again."]
 63: 1292| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1295| [45] ["'Again'?"]
 65: 1303| [47] [Salyu]
 66: 1306| [45] ["You said the same thing last time as well."]
 67: 1314| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1317| [45] ["Wh... what!?"]
 69: 1322| [45] [Watase's body froze with surprise and confusion.]
 70: 1327| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1328| [45] [(When was this "last" time!? When did this girl and I--!?)]
 72: 1333| [45] [That moment of confusion left Watase wide open.]
 73: 1389| [45] [Salyu charged at him yet again.]
 74: 1394| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1395| [45] [(Shit!)]
 76: 1400| [45] [I can't hold out next time! I'll be done for!]
 77: 1405| [45] [When Watase thought that-- his body moved on its own.]
 78: 1596| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1597| [45] [(!)]
 80: 1602| [45] [Watase then lowered his body as if he was putting himself into a crouch start for a 100 meter dash.]
 81: 1607| [45] [He filled his legs with strength, then released it all at once and sprung at Salyu.]
 82: 1695| [47] [Salyu]
 83: 1698| [45] ["!?"]
 84: 1703| [45] [Her face was filled with shock.]
 85: 1708| [45] [Watase tackled her with the force of a bullet a second later, hitting her right in the waist.]
 86: 1829| [47] [Salyu]
 87: 1832| [45] ["*cough*!"]
 88: 1837| [45] [The axe slipped out of Salyu's hand as she fell on her back.]
 89: 1842| [45] [Watase used his remaining momentum to straddle her.]
