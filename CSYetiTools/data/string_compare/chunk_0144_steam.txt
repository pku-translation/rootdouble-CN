  1:   18| [45] [--After lunch break--]
  2:   29| [45] [An extracurricular lesson was scheduled for the afternoon classes.]
  3:   34| [45] [The students were to board a bus for a field trip to an outside facility.]
  4:  108| [45] [Natsuhiko and the others left the school with Ena.]
  5:  207| [45] [And as they waited at the bus stop in front of the school gate, Mashiro talked to Salyu again.]
  6:  215| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  218| [45] ["Salyu, how was the cafeteria food?"]
  8:  244| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  247| [45] ["Normal."]
 10:  252| [45] [They were apparently talking about the food they ate just a while ago.]
 11:  257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  258| [45] [("Normal", huh... Just how long is she going to keep up the lone wolf act?)]
 13:  284| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  287| [45] ["I was just a little surprised."]
 15:  313| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  316| [45] ["Huh, about what?"]
 17:  342| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  345| [45] ["The system for buying your own food."]
 19:  353| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  356| [45] ["I thought all food was supposed to be served to you."]
 21:  364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  367| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 23:  372| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't help but interject at her odd statement.]
 24:  380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  383| [45] ["Food's supposed to be served to you...? Is that how it is at rich girl schools?"]
 26:  409| [47] [Salyu]
 27:  412| [45] ["I don't know what you mean by 'rich girl schools', but I personally have never gone and bought my own food before."]
 28:  420| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  423| [45] ["R-really...?"]
 30:  428| [45] [Natsuhiko was taken a little by surprise, but Mashiro, on the other hand, spoke calmly.]
 31:  454| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  457| [45] ["Haah, I guess French schools really are such high society establishments."]
 33:  483| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  486| [45] ["Well, if you come across anything else you don't quite understand, don't hesitate to ask."]
 35:  512| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  515| [45] ["Anything I don't understand..."]
 37:  520| [45] [Salyu pondered Mashiro's offer for a little bit, and then--]
 38:  546| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  549| [45] ["... What's that?"]
 40:  587| [45] [She pointed outside the school gate and inquired.]
 41:  799| [45] [Salyu's finger was aimed at a camera overlooking the street in plain sight.]
 42:  807| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  810| [45] ["Oh, that's a security camera."]
 44:  818| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  821| [45] ["Security camera...? For keeping the students under surveillance?"]
 46:  829| [47] [Mashiro]
 47:  832| [45] ["Ahah, no, not quite. It's just to make sure nobody suspicious tries to get into the school."]
 48:  917| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  920| [45] ["That reminds me, I saw a lot of those around town yesterday, too. Are they everywhere?"]
 50:  946| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  949| [45] ["Yup. There are security cameras all over Rokumei City to keep a careful eye on any suspicious people."]
 52:  954| [45] [Mashiro explained pridefully.]
 53:  959| [45] [The security cameras established high levels of public order within the city.]
 54:  985| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  988| [45] ["What an odd city. Something feels a little off."]
 56: 1015| [47] [Mashiro]
 57: 1018| [45] ["True, I guess it does have its peculiarities.%NIt is a 'government designated top secret city' after all."]
 58: 1044| [47] [Salyu]
 59: 1047| [45] ["... What's that?"]
 60: 1073| [47] [Mashiro]
 61: 1076| [45] ["Hmm... I think it's probably a Japan-only thing..."]
 62: 1102| [47] [Mashiro]
 63: 1105| [45] ["I know, Natsuhiko, you're into social studies, right? You explain it."]
 64: 1113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1116| [45] ["Huh, me?"]
 66: 1139| [45] [It seemed like Mashiro wanted to make Natsuhiko and Salyu talk.]
 67: 1144| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed and started explaining.]
 68: 1152| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1155| [45] ["... So basically, this city is designated by the government as a special zone for science,%Nso heavy regulations are imposed to prioritize safety first."]
 70: 1181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1184| [45] ["And to enforce those regulations, we have various systems and devices installed around the streets. Including those security cameras."]
 72: 1192| [47] [Salyu]
 73: 1195| [45] ["What other sorts of systems are in place?"]
 74: 1203| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1206| [45] ["Let's see... there's a complex process you need to go through to move, I guess..."]
 76: 1214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1217| [45] ["And just to leave the city, you need to notify city hall beforehand."]
 78: 1243| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1246| [45] ["... Why so thorough?"]
 80: 1254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1257| [45] ["There are a lot of research facilities in the city, so there are warranted concerns of industrial espionage. I bet they expect nothing less than perfect security."]
 82: 1265| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1268| [45] ["Many of the facilities carry on important research involving national policy, so they need to be careful of any information leaks."]
 84: 1294| [47] [Mashiro]
 85: 1297| [45] ["Exactly. There are even rumors that phone calls and emails are filtered to detect leaks, too."]
 86: 1323| [47] [Mashiro]
 87: 1326| [45] ["So what do you think, Salyu? Doesn't it sound like the whole city is a top secret laboratory? It's so cool and sci-fi-like, don't 'cha think?"]
 88: 1352| [47] [Salyu]
 89: 1355| [45] ["..."]
 90: 1360| [45] [Salyu stared in wonder at Mashiro's pressing question.]
 91: 1368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1371| [45] ["There you go again with your delusional babbling, Mashiro. When you've lived here from birth,%Nit all becomes a normal sight, doesn't it?"]
 93: 1379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1382| [45] ["The security cameras are essentially just window stickers that say 'police on duty'.%NThe innocent should have nothing to fear."]
 95: 1408| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1411| [45] ["But the security seems a little excessive to me."]
 97: 1437| [47] [Mashiro]
 98: 1440| [45] ["Not at all. The heightened security actually gives us peace of mind."]
 99: 1466| [47] [Mashiro]
100: 1469| [45] ["After all, we've got -that- thing in our city."]
101: 1492| [45] [Mashiro pointed to the bus stop's provided map as she spoke.]
102: 1662| [45] [And drawn on the edge of that map-- the outskirts of town-- was a huge hexagonal building.]
103: 1670| [47] [Salyu]
104: 1673| [45] ["What's that...?"]
105: 1682| [47] [Mashiro]
106: 1685| [45] ["That's 'LABO'. Rokumei City's largest research facility--"]
107: 1693| [47] [Mashiro]
108: 1696| [45] ["It's Japan's model atomic energy research institute."]
109: 1702| [45] [Natsuhiko stiffened at the sound of those words.]
110: 1707| [45] [Because that was the very same singular thing that bothered him about the city.]
111: 1831| [45] [LABO-- its proper name being]
112: 1834| [45] ["The 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization"]
113: 1838| [45] [An independent administrative corporation that developed technology and conducted research on atomic energy and its biological effects. ]
114: 1843| [45] [It was a national facility, but its management was entrusted to Rokumei City.]
115: 1847| [45] [One thing was special about this facility--%Nthere was a "small-scale nuclear reactor" housed within the premises for research purposes.]
116: 1852| [45] [They used it to perform several tasks from nuclear fission experiments to nuclear fusion reactor development:%Nan enormously profitable field of research.]
117: 1857| [45] [And for the risks the research brought, the national government provided subsidies to the city.]
118: 1861| [45] [As a result, the formerly ordinary Rokumei City was reborn as the city of scientific research it was today.]
119: 1866| [45] [In terms of economics, industry, and science altogether, LABO could very well be said to be the town's core.]
120: 1953| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1956| [45] ["If there were any industrial spies, that would be their first target. They say they've got world-class industry leaders in both researchers and equipment."]
122: 1982| [47] [Mashiro]
123: 1985| [45] ["And Natsuhiko's mother is the face of those industry-leading researchers, isn't she~?"]
124: 1990| [45] [Mashiro smiled as she brought up the subject.]
125: 1998| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 2001| [45] ["... I guess."]
127: 2006| [45] [But Natsuhiko looked slightly ashamed about it.]
128: 2154| [45] [Natsuhiko's mother, Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa, was a researcher at LABO.]
129: 2159| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't quite know everything about her credentials, but he knew that she was an apparently world-leading physicist.]
130: 2163| [45] [However, Natsuhiko wasn't very fond of his cool-headed researcher of a mother.]
131: 2278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2279| [45] [(True, I guess the research results Mom's team produces do provide the city with huge profits.)]
133: 2284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2285| [45] [(And both the town's prosperity and our livelihoods benefit from it, but still...)]
135: 2290| [45] [True enough, Natsuhiko's mother had quite a high salary.]
136: 2341| [45] [But despite that fact, Natsuhiko really did not like the facility of LABO itself that much.]
137: 2346| [45] [And it wasn't just because he didn't get along with his mother.]
138: 2351| [45] [The real reason had to do with Natsuhiko's personal past.]
139: 2428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 2429| [45] [(... If only I didn't go to LABO that day...)]
141: 2434| [45] [Bitter regret spread through his heart.]
142: 2546| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 2549| [45] ["... What's wrong, Natsuhiko? Why the sudden silence?"]
144: 2563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2566| [45] ["Huh? Uh, uhh..."]
146: 2574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2577| [45] ["It's nothing. Anyway, when's that bus gonna get here?"]
148: 2643| [45] [The moment he said that, the bus came rolling in.]
149: 2669| [47] [Ena]
150: 2672| [45] ["Okay, everybody. There are no assigned seats, so arrange yourselves however you'd like, okay?"]
151: 2739| [47] [Mashiro]
152: 2742| [45] ["In that case, let's sit close together, you two."]
153: 2750| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2753| [45] ["Ah, sure. I get the feeling the other boys are glaring at me, though."]
155: 2776| [47] [Salyu]
156: 2777| [45] ["..."]
157: 2782| [45] [Salyu looked like she wanted to say something--]
158: 2805| [45] [But eventually, she just nodded at Mashiro's words and boarded the bus.]
