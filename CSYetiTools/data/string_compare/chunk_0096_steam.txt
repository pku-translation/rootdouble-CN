  1:  103| [47] [Watase]
  2:  106| [45] ["!?"]
  3:  111| [45] [Watase and Kazami turned around in shock to find Ukita standing there.]
  4:  137| [47] [Ukita]
  5:  140| [45] ["Well well, if it isn't Captain Kasasagi and Lieutenant Tachibana."]
  6:  166| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  169| [45] ["I thought I heard noises coming from here. What might you two be up to?"]
  8:  174| [47] [Watase]
  9:  175| [45] [(Wh-what...?)]
 10:  180| [45] [Ukita's eyes were glazed over with instability.]
 11:  185| [45] [His gaze locked onto the two survivors resting in their respective beds.]
 12:  211| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  214| [45] ["Natsuhiko!? And Louise!?"]
 14:  222| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  225| [45] ["Dear Lord... How'd they get hurt so badly!? And where have they been this whole time...!?"]
 16:  230| [45] [Watase carefully chose his words as he answered.]
 17:  238| [47] [Watase]
 18:  241| [45] ["You see... I took the two of them into custody in Area N after I went there to try and put the fires out."]
 19:  267| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  270| [45] ["Did you just say... putting out the fires in Area N?"]
 21:  296| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  299| [45] ["I see... now I finally understand...!"]
 23:  307| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  310| [45] ["I knew it! You really are a traitor, through and through!"]
 25:  318| [47] [Watase]
 26:  321| [45] ["O-old man...?"]
 27:  326| [45] [He didn't understand why Ukita was angry.]
 28:  331| [45] [But Ukita ignored the bewilderment on Watase's face and continued talking in a subdued voice.]
 29:  357| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  360| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... I know you'll have trouble believing this, but I did trust you."]
 31:  368| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  371| [45] ["I truly believed you to be a man of justice..."]
 33:  397| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  400| [45] ["That's why I risked my life in my own way to save those girls. But then you...!"]
 35:  426| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  429| [45] ["You'll pay for this...!"]
 37:  434| [45] [Ukita grunted and reached into his breast pocket.]
 38:  439| [45] [He then pulled out-- a pistol.]
 39:  622| [47] [Watase]
 40:  625| [45] ["!?"]
 41:  630| [45] [It was the same pistol that Ena had given him.]
 42:  635| [45] [The one whose bullets and magazine had been removed and given to Jun and Ena for safekeeping, leaving Ukita with the gun itself. It should have been unloaded--]
 43:  643| [47] [Watase]
 44:  646| [45] ["Is this your idea of a bluff!? That thing's no better than a toy without a magazine, you know!?"]
 45:  654| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  657| [45] ["A bluff? Oh, so I guess you didn't know, did you?"]
 47:  665| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  668| [45] ["You can still fire a gun without a magazine so long as you have bullets.%NGranted, you do have to load and fire them one at a time."]
 49:  676| [47] [Watase]
 50:  679| [45] ["Where in the hell did you get bullets...!?"]
 51:  687| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  690| [45] ["Where indeed."]
 53:  695| [45] [Ukita's attitude made it clear that he apparently wasn't bluffing.]
 54:  703| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  706| [45] ["... Go ahead and laugh. I know it's fragile justice. But it's my choice."]
 56:  714| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  717| [45] ["If killing you means it'll put an end to all of this, then I'll do what I must."]
 58:  725| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  728| [45] ["Even if it means staining my hands in sin for the first and last time in my life...!"]
 60:  733| [45] [--Ukita's words made no sense. His face was clearly brimming with insanity.]
 61:  741| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  744| [45] ["M-Mr. Ukita...!"]
 63:  752| [47] [Watase]
 64:  755| [45] ["Wait, listen to me before you fire that thing!"]
 65:  763| [47] [Watase]
 66:  766| [45] ["Maybe you didn't know this, but there is no nuclear reactor in Area N!"]
 67:  774| [47] [Watase]
 68:  777| [45] ["So there was no need for us to be afraid of any radiation from the very beginning!"]
 69:  782| [45] [If it was Ukita's fear of radiation that had caused him to fall so far off the beaten track, then hearing that would likely bring him back to his senses.]
 70:  787| [45] [However--]
 71:  834| [47] [Ukita]
 72:  837| [45] ["You..."]
 73:  845| [47] [Ukita]
 74:  848| [45] ["You're still uttering such nonsense at this point...?"]
 75:  856| [47] [Watase]
 76:  859| [45] ["Believe me! It's the truth!"]
 77:  867| [47] [Ukita]
 78:  870| [45] ["Well, it matters not. Either way--"]
 79:  917| [47] [Ukita]
 80:  920| [45] ["--Your 'mission' ends here!"]
 81:  928| [47] [Watase]
 82:  931| [45] ["!?"]
 83:  939| [47] [Ukita]
 84:  942| [45] ["Die, traitor!"]
 85:  947| [45] [Ukita pulled the trigger. Watase froze in terror.]
 86:  952| [45] [--But right then...]
 87: 1032| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1035| [45] ["Captain! Look out!"]
 89: 1152| [45] [Ukita's bullet bore a hole in the wall behind Watase.]
 90: 1238| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1241| [45] ["Old man!"]
 92: 1246| [45] [Watase pulled his pistol out as Kazami grappled with Ukita.]
 93: 1272| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1275| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
 95: 1329| [45] [Ukita frantically turned around when he caught sight of the gun pointed straight at him.]
 96: 1334| [45] [Watase had a chance to shoot him in the back right there-- but he couldn't pull the trigger.]
 97: 1339| [45] [He didn't even know if there were any bullets left in that pistol.]
 98: 1344| [45] [Ukita ran right out of the door and out of sight.]
 99: 1349| [45] [The only trace of him left was his shouts coming from the hallway.]
100: 1475| [47] [Ukita]
101: 1478| [45] ["So you've shown your true colors at last, Captain Kasasagi!"]
102: 1486| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1489| [45] ["But I -will- ensure that you get your just deserts! Mark my words!"]
104: 1530| [45] [The sound of Ukita's footsteps disappeared in the direction of Area 4.]
105: 1576| [47] [Watase]
106: 1579| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell's gotten into him!?"]
107: 1584| [45] [There were some things suspicious about Watase, no question about it, but Ukita was taking things way too far.]
108: 1589| [45] [He then suddenly realized that Kazami was staring at the gun in his hands.]
109: 1651| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1654| [45] ["Captain... what are you doing with that pistol...?"]
111: 1662| [47] [Watase]
112: 1665| [45] ["Oh, right, forgot to mention."]
113: 1673| [47] [Watase]
114: 1676| [45] ["I found this lying next to Natsuhiko in Area N."]
115: 1702| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1705| [45] ["O-oh, I see..."]
117: 1710| [45] [It seemed she was scared of the pistol.]
118: 1715| [45] [Watase quickly put it back into his breast pocket and changed the subject.]
119: 1723| [47] [Watase]
120: 1726| [45] ["Anyway, we need to get out of here as quickly as possible."]
121: 1734| [47] [Watase]
122: 1737| [45] ["Now that the old man knows we're here, this place is no longer safe."]
123: 1742| [45] [Natsuhiko's transfusion was still in progress, and Salyu hadn't shown any signs of regaining consciousness.]
124: 1747| [45] [Their lives would be in danger if another fight broke out in the infirmary.]
125: 1755| [47] [Watase]
126: 1758| [45] ["... And Teach is in trouble too."]
127: 1784| [47] [Kazami]
128: 1787| [45] ["You mean Ms. Tsubakiyama? Now that I think about it, where is she?"]
129: 1795| [47] [Watase]
130: 1798| [45] ["I left her in an office in Area 2. It wouldn't be surprising if the old man attacked her too, given the way he was acting just now."]
131: 1806| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1809| [45] ["... Understood. Then let us rendezvous with Ms. Tsubakiyama while we continue Tenkawa's transfusion."]
133: 1814| [45] [Kazami attached the blood pack and transfusion kit to Natsuhiko's body.]
134: 1819| [45] [Watase then carried him, with Kazami doing the same for Salyu, as they all left the room.]
