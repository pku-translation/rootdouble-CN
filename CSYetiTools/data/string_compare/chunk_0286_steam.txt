  1:  104| [45] [------]
  2:  109| [45] [----]
  3:  114| [45] [--]
  4:  174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  175| [45] ["---..."]
  6:  180| [45] [Natsuhiko returned to reality.]
  7:  206| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  209| [45] ["--Are you okay, Hikorin?"]
  9:  214| [45] [Natsuhiko heard Yuuri's voice, but his vision was still blurry.]
 10:  219| [45] [For in his eyes were tears.]
 11:  237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  240| [45] ["... Yuuri."]
 13:  266| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  269| [45] ["I'm sorry. I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time..."]
 15:  274| [45] [Yuuri said the same words she did back then.]
 16:  279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  280| [45] [(Please... please don't say you've deceived me...!)]
 18:  331| [45] [--Natsuhiko had been free for nine years in exchange for Yuuri's confinement.]
 19:  336| [45] [It was an unbearable truth for him.]
 20:  341| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  342| [45] [(Dammit, what the hell's wrong with me...!?)]
 22:  347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  348| [45] [(For years and years, I've been protected by the girls precious to me...)]
 24:  353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  354| [45] [(And I took it all for granted without ever realizing how much they sacrificed for me!)]
 26:  359| [45] [Natsuhiko was tormented by bitterness and shame.]
 27:  377| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  380| [45] ["How... how can you be so nice to me...?"]
 29:  406| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  409| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 31:  417| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  420| [45] ["Even though it's my fault you've wasted nine years of your life..."]
 33:  428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  431| [45] ["You never held a grudge, you never complained, and even today, you worked hard to save me..."]
 35:  439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  442| [45] ["Why? How can you go so far to do all that for someone like me...?"]
 37:  450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  453| [45] ["Why can't you put more value in yourself...!?"]
 39:  458| [45] [Yuuri calmly answered.]
 40:  484| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  487| [45] ["... Hikorin, you see..."]
 42:  495| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  498| [45] ["I thought I would be trapped in here for my entire life."]
 44:  506| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  509| [45] ["So I thought it'd be for the best if you forgot about me and lived a happy life with Mashiron..."]
 46:  535| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  538| [45] ["That's what I believed. That's really all there is to it."]
 48:  543| [45] [Yuuri gave a lonely smile.]
 49:  548| [45] [As if she had given up on something she had long thought to be precious--]
 50:  553| [45] [When he saw that look on her face, Natsuhiko understood her feelings.]
 51:  598| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  599| [45] [(I see... Yuuri... had given up.)]
 53:  604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  605| [45] [(To survive her hopeless days, she gave up every hope of her own future...!)]
 55:  610| [45] [But-- that was not something that a normal person could withstand.]
 56:  615| [45] [In her heart of hearts, Yuuri must have wanted to be saved.]
 57:  620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  621| [45] [(... After all, she did ask me to save her.)]
 59:  626| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  627| [45] [(She asked me, and not anyone else.)]
 61:  632| [45] [And she had appeared before him and made him look into his own mind.]
 62:  637| [45] [She may not have realized it herself, but there was perhaps a slight gap in her reasoning.]
 63:  642| [45] [But Natsuhiko couldn't overlook that.]
 64:  647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  648| [45] [(Others might overlook it, but there's no way I could...!)]
 66:  657| [45] [Natsuhiko wiped his tears and gazed at Yuuri.]
 67:  665| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  668| [45] ["... Say, Yuuri."]
 69:  676| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  679| [45] ["Do you think lost time can be recovered...?"]
 71:  705| [47] [Yuuri]
 72:  708| [45] ["Th-that's..."]
 73:  734| [47] [Yuuri]
 74:  737| [45] ["That's impossible... Even if you change memories, you can't change the truth."]
 75:  742| [45] [--That was an obvious answer.]
 76:  747| [45] [But not one Natsuhiko could approve of.]
 77:  755| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78:  758| [45] ["... No, even so, I'll still do it."]
 79:  784| [47] [Yuuri]
 80:  787| [45] ["Huh?"]
 81:  795| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82:  798| [45] ["I swear I'll recover the time you've lost."]
 83:  806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84:  809| [45] ["You say you'll spend the rest of your life imprisoned in this place? That's ridiculous.%NThat can't be allowed to stand."]
 85:  817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86:  820| [45] ["I swear I'll free you even if it costs me my life."]
 87:  846| [47] [Yuuri]
 88:  849| [45] ["Even if it costs you your life!? No...!"]
 89:  875| [47] [Yuuri]
 90:  878| [45] ["If you die, then what will I have spent all those nine years trying to save you for!?"]
 91:  886| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  889| [45] ["Please, allow me to do at least that..."]
 93:  897| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94:  900| [45] ["I really enjoyed meeting you and spending all that time with you up until today."]
 95:  908| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96:  911| [45] ["If you're telling me that it was all a lie, then I'll just turn that lie into the truth...!"]
 97:  919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98:  922| [45] ["If you say you were a phantom, then I'll change you into reality!"]
 99:  927| [45] [That was the one thing he could do for Yuuri.]
100:  932| [45] [The only way he could repay her for protecting her all these nine years--]
101:  940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102:  943| [45] ["Let's escape from this facility alive, Yuuri."]
103:  951| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104:  954| [45] ["Because I'm sure that's what you really want."]
105: 1015| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1018| [45] ["...!"]
107: 1023| [45] [Yuuri's eyes widened.]
108: 1028| [45] [But eventually, her surprise was painted over with the colors of joy and relief.]
109: 1054| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1057| [45] ["... Yes."]
111: 1062| [45] [That one word signified the sentiment she had locked away in her heart for nine years--%Nher hope for freedom.]
112: 1069| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded firmly and continued.]
113: 1083| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1086| [45] ["... All right. But there's a lot we've gotta do before that."]
115: 1112| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1115| [45] ["You're right. First we need to save Mashiron, right?"]
117: 1123| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1126| [45] ["Yeah. Hopefully she's okay...!"]
119: 1152| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1155| [45] ["... If you're worried, then why don't you use Senses Sympathy on Captain Kasasagi one more time?"]
121: 1163| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1166| [45] ["Huh? You can use Senses Sympathy long distance?"]
123: 1171| [45] [Similar to telepathy and empathy, Senses Sympathy obviously had a usable range of its own.]
124: 1176| [45] [And considering how empathy's range was narrower than telepathy's, Natsuhiko logically concluded that Senses Sympathy would be even narrower, but--]
125: 1202| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1205| [45] ["It is true that you need to be nearly touching when you dive into someone's mind the first time..."]
127: 1231| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1234| [45] ["But minds that have been connected in the past can connect more easily, even from a distance."]
129: 1260| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1263| [45] ["That said, it's still about the same range as empathy, though."]
131: 1271| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1274| [45] ["I-is that how it works?"]
133: 1301| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 1304| [45] ["It's called the 'melt effect'."]
135: 1312| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1315| [45] ["When you use Senses Sympathy on someone, part of your minds melt together, making subsequent uses remarkably easier."]
137: 1382| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 1385| [45] ["When you came to LABO this morning, I was able to connect to your mind even when you were far away, remember?"]
139: 1390| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1393| [45] ["Now that you mention it, you're right..."]
141: 1442| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 1445| [45] ["And what's more, you've been sympathizing with Captain Kasasagi's mind for hours upon hours, haven't you?"]
143: 1479| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1482| [45] ["So I'm sure you should be able to connect to his mind whenever you want now."]
145: 1490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 1493| [45] ["... I see."]
147: 1498| [45] [Having his mind melted together with Watase's wasn't exactly a pleasant thought, but the ability to sympathize with his senses at will was quite convenient.]
148: 1506| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1509| [45] ["Got it. I'll give it a shot."]
150: 1559| [45] [Natsuhiko said that to Yuuri as he attempted using Senses Sympathy on Watase.]
151: 1564| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1565| [45] [(... Where is he now, and what's he doing?)]
153: 1570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 1571| [45] [(Has he reached Mashiro yet...?)]
155: 1677| [45] [Natsuhiko's five senses dampened--]
156: 1682| [45] [And in its place came the sights that Watase saw.]
