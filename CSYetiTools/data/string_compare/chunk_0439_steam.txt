  0:   65| [45] [--It was a story from before Mashiro and Natsuhiko got along--]
  1:   70| [45] [Back then, Mashiro was a boyish girl who bustled about town alongside the boys.]
  2:   75| [45] [The secret base that Mashiro was currently in was also a place they had found while bustling about town.]
  3:  118| [45] [The boys all called her a tomboy.]
  4:  123| [45] [And naturally, the one who started calling her that--]
  5:  153| [45] [Was the dastardly Natsuhiko.]
  6:  158| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  159| [45] [(I'm not gonna let him use this secret base...!)]
  8:  234| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  237| [45] ["Look, whatever you do, don't you ever, ever tell Natsuhiko about this place, okay?"]
 10:  242| [45] [The boys around her nodded to her whispers.]
 11:  247| [45] [Mashiro had taken three boys to the secret base to play.]
 12:  252| [45] [Without telling Natsuhiko, of course.]
 13:  257| [47] [Boy A]
 14:  260| [45] ["I know, but still~..."]
 15:  265| [47] [Boy B]
 16:  268| [45] ["I don't think he'd come even if we did tell him. That Natsuhiko's been acting weird lately."]
 17:  273| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  276| [45] ["Weird? How?"]
 19:  281| [47] [Boy C]
 20:  284| [45] ["Well~ he's been kinda fidgety and he's been looking kinda down. He just doesn't seem like his normal self."]
 21:  289| [47] [Boy B]
 22:  292| [45] ["Someone said they saw him with some mystery girl too, you know?"]
 23:  297| [47] [Boy A]
 24:  300| [45] ["Yeah, I heard that too. She's 'parently in elementary school too."]
 25:  305| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  308| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 27:  313| [45] [Deep down, Mashiro was surprised to hear that.]
 28:  318| [45] [She never heard anything about Natsuhiko getting along with a girl before.]
 29:  323| [45] [It bothered her a little as to what sort of girl she was, but--]
 30:  328| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  329| [45] [(But who cares about that guy! I know I don't, that's for sure!)]
 32:  334| [45] [It was annoying to think about Natsuhiko-related things, so she dropped the matter.]
 33:  339| [47] [Boy C]
 34:  342| [45] ["I bet she's his girlfriend now."]
 35:  347| [47] [Boy C]
 36:  350| [45] ["My sister told me that boys get fidgety when they get girlfriends."]
 37:  355| [47] [Boy A]
 38:  358| [45] ["A girlfriend, huh... Natsuhiko's a perv, huh?"]
 39:  363| [47] [Boy B]
 40:  366| [45] ["Yup, such a perv. Boys who get along with girls are pervs. It's common sense."]
 41:  371| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  374| [45] ["P-pervs...!?"]
 43:  379| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  382| [45] ["... Huh? What does that make you guys?"]
 45:  387| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  390| [45] ["You're with me..."]
 47:  395| [47] [Boy A]
 48:  398| [45] ["But you're not a girl, Mashiro."]
 49:  403| [47] [Boy B]
 50:  406| [45] ["You're a tomboy. Hahahah!"]
 51:  411| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  414| [45] ["Mm, mmm...."]
 53:  419| [45] [Despite her half-hearted answer, Mashiro was irritated on the inside.]
 54:  424| [45] [She didn't know why. She knew she was being teased, but it wasn't just that.]
 55:  429| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  432| [45] ["Well, whatever. Who cares about him?"]
 57:  437| [47] [Mashiro]
 58:  440| [45] ["Hmph!"]
 59:  445| [45] [Mashiro turned her face away with a pout.]
 60:  450| [45] [Whatever the boring reason was, it wasn't like she was going to figure it out like that.]
 61:  510| [45] [--Afterwards, Mashiro left the boys and headed to the park.]
 62:  515| [45] [Despite all the things she'd said, it bothered her to hear about Natsuhiko being with a girl.]
 63:  520| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  523| [45] ["I'll go tease him if they're together! Eeheehee!"]
 65:  528| [47] [Mashiro]
 66:  531| [45] ["I'll make him sorry he ever called me a tomboy!"]
 67:  537| [45] [She held that determination in her heart, and when she actually got to the park--]
 68:  821| [45] [She didn't find Natsuhiko, but a lone cute girl there instead.]
 69:  826| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  827| [45] [(!? Could she be the girl everyone's been talking about...?)]
 71:  832| [45] [Mashiro had never seen that girl before.]
 72:  837| [45] [Even though she pretty much knew all the girls and boys in the neighborhood--]
 73:  842| [45] [So Mashiro decided to call out to her.]
 74:  867| [47] [Mashiro]
 75:  870| [45] ["Hey, are you waiting for Natsuhiko?"]
 76:  896| [47] [Yuuri]
 77:  899| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 78:  904| [45] [The girl slowly turned around to face her.]
 79:  909| [45] [There was something elegant behind that gesture. Mashiro found herself overwhelmed.]
 80:  935| [47] [Yuuri]
 81:  938| [45] ["Yeah. I'm waiting for Natsuhiko."]
 82:  943| [47] [Mashiro]
 83:  946| [45] ["Hmm, I see."]
 84:  951| [47] [Mashiro]
 85:  952| [45] [(She seems a like calm girl... and she's cute, like a doll...)]
 86:  957| [47] [Mashiro]
 87:  960| [45] ["Um... what's your name?"]
 88:  986| [47] [Yuuri]
 89:  989| [45] ["Yuuri. And you...?"]
 90:  994| [47] [Mashiro]
 91:  997| [45] ["Me? I'm Mashiro! Mashiro Toba!"]
 92: 1023| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1026| [45] ["Oh, so you're Mashiro? I've heard about you from Natsuhiko."]
 94: 1031| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1034| [45] ["Huh!? What?"]
 96: 1060| [47] [Yuuri]
 97: 1063| [45] ["Well, he said you're good at getting along with anyone."]
 98: 1089| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1092| [45] ["He said you'd be my friend too!"]
100: 1097| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1100| [45] ["Huh!? Th-that jerk! Don't go deciding things on your own..."]
102: 1126| [47] [Yuuri]
103: 1129| [45] ["Huh... S-so you won't be my friend then...?"]
104: 1134| [47] [Mashiro]
105: 1137| [45] ["Ah, no, that's not it! No, no! I will, I will!"]
106: 1142| [45] [Mashiro found herself unable to say no to Yuuri's puppy dog eyes.]
107: 1147| [45] [But it wasn't as if Mashiro were entirely reluctant.]
108: 1152| [45] [There was something about Yuuri that Mashiro was drawn to as well.]
109: 1157| [47] [Mashiro]
110: 1160| [45] ["Wanna have a chat?"]
111: 1186| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1189| [45] ["Yeah!"]
113: 1273| [45] [The two sat on a bench and talked.]
114: 1278| [45] [During their conversation, Mashiro found herself fascinated by Yuuri's every little gesture.]
115: 1283| [45] [Each gesture was sweet, somewhat subdued, yet quite beautiful.]
116: 1288| [47] [Mashiro]
117: 1289| [45] [(And compared to her...)]
118: 1363| [45] [Mashiro looked at herself.]
119: 1368| [45] [Her suntanned skin. Her plain clothes. She couldn't see herself pulling off such feminine gestures.]
120: 1373| [45] [The only thing she could really pride herself in in the slightest was her hair which her mother tied up for her.]
121: 1378| [45] [That was why Mashiro admired Yuuri and wanted to be her friend.]
122: 1404| [47] [Yuuri]
123: 1407| [45] ["And then... huh?"]
124: 1412| [47] [Mashiro]
125: 1415| [45] ["Hmm? What's wrong?"]
126: 1441| [47] [Yuuri]
127: 1444| [45] ["Oh, you just seemed like you were spacing out a little, so..."]
128: 1470| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1473| [45] ["Was my story boring...?"]
130: 1478| [47] [Mashiro]
131: 1481| [45] ["Huh!? No, not at all! I just had a few things on my mind, that's all!"]
132: 1486| [45] [It was too embarrassing to admit she was fascinated by her.]
133: 1491| [47] [Mashiro]
134: 1494| [45] ["Geez~... you gotta be more confident in yourself, Yuuri!"]
135: 1520| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1523| [45] ["M-mmm... I think so too, but..."]
137: 1528| [47] [Mashiro]
138: 1531| [45] ["But?"]
139: 1554| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1555| [45] ["..."]
141: 1560| [45] [Yuuri paused and hung her head a little--]
142: 1565| [45] [And then she murmured as if she were talking to herself.]
143: 1573| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1576| [45] ["Actually, I..."]
145: 1581| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 1584| [45] ["Yeah?"]
147: 1592| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 1595| [45] ["I've always been worrying... that I'd never have any friends..."]
149: 1603| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 1606| [45] ["Natsuhiko was the first friend I made, but I haven't made any other friends..."]
151: 1614| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 1617| [45] ["So I don't really know how to make friends or anything like that..."]
153: 1622| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 1625| [45] ["Mmm... but you're so cute! That's weird~"]
155: 1630| [45] [Yuuri's eyes opened wide.]
156: 1656| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 1659| [45] ["C-cute...?"]
158: 1664| [47] [Mashiro]
159: 1667| [45] ["H-huh? Did I say something strange?"]
160: 1675| [47] [Yuuri]
161: 1678| [45] ["Awawawah... Nobody's ever told me that before."]
162: 1704| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 1707| [45] ["But you're way cuter than me, Mashiro."]
164: 1712| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 1715| [45] ["Huh? Huh!?"]
166: 1720| [45] [Mashiro was shocked by that unexpected statement.]
167: 1725| [45] [The boys called her a tomboy. So naturally they all treated her like a boy.]
168: 1730| [45] [And as a result, Mashiro unconsciously began to think of herself as one too.]
169: 1735| [45] [So that was the first time she had been told she was "cute", and it really sank deep into her heart.]
170: 1740| [47] [Mashiro]
171: 1743| [45] ["... No! But! You're much cuter, Yuuri!"]
172: 1769| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 1772| [45] ["No, you're the cute one, Mashiro."]
174: 1777| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 1780| [45] ["You're cuter, Yuuri!"]
176: 1806| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 1809| [45] ["No, you are, Mashiro!"]
178: 1814| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 1815| [45] ["..."]
180: 1838| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 1839| [45] ["..."]
182: 1844| [47] [Mashiro]
183: 1847| [45] ["... pfft."]
184: 1873| [47] [Yuuri]
185: 1876| [45] ["Tee hee."]
186: 1881| [47] [Mashiro]
187: 1884| [45] ["We're kinda strange, aren't we?"]
188: 1910| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 1913| [45] ["But we're having fun, aren't we?"]
190: 1918| [47] [Mashiro]
191: 1921| [45] ["Yeah!"]
192: 1926| [45] [Mashiro was quite happy, to be honest.]
193: 1931| [45] [Not only did she make friends with Yuuri, but Yuuri had also told her that she was cute, which made her happier more than anything.]
194: 1936| [47] [Mashiro]
195: 1937| [45] [(Such a cute girl told me I'm cute too...)]
196: 2021| [45] [That day, for the first time in her life, Mashiro felt proud as a girl.]
