  2:   64| [45] [----]
  3:   69| [45] [--But just a while later--]
  4:  126| [85] [{--Just do it like Tachibana and Moribe did--!}]
  5:  127| [86] [Watase]
  6:  128| [86] [{--Just do it like Tachibana and Moribe did--!}]
  7:  143| [85] [{Goddammit... goddammit!}]
  8:  144| [86] [Watase]
  9:  145| [86] [{Goddammit... goddammit!}]
 10:  173| [45] [--]
 11:  178| [45] [----]
 12:  183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  184| [45] [(--?)]
 14:  189| [45] [Though Natsuhiko's consciousness was supposedly gone for good, he heard a voice.]
 15:  246| [85] [{Please... don't die!}]
 16:  247| [86] [Watase]
 17:  248| [86] [{Please... don't die!}]
 18:  276| [45] [And in his nearly-faded consciousness, he rapidly began to regain sight.]
 19:  408| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  409| [45] [(!!!???)]
 21:  414| [45] [He had no idea what was going on.]
 22:  419| [45] [Just that he was face to face with himself.]
 23:  427| [47] [Watase]
 24:  430| [45] ["I... I did it!"]
 25:  435| [45] [With a sigh of relief, Watase held his hand up to Natsuhiko's mouth.]
 26:  440| [45] [He could feel a faint breath on his palm.]
 27:  491| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  492| [45] [(I'm... breathing...?)]
 29:  497| [45] [Natsuhiko blanked out for a few seconds, but the truth of the situation finally hit him.]
 30:  502| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  503| [45] [(You mean... my body's still alive...!?)]
 32:  508| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  509| [45] [(But how!? How could I have survived with all those bullet wounds!?)]
 34:  514| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  515| [45] [(No, more importantly-- Wasn't a nuclear reactor supposed to have melted down here!?)]
 36:  520| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  521| [45] [(So shouldn't that have killed me long ago...!?)]
 38:  526| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  527| [45] [(... Th-then why???)]
 40:  532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  533| [45] [(What the hell's going on!? Am I dreaming!?)]
 42:  538| [45] [But the sensations he felt through Watase's body were no doubt reality.]
 43:  543| [45] [The stench of blood drifting in the air. The numbness of his skin. The intense headache.]
 44:  548| [45] [He could feel his entire body convulsing.]
 45:  553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  554| [45] [(It's not a dream...?)]
 47:  559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  560| [45] [(Then what's going on with me now...?)]
 49:  565| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  566| [45] [(Did... did Watase save me from the brink of death with CPR!?)]
 51:  571| [45] [Natsuhiko's body was alive.]
 52:  576| [45] [And yet his consciousness was still inside Watase.]
 53:  581| [45] [Which-- in Natsuhiko's mind-- could only mean one thing.]
 54:  586| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  587| [45] [(--I see, so maybe!!)]
 56:  592| [45] [At the climax of their fight, Natsuhiko destroyed Watase's memory.]
 57:  597| [45] [But the phantom Yuuri said this back then:]
 58:  821| [85] [{The apex of a Communicator's journey...]
 59:  823| [85] [The ability beyond empathy. The power to connect minds rather than just brains.}]
 60:  824| [86] [Yuuri]
 61:  825| [86] [{The apex of a Communicator's journey... The ability beyond empathy. The power to connect minds rather than just brains.}]
 62:  945| [45] [Indeed. The third ability of BC was not memory destruction:]
 63:  950| [45] [It was the power to connect minds.]
 64:  955| [45] [When Natsuhiko destroyed Watase's memories, their minds were connected!]
 65:  960| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  961| [45] [(So basically, it's not that my BC energy's lingering inside Watase--)]
 67:  966| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  967| [45] [(--it's that our minds have been connected through BC this entire time!?)]
 69:  972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  973| [45] [(Regardless of whether Watase was awake or knocked out!?)]
 71:  978| [45] [That would explain why Natsuhiko was able to interfere with Watase's mind and memory.]
 72:  983| [45] [But the question still remained as to how he was still alive...]
 73:  988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74:  989| [45] [(If this really were a nuclear reactor area, then I definitely would have died ages ago...!)]
 75:  994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  995| [45] [(Which means... there wasn't a nuclear reactor here!?)]
 77: 1000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1001| [45] [(But in that case-- what the hell is this place!?)]
 79: 1006| [45] [Just then, after he had finished resuscitating Natsuhiko, Watase discovered something.]
 80: 1112| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1115| [45] ["Th-this is...!"]
 82: 1120| [45] [Watase picked up a pistol that was lying next to Natsuhiko.]
 83: 1125| [45] [Right as Watase felt its heft--]
 84: 1219| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1222| [45] ["... Ha."]
 86: 1299| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1302| [45] ["Agh, GAAAAAAAH!!"]
 88: 1307| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1308| [45] [(You... you damned monster!)]
 90: 1368| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1369| [45] [(I have to get away... as far away as possible!)]
 92: 1522| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1525| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
 94: 1593| [45] [--Watase's memory of "back then" started coming back.]
 95: 1601| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1604| [45] ["Wha... what the hell was that...!?"]
 97: 1609| [45] [Bewildered by the flashback, Watase stared at Natsuhiko with gaping eyes.]
 98: 1614| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1615| [45] [(O-oh crap...!)]
100: 1620| [45] [But immediately afterwards, Watase himself denied the memories that were trying to come back.]
101: 1677| [85] [{... No way, there's no way that's true!}]
102: 1678| [86] [Watase]
103: 1679| [86] [{... No way, there's no way that's true!}]
104: 1694| [85] [{Anyway, I've gotta get him to a safe place...!}]
105: 1695| [86] [Watase]
106: 1696| [86] [{Anyway, I've gotta get him to a safe place...!}]
107: 1724| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
108: 1730| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1731| [45] [(!?)]
110: 1806| [45] [--he saw Salyu rushing towards him, axe in hand.]
