  0:   70| [45] [--After Natsuhiko fell victim to stupefaction--]
  1:   75| [45] [Mashiro frequently went to the hospital to visit him.]
  2:   80| [45] [She prayed for the day that he'd regain consciousness.]
  3:  116| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  119| [45] ["--Natsuhiko, how're you doing today?"]
  5:  124| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  127| [45] ["Well, today, you see, I was practicing BC, right? I actually successfully used telepathy for the first time!"]
  7:  132| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  135| [45] ["That means I'm finally Ability Level 1. I started using telepathy before you did, Natsuhiko!"]
  9:  140| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  143| [45] ["Aren't I amazing? Heheh."]
 11:  194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  195| [45] ["..."]
 13:  200| [45] [No matter how much Mashiro spoke, Natsuhiko would not respond.]
 14:  260| [45] [--But even so, she would come speak with him as she believed that was the only way to bring him back to reality.]
 15:  325| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  328| [45] ["--Man~ Natsuhiko, I'm so bored this summer break~!"]
 17:  333| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  336| [45] ["Last year we had a test of courage, we freed Sirius, we investigated the Seven Wonders, and lotsa other stuff."]
 19:  420| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  423| [45] ["Good times, huh? Actually, during that test of courage, I heard a ghost's voice, you know?"]
 21:  428| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  431| [45] ["I was too scared to talk about it back then, but it was evidence for one of the wonders. Cool, huh?"]
 23:  436| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  439| [45] ["I kinda wanted to go on a 'solution mission' this year too, but you know--"]
 25:  447| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  450| [45] ["Nothing happens without you around, Natsuhiko. It's soo boring."]
 27:  495| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  496| [45] ["..."]
 29:  545| [45] [But even as time passed, and summer break arrived, nothing changed.]
 30:  595| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  598| [45] ["--Actually, something kinda surprising happened today."]
 32:  603| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  606| [45] ["You see, there's this boy in the other class, and he sent me this letter, and it said he liked me..."]
 34:  611| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  614| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko. What should I do?"]
 36:  659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  660| [45] ["..."]
 38:  709| [45] [Though the world around Mashiro was changing, time remained still for Natsuhiko...]
 39:  760| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  763| [45] ["... I ended up rejecting the boy who sent the letter."]
 41:  768| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  771| [45] ["I mean, I don't really understand all that stuff..."]
 43:  776| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  779| [45] ["... Like what it means to like someone..."]
 45:  784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  785| [45] ["..."]
 47:  836| [45] [Mashiro strained to prevent her world from changing so that she wouldn't slip too far from Natsuhiko's time.]
 48:  901| [45] [--And in the blink of an eye, three months passed...]
 49:  906| [45] [That day, Mashiro visited Natsuhiko's hospital room.]
 50:  960| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  963| [45] ["--Today at school, the boys were asking if you were still in the hospital."]
 52:  968| [47] [Mashiro]
 53:  971| [45] ["Your mom doesn't let anyone else visit but me, you see."]
 54:  976| [47] [Mashiro]
 55:  979| [45] ["Everyone's really worried since they haven't seen you in three months. You really are popular, you know."]
 56:  984| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  985| [45] ["..."]
 58:  990| [45] [Still no response.]
 59:  995| [47] [Mashiro]
 60:  998| [45] ["... Everyone's waiting for you to be discharged."]
 61: 1003| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1004| [45] ["..."]
 63: 1009| [45] [No matter how much she talked to him, there was no response.]
 64: 1061| [47] [Mashiro]
 65: 1062| [45] ["..."]
 66: 1116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1117| [45] ["..."]
 68: 1122| [45] [Eventually--]
 69: 1127| [47] [Mashiro]
 70: 1130| [45] ["... Hey."]
 71: 1135| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1138| [45] ["... Say something, Natsuhiko...!"]
 73: 1143| [45] [Her voice wrung out from the bottom of her heart and echoed through the hospital room.]
 74: 1237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1238| [45] ["..."]
 76: 1243| [47] [Mashiro]
 77: 1246| [45] ["I'm waiting... for you to come back, Natsuhiko..."]
 78: 1305| [47] [Mashiro]
 79: 1308| [45] ["Now that Yuuri's gone... I've been all alone..."]
 80: 1313| [45] [Mashiro suddenly realized just how much her own voice was trembling.]
 81: 1318| [45] [Her vision had blurred before she noticed.]
 82: 1323| [47] [Mashiro]
 83: 1326| [45] ["... Natsuhiko..."]
 84: 1331| [45] [Mashiro touched Natsuhiko's cheek.]
 85: 1416| [45] [She could feel his body warmth through the palm of her hand.]
 86: 1421| [45] [--He was warm. Blood was flowing through his veins.]
 87: 1426| [45] [He was certainly there right in front of her, and yet they couldn't exchange words.]
 88: 1431| [45] [Even though she could touch him, his mind was somewhere else, far away--]
 89: 1436| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1439| [45] ["... Natsuhiko..."]
 91: 1444| [45] [Mashiro touched his lips.]
 92: 1449| [45] [She brushed up his hair.]
 93: 1466| [45] [She brought her own lips close to his--...]
 94: 1473| [45] [But stopped.]
 95: 1478| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1479| [45] [(... What am I doing...?)]
 97: 1484| [45] [This wasn't some fairy tale. There was no way that'd wake Natsuhiko up.]
 98: 1489| [45] [He wouldn't wake up no matter what she did.]
 99: 1494| [45] [Mashiro muttered without expecting any response.]
100: 1499| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1502| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko."]
102: 1507| [47] [Mashiro]
103: 1510| [45] ["I'm so lonely... I want to play with you like we did back then."]
104: 1515| [45] [More tears spilled as she uttered those words.]
105: 1523| [45] [He was right there, yet they couldn't exchange words.]
106: 1528| [45] [She could only guess what he was thinking.]
107: 1533| [45] [Mashiro whispered by herself in the tiny room.]
108: 1538| [47] [Mashiro]
109: 1541| [45] ["... It's so lonely, Natsuhiko..."]
110: 1546| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1549| [45] ["... I want to play with you like we did back then."]
112: 1554| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1557| [45] ["I want to fight with you over stupid things...!"]
114: 1562| [45] [Mashiro was already past the point where she had any hope for an answer.]
115: 1568| [45] [Her sobs echoed through the quiet hospital room.]
116: 1614| [45] [--But then--]
117: 1619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1620| [45] ["..."]
119: 1625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1628| [45] ["... Ugh..."]
121: 1633| [45] [She heard the voice she had been waiting to hear.]
122: 1687| [47] [Mashiro]
123: 1690| [45] ["--Huh?"]
124: 1695| [45] [Mashiro gasped.]
125: 1714| [45] [And looked at Natsuhiko in disbelief.]
126: 1719| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1722| [45] ["... ah...?"]
128: 1727| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around, confused.]
129: 1732| [45] [The light had returned to his eyes.]
130: 1737| [45] [Eventually, those eyes fell on Mashiro--]
131: 1742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1745| [45] ["... M... Mashiro...?"]
133: 1750| [45] [He called out her name.]
134: 1755| [47] [Mashiro]
135: 1758| [45] ["----Na--"]
136: 1763| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 1766| [45] ["Natsuhiko!"]
138: 1771| [45] [Natsuhiko twitched at the sudden shout.]
139: 1782| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1785| [45] ["Huh, wh-what...? No, where... am I...?"]
141: 1790| [45] [Natsuhiko appeared unaware that he was in a hospital.]
142: 1795| [45] [Mashiro grasped Natsuhiko's hand and answered.]
143: 1800| [47] [Mashiro]
144: 1803| [45] ["You're in the hospital! You don't remember!?"]
145: 1808| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 1811| [45] ["Ah... th-that's right..."]
147: 1816| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 1819| [45] ["Yuuri and I got caught in the fire in LABO..."]
149: 1824| [47] [Mashiro]
150: 1827| [45] ["Yeah, yeah...!"]
151: 1832| [45] [He appeared to be gradually recalling the circumstances.]
152: 1837| [45] [Mashiro softly spoke to him, holding back all the words she wanted to say so they wouldn't overflow.]
153: 1842| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 1845| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you've been in the hospital ever since then, you know?"]
155: 1850| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 1853| [45] ["I've been coming here to visit you..."]
157: 1909| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1912| [45] ["I-I see... Thank you."]
159: 1917| [47] [Mashiro]
160: 1920| [45] ["It's not that big a deal. What matters is that you're back..."]
161: 1976| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1979| [45] ["I'm sorry... I must've made you worry."]
163: 1984| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke apologetically.]
164: 1989| [45] [Mashiro wiped her tears and smiled.]
165: 1994| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 1997| [45] ["I said it's no big deal."]
167: 2002| [47] [Mashiro]
168: 2005| [45] ["More importantly, I gotta call the professor. She needs to know you've woken up!"]
169: 2059| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2062| [45] ["That's true. Besides--"]
171: 2068| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled as he spoke.]
172: 2073| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2076| [45] ["I'm sure Yuuri's worried too."]
174: 2081| [45] [--The air froze in the hospital room.]
175: 2086| [47] [Mashiro]
176: 2089| [45] ["... Huh?"]
177: 2094| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2097| [45] ["Yuuri. She should be waiting for me at home."]
179: 2102| [47] [Mashiro]
180: 2105| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko...?"]
181: 2116| [45] [An ominous premonition arose from the pit of Mashiro's stomach.]
182: 2121| [45] [She asked him again in a rough voice.]
183: 2126| [47] [Mashiro]
184: 2129| [45] ["What... makes you say that...?"]
185: 2183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
186: 2186| [45] ["Well, I just remembered what happened when they carried me to the hospital."]
187: 2191| [47] [Natsuhiko]
188: 2194| [45] ["I nearly died from breathing too much smoke... but Yuuri was safe, wasn't she?"]
189: 2248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2251| [45] ["So Mom told me Yuuri didn't have to be hospitalized."]
191: 2256| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 2259| [45] ["...!"]
193: 2264| [45] [--That was an impossible memory.]
194: 2269| [45] [Natsuhiko had shut his mind after he learned about Yuuri's death.]
195: 2274| [45] [But Natsuhiko appeared to believe what he had just said from the bottom of his heart.]
196: 2279| [47] [Mashiro]
197: 2282| [45] ["H-hey, Natsuhiko...? You didn't forget, did you?"]
198: 2336| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 2339| [45] ["Hmm? Forget what?"]
200: 2344| [47] [Mashiro]
201: 2347| [45] ["You see, Yuuri's already..."]
202: 2352| [47] [Mashiro]
203: 2355| [45] ["Sh... she's already gone, you know...?"]
204: 2409| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2412| [45] ["--?"]
206: 2417| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Mashiro with blank eyes.]
207: 2422| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2425| [45] ["Gone... gone where?"]
209: 2430| [47] [Mashiro]
210: 2433| [45] ["Huh...? Like I said, because of the fire..."]
211: 2438| [47] [Mashiro]
212: 2441| [45] ["Yuuri breathed in too much smoke... and she died..."]
213: 2446| [45] [Once Mashiro repeated herself,]
214: 2502| [47] [Natsuhiko]
215: 2505| [45] ["... Ugh!"]
216: 2510| [45] [Natsuhiko suddenly grimaced.]
217: 2515| [47] [Mashiro]
218: 2518| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko!? What's wrong!?"]
219: 2523| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 2526| [45] ["M-my head just started to...!"]
221: 2531| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2534| [45] ["Uuuuuuugh...! It hurts...!"]
223: 2539| [47] [Mashiro]
224: 2542| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Are you okay, Natsuhiko!?"]
225: 2547| [45] [Natsuhiko groaned for a while--]
226: 2552| [45] [But eventually his face slackened as if he were at peace.]
227: 2608| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 2611| [45] ["Ah... it doesn't hurt anymore..."]
229: 2616| [47] [Mashiro]
230: 2619| [45] ["I-I see. That's good..."]
231: 2624| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 2627| [45] ["What was that just now...?"]
233: 2632| [45] [Natsuhiko tilted his head.]
234: 2686| [47] [Mashiro]
235: 2687| [45] ["..."]
236: 2692| [45] [Mashiro had no answer.]
237: 2697| [45] [She had the feeling-- that Natsuhiko's headache was no ordinary headache.]
238: 2702| [45] [Mashiro's body trembled from an unknown fear.]
239: 2793| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 2796| [45] ["... Well, whatever. Anyway, gotta go call them."]
241: 2801| [47] [Mashiro]
242: 2804| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
243: 2809| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 2812| [45] ["We gotta tell them I'm awake, right? Besides..."]
245: 2817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 2820| [45] ["'I'm sure Yuuri's worried too.'"]
247: 2825| [45] [--Once she heard those words, Mashiro finally understood:]
248: 2830| [45] [Natsuhiko still had not returned to reality.]
249: 2835| [45] [He had become emotionally unstable...!]
250: 2848| [47] [Mashiro]
251: 2851| [45] ["... Natsuhiko."]
252: 2856| [45] [Mashiro called out his name.]
253: 2861| [45] [She called out the name of her friend who looked the same on the outside, but was completely different.]
254: 2866| [45] [The tears she had wiped away had come back.]
255: 2912| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 2915| [45] ["...?"]
257: 2920| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at her quizzically.]
258: 2925| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 2928| [45] ["... Mashiro, why are you crying?"]
260: 2934| [45] [------]
261: 2939| [45] [----]
262: 2944| [45] [--]
263: 3152| [45] [--Perhaps some parts of those memories didn't actually happen.]
264: 3157| [45] [Were the true events how Natsuhiko remembered them...]
265: 3162| [45] [Or what I just now saw of how Mashiro remembered them...?]
266: 3167| [45] [There's no longer any way to know for sure.]
267: 3172| [45] [But a new memory of Mashiro's floats now before me--]
268: 3177| [45] [A memory she had locked away alongside her intense feelings for Natsuhiko...]
