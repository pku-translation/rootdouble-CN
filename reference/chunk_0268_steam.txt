  1:  101| [45] [--By the time he reached Area N, Watase was already tattered and beaten.]
  2:  163| [45] [Kazami had struck him in the arm with a fire extinguisher.]
  3:  223| [45] [Jun appeared and he had to run away.]
  4:  283| [45] [Ukita shot him in the flank.]
  5:  342| [45] [And once he finally arrived in Area N, what was waiting for him was--]
  6:  419| [47] [Watase]
  7:  422| [45] ["...!"]
  8:  427| [45] [Abnormal symptoms including skin discomfort, headache, and convulsing fingertips.]
  9:  432| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  433| [45] [(No, Watase! It's too dangerous here!)]
 11:  438| [45] [The manual they'd found in the engine room even had this to say:]
 12:  443| [45] [8000 mSv-: unconsciousness]
 13:  448| [45] [The contamination level in Area N was far beyond that.]
 14:  453| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  454| [45] [(Khh-- If the contamination level's that high, then the device inside here really must be that WX particle amplifier!)]
 16:  459| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  460| [45] [(Is this device the reason the facility's "mSv" values have been increasing!?)]
 18:  465| [45] [Once Natsuhiko was convinced of that connection, a sudden realization hit him.]
 19:  471| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  472| [45] [(!!!)]
 21:  477| [45] ["AD" "Procyon" "contaminated zone" "WX particle amplifier" "WX particle" "BC's third ability"]
 22:  482| [45] [The scattered puzzle pieces inside of Natsuhiko rapidly connected into one.]
 23:  487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  488| [45] [(Ah, ah, aahh...!)]
 25:  493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  494| [45] [(I... I got it! I've solved one of the mysteries!)]
 27:  499| [45] [The answer he finally found was the true nature of the facility.]
 28:  510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  511| [45] [(... I've been connected to Watase for six hours using "BC's third ability".)]
 30:  516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  517| [45] [(But whenever he administered "AD", the connection would halt, and when he entered a%N"contaminated zone", it would resume.)]
 32:  522| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  523| [45] [(So in other words, the "AD" that LABO made is a drug that inhibits my BC abilities--)]
 34:  528| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  529| [45] [(The "WX particles" spreading around LABO have the opposite effect as AD: they augment my BC abilities!)]
 36:  534| [45] [And in the dead center of the high-security LABO was a "WX particle amplifier".]
 37:  539| [45] [And the "Procyon", the device that measured the WX particles, was built by LABO as well.]
 38:  544| [45] [The Procyon, the AD, the WX particles... everything relates to BC--!]
 39:  549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  550| [45] [(Which means... which means LABO!!)]
 41:  635| [85] [　%N　%N]
 42:  639| [47] [Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, Number 1:]
 43:  645| [47] [LABO does not conduct nuclear power research.]
 44:  650| [47] [They research arms production]
 45:  656| [47] [--and other dangerous, national matters--]
 46:  671| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
 47:  675| [47] [--LABO does not conduct nuclear power research--]
 48:  681| [47] [--other dangerous, national matters--]
 49:  752| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  753| [45] [(--So LABO really isn't a nuclear power research lab at all!)]
 51:  758| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  759| [45] [(It's a facility for researching "WX particles" and "BC abilities"!!)]
 53:  764| [45] [Natsuhiko finally arrived at that truth-- and at that very same moment--]
 54:  931| [45] [Kazami appeared on the other side of the still-open gate. The fire extinguisher was still in her hands.]
 55:  939| [47] [Watase]
 56:  942| [45] ["!!"]
 57:  978| [45] [Watase panicked and operated the terminal.]
 58: 1032| [45] [The gate quickly began to close.]
 59: 1039| [45] [But before it could finish, Kazami slipped through--]
 60: 1131| [47] [Watase]
 61: 1134| [45] ["Gagh!!"]
 62: 1158| [45] [--and swung the fire extinguisher down right onto Watase's head.]
 63: 1163| [45] [Sparks filled his vision and his body shook left and right.]
 64: 1208| [45] [But Watase mustered the last of his strength--]
 65: 1225| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1228| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAH!"]
 67: 1254| [45] [And pushed Kazami right out of Area N.]
 68: 1354| [47] [Kazami]
 69: 1357| [45] ["Watase! Wataseee!"]
 70: 1365| [47] [Kazami]
 71: 1368| [45] ["OPEN THE GATE, WATASE!"]
 72: 1373| [45] [Kazami's voice drowned out behind the gate.]
 73: 1452| [45] [And at the same time, Watase crumbled down, sending Natsuhiko's body flinging off him.]
 74: 1523| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1524| [45] [(Khh...)]
 76: 1619| [45] [As Watase's consciousness faded, several questions flickered in his mind.]
 77: 1636| [45] [Why did he lose his memory? Why were the nine of them locked inside the facility?%NWhy did that survivor keep running away from him?]
 78: 1641| [45] [Why was there no fire and no nuclear reactor in Area N, but rather Natsuhiko on the brink of death instead? Why did Yuuri's body disappear?--]
 79: 1658| [45] [--Several answers to those questions lay within Natsuhiko.]
 80: 1663| [45] [The amnesia and the contradictory memories were caused by Natsuhiko's abilities.]
 81: 1680| [45] [The reason Salyu ran away from Watase was obviously because he was a terrorist.]
 82: 1685| [45] [The reason "Yuuri" ran away was probably the same.]
 83: 1734| [45] [And the reason why there were no fires and no nuclear reactor in Area N was because the facility researched WX particles and BC.]
 84: 1739| [45] [But even Natsuhiko had six lingering questions of his own that he could not solve.]
 85: 1791| [45] [Who conducted the murders inside LABO?]
 86: 1841| [45] [Who was the girl killed in front of the cargo lift?]
 87: 1891| [45] [Who was the girl called "Yuuri", who looked exactly like the Yuuri he knew?]
 88: 1939| [45] [Who took away the stockpile of AD?]
 89: 1987| [45] [Where did Ena go?]
 90: 2030| [45] [But what he understood the least was--]
 91: 2179| [45] [Why did those three people go mad one by one?]
 92: 2225| [45] [--He thought he heard someone whisper "Try to remember".]
 93: 2272| [45] [It felt like a voice rising up from Natsuhiko's heart of hearts.]
 94: 2283| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 2284| [45] [(That's right... Try to remember! The answer has to be in something I've seen so far.)]
 96: 2295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 2296| [45] [(The answer to the unsolved mystery...!)]
 98: 2307| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko recalled Rokumei City's Seven Wonders.]
 99: 2392| [85] [　%N　%N]
100: 2396| [47] [Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, Number 5:]
101: 2402| [47] [If a Communicator uses BC without knowing the proper way,]
102: 2408| [47] [--they will eventually turn into]
103: 2413| [47] [a mind-broken monster--]
104: 2428| [85] [　%N　%N]
105: 2432| [47] [Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, Number 6:]
106: 2438| [47] [Monsterified people are captured by a secret task force]
107: 2443| [47] [working under Rokumei City's Security Department]
108: 2449| [47] [--and are imprisoned underground--]
109: 2464| [85] [　%N　%N]
110: 2468| [47] [Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, Number 7:]
111: 2474| [47] [If a Communicator]
112: 2479| [47] [excessively misuses BC--]
113: 2485| [47] [--their target's mind will eventually break--]
114: 2595| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't understand why he was suddenly reminded of these wonders.]
115: 2605| [45] [However--]
116: 2638| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 2639| [45] [(If all of those are true, then...!)]
118: 2670| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 2671| [45] [(If there's a monster locked underground here causing everyone's minds to go crazy, then--!]
120: 2702| [45] [--It was too out there to call it a theory. It was nothing more than a simple guess.]
121: 2733| [45] [But Natsuhiko thought:]
122: 2764| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 2765| [45] [(I don't know if monsters like that exist...)]
124: 2796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 2797| [45] [(I don't know who's at fault here...)]
126: 2828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 2829| [45] [(I don't know what the hell is going on here...!)]
128: 2860| [45] [--He knew that he couldn't let it end like this.]
129: 2890| [45] [There was no way he could leave things as-is, without understanding a thing.]
130: 2901| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2902| [45] [(Then I'll investigate! I'll find out exactly what's going on here!)]
132: 2907| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2908| [45] [(I can't leave everything to Watase anymore. I can't remain a mere spectator--)]
134: 2913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2914| [45] [(--I'm throwing down the gauntlet!)]
136: 2919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2920| [45] [(If the two of us work together, we can do this--!!)]
138: 2968| [45] [The moment he made his brave decision--]
139: 2973| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness returned to his body.]
140: 3060| [45] [His own five senses returned.]
141: 3065| [45] [His sight, his hearing, his touch, his smell, his taste, and his pain all awoke inside his body.]
142: 3073| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 3076| [45] ["!!"]
144: 3081| [45] [And immediately afterwards, he felt a burning pain singe through his bullet wounds.]
145: 3086| [45] [It was genuine pain that he had to grit his teeth to bear.]
146: 3094| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 3097| [45] ["--...gh!!"]
148: 3102| [45] [But Natsuhiko bore the pain nonetheless. He focused all the strength he could muster into his heavy limbs--]
149: 3137| [45] [--and slowly but surely, he stood up.]
150: 3142| [45] [The blood transfusion needle fell out, but he paid no heed to that...]
151: 3147| [45] [... and stepped up to Watase.]
152: 3265| [45] [When he heard Natsuhiko's footsteps, Watase peeled his heavy eyes open.]
153: 3273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 3276| [45] ["--Get up."]
155: 3284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 3287| [45] ["None of this is over yet...!"]
157: 3333| [45] [Six towering devices stood in the vast Area N.]
158: 3338| [45] [As they made their mechanical whirring sounds--]
159: 3343| [45] [An intense, resolute voice shook the cool air.]
160: 3351| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 3354| [45] ["You and I will save everyone from this nightmare...!"]
