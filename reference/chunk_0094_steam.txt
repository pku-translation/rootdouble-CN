  1:  119| [45] [Watase came to his senses, only to realize he was pinning Salyu down.]
  2:  124| [47] [Watase]
  3:  125| [45] [(Wha...?)]
  4:  130| [45] [The actions he'd taken just now had clearly been etched into him instinctively through training.]
  5:  135| [45] [But they were obviously not skills needed to save lives.]
  6:  140| [47] [Watase]
  7:  141| [45] [(Where did I ever pick up a skill like that..?)]
  8:  146| [45] [Salyu glared up at him, her eyes seething like cold blue flames.]
  9:  151| [45] [Watase shook off the chills running down his spine and tried reasoning with her.]
 10:  159| [47] [Watase]
 11:  162| [45] ["... Why did you attack me?"]
 12:  167| [47] [Salyu]
 13:  168| [45] ["..."]
 14:  176| [47] [Watase]
 15:  179| [45] ["Please tell me! I don't have the slightest idea why!"]
 16:  226| [45] [Salyu's eyes moved just then.]
 17:  231| [45] [Her gaze was now focused on Natsuhiko.]
 18:  239| [47] [Watase]
 19:  242| [45] ["... Wait, was it because you thought I attacked Natsuhiko?"]
 20:  250| [47] [Watase]
 21:  253| [45] ["If that's what it is, then you've got it all wrong!"]
 22:  263| [47] [Watase]
 23:  266| [45] ["I was about to take him to the infirmary before you attacked."]
 24:  274| [47] [Watase]
 25:  277| [45] ["I swear I wasn't going to hurt him more than he already is."]
 26:  282| [45] [Salyu then spoke in a near inaudible voice.]
 27:  332| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  335| [45] ["...top it."]
 29:  343| [47] [Watase]
 30:  346| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 31:  351| [45] [Watase brought his face closer to hers to hear her better.]
 32:  359| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  362| [45] ["Even I can see through your thinly veiled lies. Stop it."]
 34:  370| [47] [Watase]
 35:  373| [45] ["Wha--!? What are you--"]
 36:  378| [45] [But Salyu moved her right hand as fast as lightning before Watase could finish.]
 37:  504| [47] [Watase]
 38:  507| [45] ["Ugh!"]
 39:  512| [45] [She poked him in the eyes, temporarily blinding him.]
 40:  517| [45] [Watase felt Salyu slipping her body out from under him at the same time.]
 41:  522| [47] [Watase]
 42:  523| [45] [(Crap! I've gotta put some distance between us!)]
 43:  528| [45] [Watase had no way of dodging any axe swings at this time.]
 44:  533| [47] [Watase]
 45:  534| [45] [(Shit, shit, shit!)]
 46:  539| [45] [Watase blindly stretched out his hands in the darkness.]
 47:  544| [45] [His left hand came into contact with something.]
 48:  549| [45] [It was the sensation of cloth- a sleeve. Watase grabbed onto it and focused solely on pulling it towards him.]
 49:  557| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  560| [45] ["Ah!"]
 51:  565| [45] [Salyu's gasp echoed through the darkness.]
 52:  570| [45] [Watase kept clutching on to her with his left hand while his right hand remained free.]
 53:  575| [47] [Watase]
 54:  576| [45] [(I have to defeat her right here and now!)]
 55:  581| [45] [Watase's body, spurred on by his ever-growing fear, filled with fierce strength.]
 56:  591| [45] [He reluctantly clenched his hand into a fist so he could knock her unconscious when--]
 57:  649| [85] [{Stop! Don't hurt her!}]
 58:  650| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 59:  651| [86] [{Stop! Don't hurt her!}]
 60:  679| [45] [The auditory hallucination showed up again.]
 61:  687| [47] [Watase]
 62:  690| [45] ["!!"]
 63:  695| [45] [Watase came back to his senses and opened his raised fist.]
 64:  700| [45] [He then slipped behind Salyu and locked her into a chokehold.]
 65:  843| [47] [Salyu]
 66:  846| [45] ["L-let me go!"]
 67:  851| [45] [Salyu struggled. Watase's vision hadn't returned yet.]
 68:  856| [47] [Watase]
 69:  857| [45] [(Khh... I'm sorry about this!)]
 70:  882| [45] [Watase mentally apologized to Salyu as he applied pressure to her thin neck.]
 71:  887| [45] [All while being careful not to squeeze it too hard.]
 72:  948| [47] [Salyu]
 73:  951| [45] ["Gah, ack...!"]
 74: 1009| [47] [Salyu]
 75: 1010| [45] ["--..."]
 76: 1030| [45] [All the strength in her body soon faded away.]
 77: 1035| [45] [Watase let out a great big sigh once he'd confirmed this-- then loosened his grip.]
 78: 1050| [45] [His sight soon came back.]
 79: 1055| [45] [He could see Salyu was passed out cold in his grip.]
 80: 1060| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1061| [45] [(Th-that was too close... she really -did- want to kill me...!)]
 82: 1066| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1067| [45] [(But... anyway, what can I do for her now...?)]
 84: 1072| [45] [His head and skin still hurt like hell. His convulsions also hadn't let up.]
 85: 1077| [45] [He didn't know why, but his instincts were screaming that it was too dangerous for him to stay here too long.]
 86: 1085| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1088| [45] ["I've gotta get these two out of here...!"]
 88: 1093| [45] [Watase carried Natsuhiko and Salyu.]
 89: 1122| [45] [--They were heavy.]
 90: 1127| [45] [Watase's body truly was in poor shape if they felt that way to him.]
 91: 1132| [45] [He staggered out of Area N along with Natsuhiko and Salyu.]
 92: 1258| [45] [He left through the same door he'd come through.]
 93: 1263| [45] [And when he made his way out to the connecting passageway--]
 94: 1328| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1331| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 96: 1336| [45] [He found Kazami standing there.]
 97: 1344| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1347| [45] ["!"]
 99: 1373| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1376| [45] ["Thank God... you're all right."]
101: 1384| [47] [Watase]
102: 1387| [45] ["Tachibana... what are you doing here...?"]
103: 1392| [45] [Watase was cautious of Kazami after what had transpired back in the surveillance room.]
104: 1418| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1421| [45] ["Well, umm... I was worried about you, so..."]
106: 1429| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1432| [45] ["So I checked the surveillance cameras and saw you going into Area N...!"]
108: 1458| [47] [Kazami]
109: 1461| [45] ["But... what in the world happened with those two!?"]
110: 1466| [45] [Kazami was looking at Natsuhiko and Salyu with shock.]
111: 1474| [47] [Watase]
112: 1477| [45] ["Oh... you mean Natsuhiko and Salyu. They're unconscious for now."]
113: 1503| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1506| [45] ["Where did you..."]
115: 1514| [47] [Watase]
116: 1517| [45] ["I found Natsuhiko collapsed in Area N."]
117: 1525| [47] [Watase]
118: 1528| [45] ["My guess is that Salyu probably followed me in there..."]
119: 1554| [47] [Kazami]
120: 1557| [45] ["Wait, he was collapsed in Area N...? But isn't that where the burning nuclear reactor is!?"]
121: 1565| [47] [Watase]
122: 1568| [45] ["No... I don't get why either, but..."]
123: 1576| [47] [Watase]
124: 1579| [45] ["There was nothing like that in Area N."]
125: 1605| [47] [Kazami]
126: 1608| [45] ["--Huh!?"]
127: 1613| [45] [That revelation left Kazami speechless.]
128: 1618| [45] [But Watase had figured she'd have a hard time believing that. So he handed her his Level N card.]
129: 1626| [47] [Watase]
130: 1629| [45] ["You'll understand better if you see it for yourself. Go ahead."]
131: 1655| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1658| [45] ["..."]
133: 1678| [45] [Kazami nodded dubiously, then took the card and ran towards Area N.]
134: 1684| [45] [--About thirty seconds later-]
135: 1695| [45] [Kazami came back quickly and immediately started talking.]
136: 1729| [47] [Kazami]
137: 1732| [45] ["I don't believe it... how is this even...!?"]
138: 1738| [45] [Watase nodded as he took the Level N card back from her.]
139: 1746| [47] [Watase]
140: 1749| [45] ["Yeah... it looks like we were being duped by someone from the start."]
141: 1775| [47] [Kazami]
142: 1778| [45] ["B-but that machine... It's probably something other than a nuclear reactor..."]
143: 1783| [45] [It appeared Kazami also believed that the giant machine in Area N was no reactor.]
144: 1788| [45] [However--]
145: 1796| [47] [Watase]
146: 1799| [45] ["... Tachibana, let's save the explanations and discussions for later."]
147: 1807| [47] [Watase]
148: 1810| [45] ["We need to treat Natsuhiko as soon as possible before it's too late."]
149: 1815| [45] [Kazami looked at Natsuhiko and nodded.]
150: 1841| [47] [Kazami]
151: 1844| [45] ["You're right, he's bleeding very badly...! It looks like he'll need a blood transfusion."]
152: 1852| [47] [Watase]
153: 1855| [45] ["Then let's head on over to the infirmary. They've got blood packs and a transfusion kit there."]
154: 1881| [47] [Kazami]
155: 1884| [45] ["Roger that. Then I'll carry one of the children."]
156: 1892| [47] [Watase]
157: 1895| [45] ["Can you do it with that leg of y--"]
158: 1921| [47] [Kazami]
159: 1924| [45] ["I've recovered quite a bit. I think I can manage."]
160: 1929| [45] [Kazami pressed against the wound in her leg and carried Salyu.]
161: 1955| [47] [Kazami]
162: 1958| [45] ["But if this facility doesn't have a nuclear reactor... then what in the world is this place...?"]
163: 1966| [47] [Watase]
164: 1969| [45] ["... I don't know. I don't have the slightest clue...!"]
165: 1974| [45] [Those words came straight from the bottom of Watase's heart.]
