  0:   64| [45] [--After they reunited with Watase in Area 1--]
  1:   69| [45] [The group rescued "Yuuri", a civilian who'd been caught up in the accident...]
  2:  117| [45] [... but Watase had lost his memories.]
  3:  122| [45] [Jun hadn't especially liked him since he was always blunt and cold, but she was worried about him this one time.]
  4:  127| [45] [--Be that as it were, they reformed the team and continued the search.]
  5:  195| [45] [They then saved a woman stuck in the connecting passageway between Areas 2 and 3.]
  6:  200| [45] [But she grew very angry after she was told about the situation and started harping on the group.]
  7:  284| [47] [Ena]
  8:  287| [45] ["No way... What do you mean, 'the bulkheads are shut'!?"]
  9:  313| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  316| [45] ["We can't figure out why it happened either...!"]
 11:  342| [47] [Ena]
 12:  345| [45] ["Then why don't you just destroy the damn thing with some sort of special equipment or something!?"]
 13:  353| [47] [Jun]
 14:  356| [45] ["We've tried everything we can! But not even our engine cutter could make a dent in that thing!"]
 15:  382| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  385| [45] ["We can't destroy the bulkhead with any of the equipment we have on hand."]
 17:  411| [47] [Ena]
 18:  414| [45] ["Hmph! I never thought a rescue squad could be this useless!"]
 19:  470| [47] [Jun]
 20:  473| [45] ["...!"]
 21:  499| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  502| [45] ["It's true that -we- can't destroy it with our equipment-- but the workers on the surface should have explosives with them."]
 23:  510| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  513| [45] ["So it's only a matter of time before that bulkhead is destroyed and reinforcements come.%NSo please try to understand for now."]
 25:  539| [47] [Ena]
 26:  542| [45] ["... I see, then I guess there's nothing you can do about it."]
 27:  547| [45] [The woman let out an exasperated sigh.]
 28:  919| [47] [Jun]
 29:  922| [45] ["Hey, cut the crap, lady!"]
 30:  975| [47] [Ena]
 31:  978| [45] ["Huh?"]
 32:  991| [47] [Jun]
 33:  994| [45] ["How about being a little more thankful we saved you?"]
 34: 1047| [47] [Ena]
 35: 1050| [45] ["Oh my, whatever do you mean? Isn't saving lives what we pay you people for?"]
 36: 1078| [47] [Ena]
 37: 1081| [45] ["It's only a given that you're supposed to save people on the job."]
 38: 1148| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 39: 1227| [47] [Jun]
 40: 1230| [45] ["Now wait just a minute, lady...!"]
 41: 1235| [45] [Unable to sit back and let her continue berating them, Jun planned to give the woman a warning, but Kazami held her back.]
 42: 1261| [47] [Kazami]
 43: 1264| [45] ["More importantly, we need to give her some AD."]
 44: 1290| [47] [Watase]
 45: 1293| [45] ["Oh, you're right! She'll be in big trouble without it!"]
 46: 1319| [47] [Ena]
 47: 1322| [45] ["AD? What's that?"]
 48: 1330| [47] [Kazami]
 49: 1333| [45] ["Well you see, it's--"]
 50: 1402| [45] [Kazami explained AD to the woman.]
 51: 1407| [45] [She also told her about the radiation filling the facility, the danger standards, and the Procyon.]
 52: 1412| [45] [The woman's attitude took a complete 180 after she'd heard all that.]
 53: 1445| [47] [Ena]
 54: 1448| [45] ["R-radiation...!?"]
 55: 1456| [47] [Kazami]
 56: 1459| [45] ["That's correct. Furthermore, subjective symptoms of radiation damage easily appear in the internal organs, skin, and eyes."]
 57: 1467| [47] [Kazami]
 58: 1470| [45] ["Are you experiencing any nausea, skin pain, or blurry vision?"]
 59: 1496| [47] [Ena]
 60: 1499| [45] ["No, I think I'm feeling okay..."]
 61: 1525| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1528| [45] ["Good. Then you'll be fine as long as we give you some AD now."]
 63: 1536| [47] [Jun]
 64: 1539| [45] ["But you'd better do it quick, you hear? If you don't, then you won't be around to keep telling us off like that."]
 65: 1565| [47] [Ena]
 66: 1568| [45] ["O... okay. Then all I have to do is inject myself with this?"]
 67: 1576| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1579| [45] ["Righto, now that's better."]
 69: 1584| [45] [She wasn't thrilled by the woman's attitude, but Jun decided to let it go for now.]
 70: 1589| [45] [She felt that it was her natural duty as a rescue worker.]
 71: 1701| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1704| [45] ["Hey, cut the crap, lady!"]
 73: 1730| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1733| [45] ["Huh?"]
 75: 1741| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1744| [45] ["How about being a little more thankful we saved you?"]
 77: 1770| [47] [Ena]
 78: 1773| [45] ["Oh my, whatever do you mean? Isn't saving lives what we pay you people for?"]
 79: 1799| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1802| [45] ["It's only a given that you're supposed to save people on the job."]
 81: 1825| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1828| [45] ["..."]
 83: 1833| [45] [Jun was speechless.]
 84: 1838| [45] [There were many who thanked them for their efforts.]
 85: 1843| [45] [But for rescue workers, that gratitude was the greatest reward they received for their hard and arduous work.]
 86: 1848| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1849| [45] [(Maybe I am being a bit full of myself for expecting a reward...)]
 88: 1854| [47] [Jun]
 89: 1855| [45] [(But she's going too far!)]
 90: 1860| [45] [Jun was hurt by the woman's thoughtless words-- and also felt extremely resentful towards them.]
 91: 1909| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
 92: 1914| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1915| [45] [(... Was Prof. Tsubakiyama always this nasty from Jun's perspective?)]
 94: 1920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1921| [45] [(I guess I have to increase her positive feelings towards Prof. Tsubakiyama or it won't work...)]
