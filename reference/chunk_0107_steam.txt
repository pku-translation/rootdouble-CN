  1:   73| [47] [Kazami]
  2:   76| [45] ["Don't do it, Captain! Come back!"]
  3:   90| [45] [Kazami's shouts echoed throughout the stairwell.]
  4:   95| [47] [Watase]
  5:   96| [45] [(It'll be fine! My body should be strong enough to make down to the bottom before it collapses!)]
  6:  101| [45] [Watase clung to his self-confidence as he ran down--]
  7:  106| [45] [--But felt nothing.]
  8:  111| [47] [Watase]
  9:  112| [45] [(???)]
 10:  117| [45] [Once he realized he couldn't feel the ground, Watase's eyes darted down.]
 11:  122| [45] [What he saw was the wreckage of the staircase that had fallen just before he had.]
 12:  187| [47] [Watase]
 13:  190| [45] ["!!"]
 14:  195| [45] [He suddenly felt like he was floating.]
 15:  209| [45] [--No, not floating! Falling!]
 16:  217| [47] [Watase]
 17:  220| [45] ["--!"]
 18:  256| [45] [Watase immediately grabbed the handrail and hung from it.]
 19:  261| [45] [However--]
 20:  287| [45] [Before him was a twisted landscape comprised of a crushed iron frame, iron plates, and reinforcing bars that looked like something straight out of a nightmare.]
 21:  292| [45] [Everything that the eye could see had crumbled apart.]
 22:  303| [45] [--And a second later, the world sunk with a creak.]
 23:  311| [47] [Watase]
 24:  314| [45] ["!!!"]
 25:  364| [45] [And then it began to collapse.]
 26:  376| [45] [Bolts and nuts popped off.]
 27:  381| [45] [Countless debris fell to the earth.]
 28:  386| [45] [And Watase was in the middle of it all.]
 29:  394| [47] [Watase]
 30:  397| [45] ["--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
 31:  402| [45] [The ground grew closer.]
 32:  407| [45] [And closer.]
 33:  412| [45] [And closer.]
 34:  417| [45] [--AAAH!]
 35:  446| [45] [The impact turned into a flash that shot right through Watase's consciousness.]
 36:  451| [45] [--Just then...]
 37:  463| [45] [Something hit Watase's back with a thump.]
 38:  468| [45] [No, something had pierced his chest.]
 39:  473| [45] [--HaVE I bEEn SKewEREd?]
 40:  478| [45] [But he could no longer move his body to find that out.]
 41:  487| [45] [Debris just kept relentlessly raining down on him.]
 42:  492| [45] [Crushing his hands,]
 43:  497| [45] [his feet,]
 44:  502| [45] [his shoulders,]
 45:  507| [45] [and then--]
 46:  588| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  591| [45] ["Everyone, turn back! The staircase is collapsing!"]
 48:  651| [45] [--a moment after Kazami's voice played back in his mind--]
 49:  656| [45] [--his head.]

 51:  753| [45] [√A Bad Ending #6 [The Fallen]]
 52:  756| [85] [　]
 53:  759| [45] [The result of ignoring Kazami's warnings and worrying too much about Ena.]
 54:  762| [85] [　]
 55:  765| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Kazami's Senses higher than Ena's at the SSS input just before this ending.]
