  1:   28| [45] [The team climbed down the rope at the staircase and returned to the factory on B2--]
  2:   78| [45] [--only to find the others running towards them.]
  3:  158| [47] [Jun]
  4:  161| [45] ["Captain! What happened!?"]
  5:  169| [47] [Ena]
  6:  172| [45] ["We heard this strange thump..."]
  7:  180| [47] [Watase]
  8:  183| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
  9:  211| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  214| [45] ["More importantly, did you find any survivors?"]
 11:  240| [47] [Jun]
 12:  243| [45] ["Well... no."]
 13:  321| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  324| [45] ["Captain! Did something happen!?"]
 15:  332| [47] [Ena]
 16:  335| [45] ["We heard this strange thump..."]
 17:  343| [47] [Watase]
 18:  346| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
 19:  374| [47] [Jun]
 20:  377| [45] ["Anyways, did you guys find the survivors?"]
 21:  403| [47] [Ena]
 22:  406| [45] ["Unfortunately... no."]
 23:  484| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  487| [45] ["Captain! Did something happen?"]
 25:  495| [47] [Jun]
 26:  498| [45] ["We heard this loud thump!"]
 27:  506| [47] [Watase]
 28:  509| [45] ["Oh, it was no big deal. Just the connecting passageway collapsing, that's all."]
 29:  537| [47] [Ena]
 30:  540| [45] ["Anyway, did you find those kids?"]
 31:  566| [47] [Jun]
 32:  569| [45] ["Well... no."]
 33:  688| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  691| [45] ["We made sure to leave no stone unturned, but we found not even a trace of the survivors."]
 35:  699| [47] [Yuuri]
 36:  702| [45] ["Um, did you find anyone in the inner ring...?"]
 37:  710| [47] [Watase]
 38:  713| [45] ["No, no one on our end either."]
 39:  718| [45] [The group had already finished exploring all the areas in LABO.]
 40:  723| [45] [But they hadn't found the survivors anywhere-- not even any bodies of them.]
 41:  731| [47] [Watase]
 42:  734| [45] ["Then... I guess there's no doubt about it."]
 43:  762| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  765| [45] ["Huh?"]
 45:  773| [47] [Watase]
 46:  776| [45] ["They already escaped through the cargo lift!"]
 47:  805| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  808| [45] ["Yes, that would make sense...!"]
 49:  813| [45] [Jun and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
 50:  839| [47] [Jun]
 51:  842| [45] ["Cargo lift? What're you talking about?"]
 52:  868| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  871| [45] ["It appears that there's a lift somewhere in the factory that we can use to escape to the surface."]
 54:  879| [47] [Watase]
 55:  882| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
 56:  887| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
 57:  913| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  916| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
 59:  942| [47] [Ena]
 60:  945| [45] ["Yeah, if we use this, we can get out of here...!"]
 61:  953| [47] [Watase]
 62:  956| [45] ["Right? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
 63:  982| [47] [Jun]
 64:  985| [45] ["No, we didn't... but maybe that's what -that- was!"]
 65: 1070| [45] [Jun turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
 66: 1075| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
 67: 1088| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1091| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
 69: 1117| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1120| [45] ["Well, it was bugging us too. I mean, it just looked so out of place. So we checked it, but..."]
 71: 1128| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1131| [45] ["... we can't get in because the security slot burned up in the fire."]
 73: 1158| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1161| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
 75: 1187| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1190| [45] ["If there really is a cargo lift, then it must be there!"]
 77: 1217| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1220| [45] ["Oh yeah, of course! That makes total sense!"]
 79: 1225| [45] [Kazami and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
 80: 1251| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1254| [45] ["Cargo lift? What do you mean?"]
 82: 1280| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1283| [45] ["It looks like there's a lift in the factory we can use to escape to the surface!"]
 84: 1291| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1294| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
 86: 1299| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
 87: 1325| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1328| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
 89: 1354| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1357| [45] ["Yes, it's possible to get out this way...!"]
 91: 1365| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1368| [45] ["Right!? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
 93: 1394| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1397| [45] ["No, we did not... but perhaps that's what -that- was."]
 95: 1482| [45] [Kazami turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
 96: 1487| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
 97: 1500| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1503| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
 99: 1529| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1532| [45] ["We found it strange as well. It didn't seem to fit with everything else, so we investigated it, but..."]
101: 1540| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1543| [45] ["We couldn't get in because the security slot was burned in the fire, so we gave up on searching it."]
103: 1570| [47] [Ena]
104: 1573| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
105: 1599| [47] [Ena]
106: 1602| [45] ["If there really is a cargo lift, then it must be there!"]
107: 1629| [47] [Ena]
108: 1632| [45] ["Yes! Th-that makes sense!"]
109: 1637| [45] [Jun and the others looked confused at Watase's proclamation.]
110: 1663| [47] [Jun]
111: 1666| [45] ["Cargo lift? What're you talking about?"]
112: 1674| [47] [Watase]
113: 1677| [45] ["It looks like there's a lift in the factory we can use to escape to the surface!"]
114: 1685| [47] [Watase]
115: 1688| [45] ["Here, take a look at this!"]
116: 1693| [45] [Watase said that and showed the disaster prevention manual he'd found earlier to the others.]
117: 1719| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1722| [45] ["I see... I never knew we had something like that!"]
119: 1748| [47] [Kazami]
120: 1751| [45] ["Yes, it's possible to get out this way...!"]
121: 1759| [47] [Watase]
122: 1762| [45] ["Right!? So did any of you guys find anything that looked like a lift in the factory?"]
123: 1788| [47] [Jun]
124: 1791| [45] ["No, we didn't... but maybe that's what -that- was!"]
125: 1876| [45] [Jun turned around and looked at a corner of the factory.]
126: 1881| [45] [She was staring at the farthest wall from them-- where, for some reason, a security gate stood.]
127: 1894| [47] [Watase]
128: 1897| [45] ["... What's a security gate doing in a random place like that?"]
129: 1923| [47] [Kazami]
130: 1926| [45] ["We found it strange as well. It didn't seem to fit with everything else, so we investigated it, but..."]
131: 1934| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1937| [45] ["We couldn't get in because the security slot was burned in the fire, so we gave up on searching it."]
133: 1964| [47] [Jun]
134: 1967| [45] ["But past that gate is the only part of the factory we haven't searched yet."]
135: 1993| [47] [Jun]
136: 1996| [45] ["If there's a cargo lift, then it's gotta be there!"]
137: 2042| [47] [Watase]
138: 2045| [45] ["...!"]
139: 2051| [45] [The whole group was all smiles.]
140: 2056| [45] [They only had six AD, but if they managed to escape, then they wouldn't need them anymore.]
141: 2061| [45] [Their journey full of hardships was finally coming to an end!]
142: 2069| [47] [Watase]
143: 2072| [45] ["All right! Then let's find a way to open that gate!"]
144: 2134| [47] [Ena]
145: 2137| [45] ["Couldn't we use the air ducts to get over it like that other time?"]
146: 2164| [47] [Kazami]
147: 2167| [45] ["Unfortunately, the ceiling is too high up, so we don't have a way to get in there."]
148: 2175| [47] [Watase]
149: 2178| [45] ["Then what if we used the engine cutter to break down the gate?"]
150: 2206| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2209| [45] ["We already tried that. We went back to the makeshift base and got it."]
152: 2235| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2238| [45] ["But seeing as how the cutter failed to make even a dent in it, that gate must be quite sturdy."]
154: 2265| [47] [Jun]
155: 2268| [45] ["We already tried that. We even went back to the makeshift base just to get it."]
156: 2294| [47] [Jun]
157: 2297| [45] ["But it didn't even put a dent in that gate. We'll need something a lot stronger than that."]
158: 2305| [47] [Watase]
159: 2308| [45] ["Great, just great!"]
160: 2334| [47] [Yuuri]
161: 2337| [45] ["... How can we open it...?"]
162: 2342| [45] [Watase looked at Yuuri.]
163: 2347| [47] [Watase]
164: 2348| [45] [(Dammit, the exit's right in front of us...!)]
165: 2353| [47] [Watase]
166: 2354| [45] [(We have to get that gate open no matter what it takes... so that we can save Yuuri!)]
167: 2359| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
168: 2385| [45] [--he and everyone else suddenly heard a strange noise.]
