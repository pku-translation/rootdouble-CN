  1:   99| [45] [--The BC Training Center.]
  2:  104| [45] [It was a sort of gym provided for people who wished to hone their BC skills.]
  3:  109| [45] [The three of them stopped a man about to enter the building to ask him about the objectionable literature.]
  4:  114| [47] [Trainer]
  5:  117| [45] ["Huh, the content of the objectionable literature?"]
  6:  143| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  146| [45] ["Yes. We just want to know a bit about it."]
  8:  151| [45] [He was a trainer for the center who seemed to be in his early 20s.]
  9:  156| [45] [The trainer looked at the kids suspiciously.]
 10:  161| [47] [Trainer]
 11:  164| [45] ["Before that, what are you kids? Some junior detective team?"]
 12:  190| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  193| [45] ["Yes! Something like that. We're allies of justice moving through town to protect the peace of all its citizens."]
 14:  198| [47] [Trainer]
 15:  201| [45] ["Hmm, I didn't think there were still kids that played games like that."]
 16:  206| [47] [Trainer]
 17:  209| [45] ["Well, you kids are cute, so I'll give it to you easy. Just don't tell anyone else, okay?"]
 18:  214| [45] [He looked at Mashiro and Salyu and spoke with a broad grin on his face.]
 19:  219| [47] [Trainer]
 20:  222| [45] ["Well, I guess it basically went like this:"]
 21:  227| [47] [Trainer]
 22:  230| [45] ["'Participate in any further proliferation of BC and punishment shall be bestowed upon you.' What a stiff and humorless guy, eh."]
 23:  235| [47] [Trainer]
 24:  238| [45] ["They stuffed the postbox with that message. By the way, I was the first to find it.%NMan, was it ridiculous."]
 25:  246| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  249| [45] ["Huh... so you mean you didn't feel any sort of sense of impending crisis?"]
 27:  254| [47] [Trainer]
 28:  257| [45] ["Like hell I did. Well, I did send a report to the security department, I guess. But that just backfired and caused a disturbance on its own."]
 29:  262| [45] [As she heard the trainer's story, Mashiro whispered into Natsuhiko's ear.]
 30:  316| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  319| [45] ["So it really was an anti-BC letter then..."]
 32:  327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  330| [45] ["Yeah, I guess..."]
 34:  335| [45] [As the two of them were having that private discussion, this time Salyu asked a question.]
 35:  361| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  364| [45] ["The report caused a disturbance?"]
 37:  369| [47] [Trainer]
 38:  372| [45] ["Well, you see, those guys at the security department pressed in in droves.%NFor our 'defense', apparently."]
 39:  426| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  429| [45] ["But it was just objectionable literature. Did it really warrant that much of a disturbance?"]
 41:  434| [47] [Trainer]
 42:  437| [45] ["Well, I can't say I don't understand where the security department was coming from.%NAfter all, the objectionable literature was signed--"]
 43:  544| [47] [Trainer]
 44:  547| [45] ["--By none other than 'Q'."]
 45:  676| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  679| [45] ["Q!?"]
 47:  684| [45] [Mashiro shook as she heard that letter.]
 48:  692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  695| [45] ["What's wrong, Mashiro? Why the sudden outburst?"]
 50:  721| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  724| [45] ["What's Q?"]
 52:  729| [47] [Trainer]
 53:  732| [45] ["Woah, woah, have you kids been living under a rock? They're infamous on the net, you know?"]
 54:  740| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  743| [45] ["Well, I don't really use the net that much..."]
 56:  769| [47] [Mashiro]
 57:  772| [45] ["... I'll explain it to you guys later. Anyway, Mr. Trainer, did Q do anything afterwards?"]
 58:  777| [47] [Trainer]
 59:  780| [45] ["Beats me. But I doubt those Q freaks would bother targeting a facility as shabby as this. It could've just been some sort of imitator."]
 60:  785| [45] [The way he spoke about Q made them seem like some giant sort of organization.]
 61:  790| [45] [As Natsuhiko fell into confused silence, the trainer continued.]
 62:  795| [47] [Trainer]
 63:  798| [45] ["Well, that's about all I can talk about. The security department rounded up all the objectionable literature, so it's no longer here."]
 64:  824| [47] [Mashiro]
 65:  827| [45] ["I see... Well, thank you very much."]
 66:  832| [47] [Trainer]
 67:  835| [45] ["So long, my allies of justice."]
 68:  840| [45] [And with that, the trainer entered the building.]
 69:  845| [45] [Leaving Natsuhiko and Salyu to quickly ask Mashiro the pressing question.]
 70:  853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  856| [45] ["So, Mashiro. What was that all about? What was... Kyuu, was it?"]
 72:  882| [47] [Mashiro]
 73:  885| [45] ["Well, you see, Q is..."]
 74:  890| [45] [Mashiro made a meek face as she explained the organization to Natsuhiko and Salyu.]
 75:  916| [47] [Mashiro]
 76:  919| [45] ["Q is the largest domestic extremist organization that operates on anti-Communicator sentiments."]
 77:  927| [47] [Mashiro]
 78:  930| [45] ["They're apparently a dangerous group whose activities include bomb threats and coercion.%NAnd depending on the situation, they don't hesitate to use direct action."]
 79:  938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  941| [45] ["... An organization like that exists?"]
 81:  946| [45] [He obviously knew of the existence of anti-BC protest groups and ideology.]
 82:  951| [45] [But he had never heard of an organization that operated at a level dangerous enough to be called extremists and terrorists.]
 83:  977| [47] [Mashiro]
 84:  980| [45] ["Well, I guess it's understandable to not have heard of them... I mean, it's not the most searchable of names."]
 85: 1006| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1009| [45] ["But they do exist for certain though, right?"]
 87: 1035| [47] [Mashiro]
 88: 1038| [45] ["Yeah... it would make sense if the voice I heard on the bus was that of a Q member."]
 89: 1064| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1067| [45] ["A dangerous thought like 'ending this town's history' certainly is something that Q would agree with."]
 91: 1075| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1078| [45] ["You say that, but have there been any concrete instances of them performing any destructive acts?"]
 93: 1105| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1108| [45] ["There have. I mean..."]
 95: 1134| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1137| [45] ["I'm sure you've seen the aftermath of one such incident yourself, Natsuhiko."]
 97: 1145| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1148| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 99: 1156| [47] [Mashiro]
100: 1159| [45] ["It's a little far, but why don't we head over there?"]
101: 1164| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered that question for a second before nodding.]
102: 1169| [45] [Chills running down his spine the whole time--]
