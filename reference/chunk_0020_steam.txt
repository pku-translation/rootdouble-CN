  1:   54| [45] [--The group entered Area 4's inner ring on floor B1.]
  2:   59| [45] [What they found there was essentially the spitting image of Area 3.]
  3:   64| [45] [Jun checked her Procyon.]
  4:  126| [47] [Jun]
  5:  129| [45] ["Contamination level is at '2164 mSv' right now... so it really is climbing up and up."]
  6:  137| [47] [Watase]
  7:  140| [45] ["Then we need to hur--"]
  8:  145| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
  9:  156| [45] [a voice suddenly came out of his PDA.]
 10:  167| [47] [Commander]
 11:  170| [45] ["--... his is Sirius Commander Murakami. Kasasagi, do you r-- ...sagi, do you read me?"]
 12:  178| [47] [Watase]
 13:  181| [45] ["Th-the radio!?"]
 14:  205| [45] [Kazami quickly reacted to Watase's surprise.]
 15:  213| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  216| [45] ["I reported you were unharmed earlier, which is probably why he's contacting you and not me."]
 17:  224| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  227| [45] ["Please answer him."]
 19:  235| [47] [Watase]
 20:  238| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
 21:  335| [45] [Watase frantically took his PDA out and replied.]
 22:  343| [47] [Watase]
 23:  346| [45] ["Y-Yeah, this is Kasasagi, over."]
 24:  351| [47] [Commander]
 25:  354| [45] ["--sasagi... been trying to reach you for a...--... finally got thro..."]
 26:  359| [45] [The radio waves were clearly in worse condition than they'd been in the earlier call.]
 27:  364| [45] [The commander started relaying orders with what little he could get through.]
 28:  369| [47] [Commander]
 29:  372| [45] ["--...eport your status!"]
 30:  380| [47] [Watase]
 31:  383| [45] ["R-right! Actually, uh, we found bodies..."]
 32:  388| [47] [Commander]
 33:  391| [45] ["... was that!? Didn't catch all--"]
 34:  399| [47] [Watase]
 35:  402| [45] ["We found three corpses in the facility!"]
 36:  410| [47] [Watase]
 37:  413| [45] ["And they'd all been murdered! One of them was Dojima...!"]
 38:  418| [47] [Commander]
 39:  421| [45] ["What!?"]
 40:  429| [47] [Watase]
 41:  432| [45] ["Can you hear me!? We found the bodies of Dojima and two researchers! They'd all been murdered!"]
 42:  437| [47] [Commander]
 43:  440| [45] ["...urdered!? ...--"]
 44:  448| [47] [Watase]
 45:  451| [45] ["There were bullet holes in the bodies! The killer might have escaped the facility!"]
 46:  459| [47] [Watase]
 47:  462| [45] ["Please check to make sure that none of the people who exited the facility have guns on them!"]
 48:  467| [47] [Commander]
 49:  470| [45] ["Had--....-- gun--...--"]
 50:  478| [47] [Watase]
 51:  481| [45] ["Can you hear me!? I repeat!"]
 52:  489| [47] [Watase]
 53:  492| [45] ["Please check to make sure that none of the people who exited the facility have guns on them!"]
 54:  497| [47] [Commander]
 55:  500| [45] ["--... Check--...--... for guns, right!? --derstood, leave it-- ..."]
 56:  505| [45] [It seemed he'd managed to get the abnormality of the situation through to the commander.]
 57:  510| [47] [Commander]
 58:  513| [45] ["--...reaking up aga--...--... have a message for you."]
 59:  518| [45] [The commander went for a change of plans, speaking without waiting for any responses.]
 60:  523| [47] [Commander]
 61:  526| [45] ["... of LABO's-- ...vivors...-- ..."]
 62:  531| [47] [Commander]
 63:  534| [45] ["--mongst the surv--...--...--... protect-- ...e--"]
 64:  542| [47] [Watase]
 65:  545| [45] ["What!?"]
 66:  550| [47] [Commander]
 67:  553| [45] ["Put-- ...riority--... on protecting the g...--...--"]
 68:  561| [47] [Watase]
 69:  564| [45] ["I can't hear you, Commander! Please repeat that!"]
 70:  569| [47] [Commander]
 71:  572| [45] ["--gir... nam...--! ..."]
 72:  577| [47] [Commander]
 73:  580| [45] ["...--... protect her...--..."]
 74:  588| [47] [Watase]
 75:  591| [45] ["Protect a girl!? Are you talking about Yuuri!?"]
 76:  596| [47] [Commander]
 77:  599| [45] ["Counting on y--... --rk together with Tachibana and Moribe ...--...--...--..."]
 78:  607| [47] [Watase]
 79:  610| [45] ["You're telling me to work with them to rescue the survivors, aren't you!?"]
 80:  615| [45] [Watase glanced at Kazami and Jun, who both gave him deep nods.]
 81:  623| [47] [Watase]
 82:  626| [45] ["Got it, just leave it to me!"]
 83:  631| [47] [Commander]
 84:  634| [45] ["--ounting o-- ...--...--..."]
 85:  639| [47] [Commander]
 86:  642| [45] ["--...--"]
 87:  647| [45] [The transmission cut there.]
 88:  652| [45] [Watase put his PDA away and turned to the rest of the group.]
 89:  681| [47] [Watase]
 90:  684| [45] ["... Did you guys catch all that?"]
 91:  710| [47] [Kazami]
 92:  713| [45] ["You don't even have to ask. Let's hurry up with the search of Area 4."]
 93:  782| [47] [Jun]
 94:  785| [45] ["Hey Mr. Ukita, what kind of area is this?"]
 95:  811| [47] [Ukita]
 96:  814| [45] ["Oh, we call it the 'Brain'."]
 97:  823| [47] [Ukita]
 98:  826| [45] ["The reason why is because this is where we handle most of the data processing, and because we have a supercomputer in here called 'Brain Cell'."]
 99:  834| [47] [Watase]
100:  837| [45] ["A supercomputer? Where is it?"]
101:  863| [47] [Ukita]
102:  866| [45] ["The mainframe itself is in the outer ring, but it's controlled from right here in the inner ring."]
103:  874| [47] [Ukita]
104:  877| [45] ["It's this way. Follow me."]
105:  882| [45] [The group trailed behind Ukita as he lead the way.]
106:  926| [45] [He guided them to a nearby door that read "System Control Room".]
107:  983| [45] [As soon as he opened the door, the sight of giant screens built into the walls flooded their eyes.]
108:  988| [45] [Vast amounts of what appeared to be data flickered on and off at dizzying speeds.]
109: 1014| [47] [Jun]
110: 1017| [45] ["Whoa, feels like a military command center."]
111: 1086| [47] [Ena]
112: 1089| [45] ["What kind of machine is this?"]
113: 1097| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1100| [45] ["Ah, well, Brain Cell takes care of the batch processing of all the information handled by LABO."]
115: 1108| [47] [Watase]
116: 1111| [45] ["When you say 'all the information', exactly what are we talking about here?"]
117: 1137| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1140| [45] ["I mean everything, from test data analysis, calculations, and even infrastructure systems like the electricity, the lighting system, the AC, the plumbing, and so on."]
119: 1148| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1151| [45] ["It still operates even during a Case N. Look at these numbers here."]
121: 1156| [45] [Ukita pointed to some numbers on the edge of the screen.]
122: 1161| [45] [The time "18:16" and the number "14581 mSv" were sitting there side-by-side.]
123: 1169| [47] [Ukita]
124: 1172| [45] ["'18:16' refers to the time the lockdown is scheduled to lift at."]
125: 1180| [47] [Watase]
126: 1183| [45] ["Just another 8 hours or so, huh...?!"]
127: 1211| [47] [Jun]
128: 1214| [45] ["Looks like the estimate the commander gave us was more or less on the mark, then."]
129: 1240| [47] [Ukita]
130: 1243| [45] ["Indeed. He said that the engineers were currently repairing the system from the surface--"]
131: 1251| [47] [Ukita]
132: 1254| [45] ["But that data is calculating the 'time it'll take for the repairs to be done and for the lockdown to be lifted'."]
133: 1280| [47] [Ena]
134: 1283| [45] ["Is it possible that the lockdown will be lifted before the estimated time?"]
135: 1309| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1312| [45] ["H-hmm... it probably won't be easy. The majority of the processing necessary for the system's restoration is carried out by Brain Cell here."]
137: 1320| [47] [Ukita]
138: 1323| [45] ["This estimate itself was made by Brain Cell. Even if the time is off slightly due to some artificial error, I doubt that they can get it done faster than this."]
139: 1331| [47] [Watase]
140: 1334| [45] ["I see... then what about this '14581 mSv' thing? What's that about?"]
141: 1360| [47] [Ukita]
142: 1363| [45] ["Huh? Oh, that's--"]
143: 1368| [45] [Ukita hesitated for a moment before he spoke.]
144: 1394| [47] [Ukita]
145: 1397| [45] ["... That's the radiation level in Area N."]
146: 1405| [47] [Watase]
147: 1408| [45] ["What!? Area N's contamination is already -that- bad--!?"]
148: 1413| [45] [Watase shuddered.]
149: 1418| [45] [The thought that nearly 15000 mSv of radiation was floating around Area N left him unable to even breathe.]
150: 1423| [45] [It was a land of death where even a single step would most likely cost one their life...!]
151: 1449| [47] [Ukita]
152: 1452| [45] ["It appears that Area N's dosimeter is still active... but maybe we would have been better off not knowing."]
153: 1460| [47] [Watase]
154: 1463| [45] ["N-no, it's better to be safe than sorry. We would have needed to know just how dangerous Area N was eventually."]
155: 1490| [47] [Jun]
156: 1493| [45] ["Yeah... guess that's LABO's 'Elephant's Foot', huh?"]
157: 1501| [47] [Watase]
158: 1504| [45] ["Elephant's Foot?"]
159: 1530| [47] [Jun]
160: 1533| [45] ["That's what they called the place with the highest radiation levels in the Chernobyl nuclear accident."]
161: 1541| [47] [Jun]
162: 1544| [45] ["Its highest level was approximately 80,000 mSv. They say that anyone who was close to it died in just a few seconds."]
163: 1570| [47] [Jun]
164: 1573| [45] ["Of course, the numbers this time around are much better compared to that, but still..."]
165: 1581| [47] [Watase]
166: 1584| [45] ["So now we're positive that we'll be screwed if we ever go to Area N...!"]
167: 1589| [45] [The difference between 15,000 mSv and 80,000 mSv didn't mean a whole lot when it came to radiation.]
168: 1594| [45] [They were both still extremely lethal doses.]
169: 1599| [45] [Both Chernobyl and LABO were crazy worlds where abnormal levels of radiation flew around freely.]
170: 1625| [47] [Ukita]
171: 1628| [45] ["... Anyway, I'm glad that Brain Cell is still functioning even in this horrid situation."]
172: 1636| [47] [Ukita]
173: 1639| [45] ["This place also controls the opening and shutting of the security gates. So if this ever broke, then our search would be at a permanent end."]
174: 1665| [47] [Kazami]
175: 1668| [45] ["Wait, the gates are controlled by this? So that means--"]
176: 1694| [47] [Kazami]
177: 1697| [45] ["Could we possibly open the bulkhead from here!?"]
178: 1723| [47] [Ukita]
179: 1726| [45] ["!"]
180: 1731| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened when they heard Kazami's proposal.]
181: 1739| [47] [Watase]
182: 1742| [45] ["M-Mr. Ukita, can it be done!?"]
183: 1750| [47] [Ukita]
184: 1753| [45] ["I don't know! But... it's still worth a try!"]
185: 1838| [45] [Ukita walked up to the control booth and spoke.]
186: 1871| [47] [Ukita]
187: 1874| [45] ["I'll take care of this. The rest of you should continue with the search. There's no reason for all of us to stay here, after all."]
188: 1882| [47] [Watase]
189: 1885| [45] ["All right! Then let's search Area 4 while he's checking on the bulkhead angle!"]
190: 1918| [47] [Kazami]
191: 1921| [45] ["Yes!"]
192: 1962| [47] [Ena]
193: 1965| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, we're counting on you!"]
194: 1979| [45] [The group left Ukita behind and exited the system control room.]
195: 2034| [45] [As soon as they left, Kazami addressed the others.]
196: 2096| [47] [Kazami]
197: 2099| [45] ["Then let's split into groups of two again!"]
198: 2107| [47] [Watase]
199: 2110| [45] ["Who'll go with who!?"]
200: 2118| [47] [Kazami]
201: 2121| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri and I will go together. I'll keep her under proper supervision."]
202: 2148| [47] [Yuuri]
203: 2151| [45] ["Huh...?"]
204: 2177| [47] [Kazami]
205: 2180| [45] ["Though that said, you don't have to do all that much. So long as you help out only when I'm sure it's safe enough, that's good enough for me."]
206: 2206| [47] [Yuuri]
207: 2209| [45] ["O... okay."]
208: 2214| [45] [Yuuri obediently nodded her head.]
209: 2293| [47] [Jun]
210: 2296| [45] ["Then everyone else with me, okay?"]
211: 2304| [47] [Watase]
212: 2307| [45] ["Yeah!"]
213: 2334| [47] [Ena]
214: 2337| [45] ["This does seem like a good balance."]
215: 2416| [47] [Kazami]
216: 2419| [45] ["Then we'll search this floor, so I'd like to ask the rest of you to search B2."]
217: 2429| [47] [Watase]
218: 2432| [45] ["Got it! We'll find some AD and give it to you, just you wait!"]
219: 2458| [47] [Kazami]
220: 2461| [45] ["--I'd appreciate that."]
221: 2470| [47] [Watase]
222: 2473| [45] ["Yeah... I mean, if we don't find some AD soon, I'll be in deep shit."]
223: 2499| [47] [Kazami]
224: 2502| [45] ["Right, then let's hurry!"]
225: 2507| [45] [With those words serving as a signal to all of them, the group then split up to begin their search.]
