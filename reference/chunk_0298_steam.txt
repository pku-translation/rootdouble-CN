  0:   90| [45] [--The name of the man who had told Watase the truth at the ruins of the hospital was Keiji Ukita.]
  1:   95| [45] [On that day, he left Watase with the words "if you want to be one of our comrades, then feel free to contact me at any time".]
  2:  100| [45] [Watase wracked his mind over what to do all throughout the next month--]
  3:  105| [45] [--and then finally contacted Ukita.]
  4:  174| [45] [--They secretly met at the same place as last time-- the ruins of the hospital.]
  5:  179| [45] [Watase arrived there shortly after leaving work. Before long, Ukita also showed up with a tense look on his face.]
  6:  218| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  221| [45] ["It's been a long time, Mr. Kasasagi."]
  8:  247| [47] [Ukita]
  9:  250| [45] ["Have you decided to become one of us?"]
 10:  258| [47] [Watase]
 11:  261| [45] ["No... I wanna ask you something before that."]
 12:  287| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  290| [45] ["What's that?"]
 14:  298| [47] [Watase]
 15:  301| [45] ["Why are you betraying LABO?"]
 16:  309| [47] [Watase]
 17:  312| [45] ["I can't trust a man who'd betray his own organization without first hearing a clear reason that I can accept."]
 18:  317| [45] [A bitter look rose to Ukita's face when he heard that question.]
 19:  373| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  376| [45] ["... Because I hate the way LABO does things. That's all."]
 21:  381| [45] [A floral scent wafted through the air when Ukita said that.]
 22:  389| [47] [Watase]
 23:  392| [45] ["What? But aren't you guys the ones who are abducting Communicators and using them for human experimentation?"]
 24:  418| [47] [Ukita]
 25:  421| [45] ["No, that's only done by a small number of employees known as 'Senior Fellows'-- high ranked researchers, in other words."]
 26:  447| [47] [Ukita]
 27:  450| [45] ["Junior Fellows-- normal researchers-- like me know that LABO is a BC research facility, but don't know about the test subjects."]
 28:  476| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  479| [45] ["But I accidentally discovered the truth, you see..."]
 30:  487| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  490| [45] ["It appears that there was someone who came before me who also learned of that secret, but he was killed."]
 32:  516| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  519| [45] ["LABO thinks nothing of the lives of us Junior Fellows."]
 34:  545| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  548| [45] ["So I figured I had to do something before I was next."]
 36:  556| [47] [Watase]
 37:  559| [45] ["So you're doing this to protect yourself... huh."]
 38:  585| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  588| [45] ["I know it's much more pathetic than your reason-- but is it acceptable to you?"]
 40:  593| [47] [Watase]
 41:  594| [45] ["..."]
 42:  602| [47] [Watase]
 43:  605| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 44:  610| [45] [Watase didn't think Ukita's reason was pathetic at all.]
 45:  615| [45] [It was only natural to want to save yourself when your own life was at risk.]
 46:  620| [47] [Watase]
 47:  621| [45] [(No one can blame him...)]
 48:  656| [45] [Watase held his hand out to Ukita.]
 49:  683| [47] [Watase]
 50:  686| [45] ["I'll trust you. I'll help you out as much as I'm needed to."]
 51:  694| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  697| [45] ["... I am grateful beyond words to hear that."]
 53:  702| [45] [Ukita then gave Watase a firm handshake.]
 54:  707| [45] [His hand was as thin as a dead tree, but his palm was filled with heat.]
 55:  757| [45] [--From that day onwards, Watase and Ukita began making preparations to put their terrorist plot into action.]
 56:  884| [45] [They held their secret meetings to formulate said plot in Watase's apartment.]
 57:  889| [45] [Before the meeting, Watase followed Ukita's instructions and checked the apartment to make sure it wasn't bugged anywhere.]
 58:  894| [45] [He was horrified to discover that there were indeed several bugs in his apartment, but he destroyed all of them.]
 59:  899| [45] [He was a bit cautious after that, but no new bugs were planted.]
 60:  904| [45] [It appeared he had probably long since ceased to be an observation target for Rokumei City.]
 61:  940| [47] [Watase]
 62:  943| [45] ["--Okay then, I need to know everything, Mr. Ukita."]
 63:  951| [47] [Watase]
 64:  954| [45] ["Tell me all the details about the plan and its goal."]
 65: 1010| [47] [Ukita]
 66: 1013| [45] ["Very well. This is what we've thought up so far."]
 67: 1018| [45] [A faint floral scent filled the air when Ukita said that.]
 68: 1044| [47] [Ukita]
 69: 1047| [45] ["First of all, our ultimate objective is to abduct the test subjects."]
 70: 1055| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1058| [45] ["Huh? What good's abducting monsters gonna do?"]
 72: 1084| [47] [Ukita]
 73: 1087| [45] ["I believe I've already told you this, but a Communicator who's turned into a monster has the potential to become a biological weapon."]
 74: 1095| [47] [Ukita]
 75: 1098| [45] ["LABO's barbarity would come to an end were the world to ever learn of the danger they possess."]
 76: 1106| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1109| [45] ["I see, that makes sense. That would probably result in an investigation into all the other things Rokumei City's been covering up all this time one after another."]
 78: 1135| [47] [Ukita]
 79: 1138| [45] ["Indeed. It would also deal a major blow to both LABO and Rokumei City."]
 80: 1176| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1179| [45] ["But even so, how are we supposed to break into LABO to do that?"]
 82: 1187| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1190| [45] ["LABO has strict security on par with that of a nuclear power plant, right?"]
 84: 1216| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1219| [45] ["Indeed. That's where you and your rescue squad come in."]
 86: 1227| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1230| [45] ["What?"]
 88: 1256| [47] [Ukita]
 89: 1259| [45] ["LABO's security has but one hole in it."]
 90: 1285| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1288| [45] ["It's the automatic 'disaster prevention system'-- their biggest blind spot."]
 92: 1296| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1299| [45] ["So you're planning to exploit the disaster prevention system...?"]
 94: 1307| [47] [Ukita]
 95: 1310| [45] ["Yes. When a fire breaks out in LABO, they automatically send a report to you guys at 'Sirius', right?"]
 96: 1336| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1339| [45] ["That should allow you guys to break into LABO without being stopped by security."]
 98: 1347| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1350| [45] ["...!"]
100: 1358| [47] [Watase]
101: 1361| [45] ["I get it... so you're saying we should take advantage of the chaos following the fire to get those test subjects out!"]
102: 1366| [45] [Now he finally understood why Ukita had recruited him.]
103: 1392| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1395| [45] ["But this is just your way in."]
105: 1421| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1424| [45] ["LABO's security system has layer upon layer of protection that will provide several obstacles towards the plan's execution."]
107: 1450| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1453| [45] ["I'll explain them one by one."]
109: 1458| [45] [Ukita took out his PDA.]
110: 1509| [45] [A map was on its screen.]
111: 1517| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1520| [45] ["This is a map of LABO. Q's comrades were able to steal this map from the contractors who built the facility."]
113: 1528| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1531| [45] ["Anyway, take a look at this. The test subjects are being held captive in the deepest depths beneath LABO."]
115: 1539| [47] [Watase]
116: 1542| [45] ["You mean in floor B2?"]
117: 1547| [45] [He'd heard that LABO had two surface floors and two basement floors.]
118: 1552| [45] [So he assumed that they'd be on the lowest floor--]
119: 1560| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1563| [45] ["No. Deeper than that."]
121: 1610| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1613| [45] ["In the center of the basement floors is 'Area N'... but the truth is, there's an elevator there that goes down."]
123: 1621| [47] [Watase]
124: 1624| [45] ["What!? So there's a B3!?"]
125: 1672| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1675| [45] ["Precisely. It's a large basement floor located deep underground known as 'Area Zero'--"]
127: 1683| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1686| [45] ["That's where the two test subjects are being held. A place where no sunlight ever reaches."]
129: 1694| [47] [Watase]
130: 1697| [45] ["So we've got two test subjects, huh... Do we know their names, ages, and genders?"]
131: 1705| [47] [Ukita]
132: 1708| [45] ["No. All I was able to discover is that they're called 'Subject N' and "Subject Y-II'."]
133: 1716| [47] [Watase]
134: 1719| [45] ["Y-II? So there's a Y-I?"]
135: 1755| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1758| [45] ["No... they say 'Subject Y' was 'discarded' several years ago."]
137: 1766| [47] [Ukita]
138: 1769| [45] ["They most likely died in LABO, just like 'Subject A'."]
139: 1777| [47] [Watase]
140: 1780| [45] ["... I see."]
141: 1804| [45] [Natsuhiko was shocked to hear what they were saying.]
142: 1809| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1810| [45] [(There's a third basement floor known as Area Zero!?)]
144: 1815| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 1816| [45] [(... So that means there's another floor under LABO!)]
146: 1868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1869| [45] [(Right under where I was lying for all those hours...)]
148: 2013| [45] [According to what he'd heard, the ones imprisoned down there were "Subject N" and "Subject Y-II".]
149: 2018| [45] [He didn't know which one referred to Yuuri and which one referred to the other girl...]
150: 2116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 2117| [45] [(But that means what Yuuri said was true...)]
152: 2122| [45] [There had also been a "Subject Y", but they'd already died, apparently.]
153: 2127| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2128| [45] [(Did they also die from "human experimentation"...?)]
155: 2159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2160| [45] [(But nothing like that ever happened to Yuuri.)]
157: 2165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2166| [45] [(Wait, hold on... could that mean that the test subjects were each treated differently?)]
159: 2205| [45] [There was still too much Natsuhiko didn't know.]
160: 2301| [45] [Watase kept silent, and Ukita continued.]
161: 2309| [47] [Ukita]
162: 2312| [45] ["... Let's get back on topic. So the test subjects we need to save are in Area Zero--"]
163: 2359| [47] [Ukita]
164: 2362| [45] ["However, in order to get down there, you'll need two security cards from top brass researchers."]
165: 2409| [47] [Ukita]
166: 2412| [45] ["What's more, there's apparently a retinal scan ID process involved."]
167: 2420| [47] [Watase]
168: 2423| [45] ["They sure didn't pull their punches when it came to security on the thing..."]
169: 2470| [47] [Ukita]
170: 2473| [45] ["Indeed. To make matters worse, even if you can get the test subjects out of Area Zero, there's another problem. As soon as you get out of Area N..."]
171: 2569| [47] [Ukita]
172: 2572| [45] ["A 'Case N'-- the code to prevent a test subject from escaping-- will be declared."]
173: 2580| [47] [Watase]
174: 2583| [45] ["A Case N?"]
175: 2630| [47] [Ukita]
176: 2633| [45] ["A code that locks down the countless security gates in the facility."]
177: 2641| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2644| [45] ["What's more, it causes indestructible bulkheads to block all routes to the surface, preventing anyone from getting out."]
179: 2652| [47] [Ukita]
180: 2655| [45] ["Furthermore, the security team and staff will realize something's gone horribly wrong when a Case N is announced."]
181: 2663| [47] [Ukita]
182: 2666| [45] ["Any staff still inside the facility will become desperate to find the escaped test subjects... while the security teams outside the facility will form a perimeter around the facility to prevent them from getting away."]
183: 2728| [47] [Watase]
184: 2731| [45] ["That does sound like quite the challenge... Then is there any way to prevent a Case N from being declared?"]
185: 2757| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2760| [45] ["No."]
187: 2768| [47] [Ukita]
188: 2771| [45] ["The Case N declaration system is conducted by the supercomputer 'Brain Cell', which supervises all of LABO."]
189: 2779| [47] [Ukita]
190: 2782| [45] ["It has three control systems that mutually complement each other. It's impossible to knock them all offline at the same time."]
191: 2790| [47] [Watase]
192: 2793| [45] ["... Talk about thorough."]
193: 2819| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2822| [45] ["Yes. Though apparently you can take the test subjects all the way to Area 5 if you go through standard procedures..."]
195: 2830| [47] [Watase]
196: 2833| [45] ["Area 5? Why's that the one place it's okay to take them to?"]
197: 2841| [47] [Ukita]
198: 2844| [45] ["There are rooms in that area where they conduct examinations and experiments on the test subjects."]
199: 2852| [47] [Ukita]
200: 2855| [45] ["Therefore, it's the only place where the test subjects are allowed to be taken to--"]
201: 2881| [47] [Ukita]
202: 2884| [45] ["But even in the case they are taken to Area 5, it appears a Case N is still declared if they ever approach the elevators and emergency staircases."]
203: 2892| [47] [Watase]
204: 2895| [45] ["So what you're saying is that it's impossible to leave the facility with the test subjects even if we manage to get in there...?"]
205: 2921| [47] [Ukita]
206: 2924| [45] ["Yes. But we must do it regardless. We have to make the impossible possible."]
207: 2929| [45] [Watase nodded.]
208: 2934| [45] [There were three major problems with the plan.]
209: 2939| [45] [The first one was finding a way to get past the security card and retinal scan checks to get down to Area Zero.]
210: 2944| [45] [The second one was finding a way to get the test subjects out of there without being discovered by the staff still in the facility.]
211: 2949| [45] [The third and final one was finding a way to escape the facility with the test subjects even after a Case N had been declared.]
212: 2975| [47] [Ukita]
213: 2978| [45] ["Let's cover the first problem first: how to get down to Area Zero..."]
214: 3004| [47] [Ukita]
215: 3007| [45] ["We'll probably have to render some high ranked researchers unconscious on the day we execute our plan, then take them with us and force them to do the retinal scan."]
216: 3033| [47] [Ukita]
217: 3036| [45] ["That's also how we'll get the cards. That way, we can get down to Area Zero by making it look like we're going through standard procedures."]
218: 3044| [47] [Watase]
219: 3047| [45] ["I don't like the idea of doing that... but we have no choice, huh."]
220: 3052| [45] [Watase accepted Ukita's proposal.]
221: 3078| [47] [Ukita]
222: 3081| [45] ["Let's move on to the next issue then. As for how we can deal with the staff in the facility--"]
223: 3089| [47] [Ukita]
224: 3092| [45] ["We've decided to use the Case N declaration against them."]
225: 3100| [47] [Watase]
226: 3103| [45] ["...? What do you mean?"]
227: 3129| [47] [Ukita]
228: 3132| [45] ["It's a little complicated, but hear me out. It'll go something like this:"]
229: 3137| [45] [And with that lead in, Ukita began explaining.]
230: 3163| [47] [Ukita]
231: 3166| [45] ["First things first, LABO has this machine in it called a WX particle amplifier. It will go haywire if handled incorrectly."]
232: 3174| [47] [Ukita]
233: 3177| [45] ["'Brain Cell' will automatically take action to stop the machine once it goes haywire--"]
234: 3203| [47] [Ukita]
235: 3206| [45] ["But it will take time for it to stop it. If we intentionally cause it to go haywire, that process will take 12 hours."]
236: 3214| [47] [Ukita]
237: 3217| [45] ["And if a Case N is declared at the same time the WX particle amplifier is going haywire..."]
238: 3225| [47] [Ukita]
239: 3228| [45] ["... then it will be impossible to call off the Case N until the machine has stopped going haywire.%NIt will be absolutely impossible for them to open up the sealed bulkheads."]
240: 3236| [47] [Watase]
241: 3239| [45] ["What? Why won't they be able to open up the bulkheads?"]
242: 3265| [47] [Ukita]
243: 3268| [45] ["The WX amplifier is basically a machine that spreads elementary particles that amplify the effects of BC."]
244: 3294| [47] [Ukita]
245: 3297| [45] ["Can you imagine what would happen if a test subject escaped while that machine was going haywire?"]
246: 3323| [47] [Ukita]
247: 3326| [45] ["It's likely they'd use BC to seek help from people outside. In the worst case scenario, the townspeople could end up receiving the test subject's telepathy."]
248: 3334| [47] [Watase]
249: 3337| [45] ["I see... now I understand why they won't be able to open the bulkheads. It's just yet another part of their whole cover-up."]
250: 3345| [47] [Watase]
251: 3348| [45] ["But what does that have to do with how security teams will try to deal with it?"]
252: 3374| [47] [Ukita]
253: 3377| [45] ["Right. I was about to use that as the basis to explain what we should do."]
254: 3385| [47] [Ukita]
255: 3388| [45] ["First, we'll start a fire in the facility and force the staff and security teams to evacuate. We won't rescue the test subjects just yet at that point."]
256: 3396| [47] [Ukita]
257: 3399| [45] ["But if the WX particle amplifier goes haywire and a Case N is declared after they've all evacuated--"]
258: 3425| [47] [Ukita]
259: 3428| [45] ["Then there'll be no one left in the facility."]
260: 3436| [47] [Watase]
261: 3439| [45] ["Everything sounded like a good idea up until that point. But won't that mean we won't be able to get outside?"]
262: 3465| [47] [Ukita]
263: 3468| [45] ["Incorrect. There is still a single place we can escape from even with the bulkheads locked down."]
264: 3476| [47] [Watase]
265: 3479| [45] ["What!? Where's that!?"]
266: 3505| [47] [Ukita]
267: 3508| [45] ["The WX particle amplifier's coolant pipes."]
268: 3519| [45] [Ukita fiddled around with his PDA again after he said that.]
269: 3566| [45] [When he did, the screen changed to show the WX particle amplifier's manual.]
270: 3638| [47] [Ukita]
271: 3641| [45] ["The water used for the WX particle amplifier's coolant is drawn in from Lake Rokumei."]
272: 3649| [47] [Ukita]
273: 3652| [45] ["The coolant's intake and drainage pipes are 1 m in diameter. Just big enough for a person to fit in."]
274: 3660| [47] [Ukita]
275: 3663| [45] ["The pipes are filled with hot water that circulates at high speeds--"]
276: 3680| [47] [Ukita]
277: 3683| [45] ["But the whole thing's set up so that the water automatically stops flowing if you destroy the coolant's 'filtering mechanism'."]
278: 3691| [47] [Watase]
279: 3694| [45] ["Wait, hold on. Won't opening a hole in the intake pipe flood all of LABO?"]
280: 3699| [45] [Watase pointed to a part of the diagram and spoke.]
281: 3716| [47] [Watase]
282: 3719| [45] ["According to this diagram, the 'intake pipe' is located under Lake Rokumei's water level."]
283: 3727| [47] [Watase]
284: 3730| [45] ["Meaning water will pour out of the pipe all at once if you open a hole in it, running water or not... and LABO will be flooded."]
285: 3747| [47] [Ukita]
286: 3750| [45] ["Right, which is why we'll open a hole in the drainage pipe."]
287: 3767| [47] [Ukita]
288: 3770| [45] ["There's a giant pump inside the drainage pipe. That will prevent us from passing through--"]
289: 3797| [47] [Ukita]
290: 3800| [45] ["So I want you to destroy it."]
291: 3805| [45] [Ukita said that with a broad grin on his face.]
292: 3813| [47] [Watase]
293: 3816| [45] ["Did you say... destroy it? How?"]
294: 3842| [47] [Ukita]
295: 3845| [45] ["If you destroy the pump first, then your main obstacle will be the water in the pipe."]
296: 3853| [47] [Ukita]
297: 3856| [45] ["But if we stop the water from running and open up a hole on the bottom half of the pipe--"]
298: 3864| [47] [Watase]
299: 3867| [45] ["... Oh, I get it! Then we can drain the water!"]
300: 3875| [47] [Ukita]
301: 3878| [45] ["Glad you get it."]
302: 3896| [45] [The drainage pipe's exit was above Lake Rokumei's water level.]
303: 3901| [45] [Meaning that unlike the intake pipe, opening a hole in there would cause much less water to pour out.]
304: 3909| [47] [Ukita]
305: 3912| [45] ["So our next issue is how to destroy the pump after we've drained the water, but--"]
306: 3939| [47] [Ukita]
307: 3942| [45] ["This is where I'd appreciate some ideas from you."]
308: 3950| [47] [Ukita]
309: 3953| [45] ["Can you think of any specialized rescue equipment that can be used to destroy the pump?"]
310: 3961| [47] [Watase]
311: 3964| [45] ["Let's see... special equipment to destroy a pump, huh..."]
312: 3969| [45] [Watase thought the whole thing through, then quickly found an answer.]
313: 3977| [47] [Watase]
314: 3980| [45] ["... I know. A jackhammer should probably do the trick."]
315: 4006| [47] [Ukita]
316: 4009| [45] ["A jackhammer?"]
317: 4017| [47] [Watase]
318: 4020| [45] ["You know, the tool used to smash down bedrock. We use it to rescue those who are trapped behind fallen debris."]
319: 4028| [47] [Watase]
320: 4031| [45] ["So it shouldn't look all that suspicious if we use the fire as a pretext to bring one down to the basement."]
321: 4057| [47] [Ukita]
322: 4060| [45] ["Indeed, that sounds like it would work nicely...! But how much time do you think it'd take for one of those things to destroy the pump?"]
323: 4068| [47] [Watase]
324: 4071| [45] ["Well, if we kept working without a break... I'd say about 3 hours or so."]
325: 4079| [47] [Watase]
326: 4082| [45] ["But you said that the bulkheads will remained closed for about 12 hours if a Case N is declared, right?"]
327: 4090| [47] [Watase]
328: 4093| [45] ["So it might take a little time, but it shouldn't be a problem."]
329: 4119| [47] [Ukita]
330: 4122| [45] ["...!"]
331: 4130| [47] [Watase]
332: 4133| [45] ["After we force the facility into lockdown, we'll take our time destroying the pump... and then we can escape to Lake Rokumei with the test subjects."]
333: 4141| [47] [Watase]
334: 4144| [45] ["Those dumbasses at LABO will just be waiting outside the facility the whole time for the lockdown to be lifted. And when the bulkheads finally open..."]
335: 4152| [47] [Watase]
336: 4155| [45] ["... they'll find nothing more than an empty husk."]
337: 4182| [47] [Ukita]
338: 4185| [45] ["Incredible! It's the perfect plan!"]
339: 4190| [45] [Ukita broke out into a reassured smile.]
340: 4195| [45] [Satisfied, Watase returned Ukita's smile with one of his own.]
341: 4203| [47] [Watase]
342: 4206| [45] ["All right, then let's go with this plan! Things are about to get busy!"]
343: 4232| [47] [Ukita]
344: 4235| [45] ["Yes! There's a lot of things we'll need to prepare in order to execute our plan!"]
345: 4243| [47] [Watase]
346: 4246| [45] ["It's about time we got to thinking about the starting point though: how do we cause the fire in the facility?"]
347: 4254| [47] [Ukita]
348: 4257| [45] ["Leave that to me. I'll contact other Q members and get incendiary bombs and the other necessary equipment from them."]
349: 4265| [47] [Watase]
350: 4268| [45] ["Thanks, you're a lifesaver."]
351: 4273| [45] [And so Watase and Ukita began formulating their plan on a grand scale.]
352: 4326| [45] [--Ukita contacted other Q members and gave them the outline of the plan.]
353: 4331| [45] [Q gave their answer on the spot.]
354: 4336| [45] ["It's a good plan. We approve of it as well. We'll back you up in every way we can".]
355: 4341| [45] [Once they got that answer, Watase and Ukita collaborated with the other Q members located in Rokumei City to move forward with the plan.]
356: 4346| [45] [First, they got their answer on how to cause the fire.]
357: 4351| [45] ["We will prepare 100 incendiary time bombs. Set those up in LABO and make them go off all at the same time."]
358: 4424| [47] [Watase]
359: 4427| [45] ["I'm grateful for that. The problem is how to set the bombs in the first place..."]
360: 4453| [47] [Ukita]
361: 4456| [45] ["That will indeed be difficult. Someone will spot the bombs shortly after they're planted and cause a big fuss."]
362: 4464| [47] [Watase]
363: 4467| [45] ["Then can't we hide the bombs in something to disguise them? That way they won't suspect they're bombs when they see them."]
364: 4475| [47] [Watase]
365: 4478| [45] ["Like, for example... by putting them in fire extinguishers."]
366: 4504| [47] [Ukita]
367: 4507| [45] ["Fire extinguishers?"]
368: 4561| [47] [Watase]
369: 4564| [45] ["Our squad directs LABO's disaster prevention."]
370: 4572| [47] [Watase]
371: 4575| [45] ["We replace their old fire extinguishers with new ones once every two years as part of that program. That's our chance."]
372: 4583| [47] [Watase]
373: 4586| [45] ["If we use that opportunity to switch the fire extinguishers out with ones filled with the bombs--"]
374: 4594| [47] [Ukita]
375: 4597| [45] ["I see! Then we could set bombs up all over LABO in no time!"]
376: 4630| [47] [Ukita]
377: 4633| [45] ["And no one ever looks at what's inside a fire extinguisher, so we won't have to worry about anyone finding them! It's the perfect camouflage!"]
378: 4641| [47] [Watase]
379: 4644| [45] ["All right, then we'll go with that."]
380: 4652| [47] [Watase]
381: 4655| [45] ["We're scheduled to replace the fire extinguishers in September of next year. After that, LABO will be filled with bombs disguised as fire extinguishers."]
382: 4708| [45] [--They also received various orders from Q.]
383: 4713| [45] ["As for us, we would like you to physically destroy LABO. It is a symbol of Rokumei City's wrongdoings."]
384: 4718| [45] ["By destroying it, we can let the world know of our resentment".]
385: 4723| [45] ["We have prepared a powerful time bomb that will blow LABO sky high. Plant it inside the facility".]
386: 4796| [47] [Watase]
387: 4799| [45] ["Mmm, it's easy enough to set up that time bomb... but I'd rather we do it in a way to prevent casualties."]
388: 4825| [47] [Ukita]
389: 4828| [45] ["But destroying LABO has a huge benefit to us."]
390: 4854| [47] [Ukita]
391: 4857| [45] ["If we cause an explosion powerful enough to blow up the entire facility, then won't LABO's staff waiting outside believe that both we and the test subjects died in it?"]
392: 4865| [47] [Watase]
393: 4868| [45] ["I see, so that way, we'll pull the wool right over our pursuers' eyes... but there's one major problem with that."]
394: 4876| [47] [Watase]
395: 4879| [45] ["If I've got this right, in order to get down to Area Zero, we have to knock out two high ranked researchers and take them down with us for authentication, correct?"]
396: 4887| [47] [Watase]
397: 4890| [45] ["But that means they'll be stuck in the facility after the Case N is declared. Then they'll get caught up in the explosion."]
398: 4916| [47] [Ukita]
399: 4919| [45] ["That's true..."]
400: 4927| [47] [Watase]
401: 4930| [45] ["On the other hand, I think it's far too risky to take them with us when we escape, so I'd rather not. It's a rather tight escape plan."]
402: 4956| [47] [Ukita]
403: 4959| [45] ["... All right, then how about this?"]
404: 4985| [47] [Ukita]
405: 4988| [45] ["We'll set the time bomb so that it goes off one minute after the lockdown lifts."]
406: 4996| [47] [Ukita]
407: 4999| [45] ["That should give both of them just enough time to escape."]
408: 5007| [47] [Watase]
409: 5010| [45] ["Is there a way we can figure out the time the lockdown will be lifted in advance?"]
410: 5036| [47] [Ukita]
411: 5039| [45] ["Brain Cell's monitor will show the expected time for when the lockdown is to be lifted."]
412: 5047| [47] [Ukita]
413: 5050| [45] ["We'll check that, then set the bomb's timer for one minute after that."]
414: 5076| [47] [Ukita]
415: 5079| [45] ["... Though to be honest, it's a rather desperate measure."]
416: 5087| [47] [Watase]
417: 5090| [45] ["Can't do anything about that. I mean, we're trying to carry out a terrorist plot without killing anyone. It sounds nigh-impossible."]
418: 5116| [47] [Ukita]
419: 5119| [45] ["But aren't we being naive... for coming up with that idea?"]
420: 5127| [47] [Watase]
421: 5130| [45] ["No, it's the right thing to do. We'll be lower than shit if we kill anyone-- no better than the guys at LABO."]
422: 5156| [47] [Ukita]
423: 5159| [45] ["... Yes, you're right!"]
424: 5183| [45] [--Natsuhiko shuddered when he heard their conversation.]
425: 5188| [47] [Natsuhiko]
426: 5189| [45] [(Did they just say that there's a powerful time bomb that can blow LABO sky high!?)]
427: 5194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
428: 5195| [45] [(And that they planted that thing in LABO!?)]
429: 5250| [45] [But it was set to go off one minute after the lockdown ended.]
430: 5255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
431: 5256| [45] [(Watase, Mr. Ukita, what have you done...!?)]
432: 5273| [45] [But on the other hand, there was something else that was really bugging him.]
433: 5278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 5279| [45] [(But... something's weird. Watase said he wanted to avoid casualties...)]
435: 5284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
436: 5285| [45] [(Like Mr. Ukita said, that's a rather naive idea for a terrorist...)]
437: 5290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
438: 5291| [45] [(Was he thinking that though Communicators were "monsters", he didn't want to kill any "humans" if possible?)]
439: 5296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
440: 5297| [45] [(Are Communicators and humans totally different species in Watase's mind...?)]
441: 5302| [45] [It was indeed somewhat strange, but Natsuhiko continued to read through Watase's memories.]
442: 5406| [45] [--And thus their plan approached its final stages.]
443: 5411| [45] [It was then that Q sent their third set of orders--]
444: 5416| [45] ["We're uneasy about only two people carrying out the plan. We would prefer it if you could get about two more people for the job".]
445: 5421| [45] ["We would like you to invite Mr. Seiji Dojima and Mr. Kazuki Hiyama, Comrade Kasasagi's coworkers, to become our comrades".]
446: 5426| [45] [Watase understood what they were getting at.]
447: 5431| [45] [But though he was okay with just himself being a part of it, was it really okay for him to get his coworkers wrapped up in this terrorist plot?]
448: 5436| [47] [Watase]
449: 5437| [45] [(... Those guys have the same background as me. Dojima lost his girlfriend in the Great Arson while Hiyama lost his younger brother.)]
450: 5442| [47] [Watase]
451: 5443| [45] [(So if they learn the truth, they too should hate Rokumei City's barbarism enough to want revenge... just like me...!)]
452: 5496| [45] [--So while he was reluctant at first, Watase eventually contacted Dojima and Hiyama.]
453: 5568| [47] [Ukita]
454: 5571| [45] ["... So, how'd your coworkers react to the news?"]
455: 5579| [47] [Watase]
456: 5582| [45] ["The exact same way I did... They shook with anger and agreed to join Q."]
457: 5608| [47] [Ukita]
458: 5611| [45] ["I see... then that means all the necessary pieces are now in place."]
459: 5616| [45] [And thus Watase and Ukita's plan was now complete.]
460: 5621| [45] [They'd plant incendiary bombs in fire extinguishers and artificially start a fire.]
461: 5626| [45] [Next, they'd cause the WX particle amplifier to go haywire, rescue the test subjects, and cause a Case N to be declared.]
462: 5631| [45] [Once the lockdown began, they'd set the time bomb in the facility, then escape through the coolant's drainage pipe.]
463: 5636| [45] [Then once the bomb went off, all traces of Watase and Ukita's crimes-- as well as any way of finding out if the test subjects were dead or alive-- would go up in flames.]
464: 5644| [47] [Watase]
465: 5647| [45] ["... So all that's left is to actually do this, huh."]
466: 5673| [47] [Ukita]
467: 5676| [45] ["Indeed."]
468: 5681| [45] [Ukita took out his PDA.]
469: 5707| [47] [Ukita]
470: 5710| [45] ["Q has sent us one last order to this PDA. I'll read it for us."]
471: 5718| [47] [Watase]
472: 5721| [45] ["What's it say?"]
473: 5747| [47] [Ukita]
474: 5750| [45] ["--We are grateful for all your efforts, Comrades Kasasagi and Ukita."]
475: 5758| [47] [Ukita]
476: 5761| [45] ["We will now commence preparing the bombs and weapons necessary to carry out this plan."]
477: 5770| [47] [Ukita]
478: 5773| [45] ["These include 100 incendiary bombs disguised as fire extinguishers, a 3 kg 'tetryl' explosive that will be used to destroy LABO, and three 'NZ-75' pistols for self-defense."]
479: 5781| [47] [Ukita]
480: 5784| [45] ["The tetryl and pistols will be mixed in with the rescue squad's special equipment and delivered on D-day."]
481: 5792| [47] [Ukita]
482: 5795| [45] ["Your target is the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization. Your objectives are to destroy the facility and abduct the two test subjects."]
483: 5803| [47] [Ukita]
484: 5806| [45] ["The plan will be carried out approximately one year from now-- on September 16, 2030."]
485: 5814| [47] [Watase]
486: 5817| [45] ["... The anniversary of the Great Rokumei City Arson, huh."]
487: 5822| [45] [That day probably held unpleasant memories for Q's members, whoever they were.]
488: 5827| [45] [It was clearly no coincidence that they picked that day of all days to commence their plan.]
489: 5835| [47] [Ukita]
490: 5838| [45] ["--Until that day, each comrade is to make further preparations."]
491: 5847| [47] [Ukita]
492: 5850| [45] ["There are countless things you must do in advance, such as hand-to-hand and firearms combat training."]
493: 5858| [47] [Ukita]
494: 5861| [45] ["Naturally, you mustn't tell anyone else about the plan over the course of the next year, to say the least of opening your heart to anyone."]
495: 5869| [47] [Ukita]
496: 5872| [45] ["Rokumei City is full of countless Communicators. If you open your heart to someone, they might read your mind and find out all about the plan."]
497: 5880| [47] [Ukita]
498: 5883| [45] ["All Communicators are not like us-- they're monsters with strange powers. The now deceased Subject A wasn't the exception. She was the standard."]
499: 5891| [47] [Ukita]
500: 5894| [45] ["Think of all Communicators as abominations. Think of Rokumei City as a city full of monsters."]
501: 5902| [47] [Ukita]
502: 5905| [45] ["We must put an end to this abnormal town's history."]
503: 5913| [47] [Ukita]
504: 5916| [45] ["You may find that to be a rather extreme mindset, but unless you take precise caution, our flawless plan will come crashing down."]
505: 5924| [47] [Ukita]
506: 5927| [45] ["Bear all of that in mind as you wait for the day of reckoning."]
507: 5935| [47] [Ukita]
508: 5938| [45] ["The day where the truth shall be brought to light and 118 lost souls shall at last rest in peace--"]
509: 5943| [45] [Once Ukita had finished reading the long piece of text, he shot Watase a pointed gaze.]
510: 5969| [47] [Ukita]
511: 5972| [45] ["... That's a rare view to voice these days, wouldn't you agree?"]
512: 5980| [47] [Watase]
513: 5983| [45] ["Communicators are abominations, huh..."]
514: 6009| [47] [Ukita]
515: 6012| [45] ["Perhaps that's going too far, but it is indeed true that we cannot open our hearts to anyone."]
516: 6038| [47] [Watase]
517: 6041| [45] ["... Yeah, you said it."]
518: 6102| [45] [And so Watase and his comrades began their long year of preparation.]
519: 6107| [45] [All the way until September 2030--]
