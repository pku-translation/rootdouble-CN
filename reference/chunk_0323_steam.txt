  0:   60| [45] [And then Natsuhiko finally arrived...]
  1:   65| [45] [... at the memory right before Ukita had been infected with Subject N's malice.]
  2:   94| [47] [Yuuri]
  3:   97| [45] [{Be careful, Hikorin. I'm sure N's just up ahead...}]
  4:  105| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  108| [45] ["Yeah, I got it. I'll be careful this time to make sure she doesn't corrode me like she did back when I encountered her in Watase's memory."]
  6:  146| [45] [Natsuhiko pulled himself together and looked into Ukita's memories.]
  7:  218| [45] [--This one began where Ukita saw Subject N's dead body.]
  8:  223| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  224| [45] [(I knew it... this is where Mr. Ukita was infected with malice.)]
 10:  231| [45] [But something felt off.]
 11:  236| [45] [... It was too quiet.]
 12:  299| [45] [Confused, Natsuhiko looked around, only to find that Ukita was the only one there.]
 13:  304| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  305| [45] [(Huh!? But weren't the others with him at the time!?)]
 15:  310| [45] [No, that wasn't all that was odd.]
 16:  315| [45] [Natsuhiko had "looked around" of his own accord. Which meant--]
 17:  320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  321| [45] [(This isn't Mr. Ukita's memory!)]
 19:  326| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  327| [45] [(It's just like with Watase--!)]
 21:  332| [45] [A voice then filled the air.]
 22:  340| [47] [???]
 23:  343| [45] ["It would appear that you have realized that this is no ordinary memory, no?"]
 24:  429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  432| [45] ["!?"]
 26:  437| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped and watched in surprise as Subject N's body slowly stood up.]
 27:  509| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  512| [45] ["Subject N...!"]
 29:  520| [47] [Subject N]
 30:  523| [45] ["No, that is incorrect. I am not Subject N."]
 31:  531| [47] [Subject N]
 32:  534| [45] ["On the other hand, nor am I Keiji Ukita proper."]
 33:  539| [45] [She was talking much differently that the "spirit" of Subject N that Natsuhiko had encountered in Watase's head.]
 34:  544| [45] [Much like how that spirit's speech and personality had been strongly influenced by Watase,%Nthis one had most likely been influenced by Ukita.]
 35:  549| [45] [Thinking to himself, Natsuhiko responded to her.]
 36:  557| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  560| [45] ["So if you're not Subject N or Mr. Ukita-- then who are you?"]
 38:  636| [47] [Subject N]
 39:  639| [45] ["Hmph, looks like the apple fell far from the tree. Then allow me to enlighten you on my viewpoint."]
 40:  665| [47] [Subject N]
 41:  668| [45] ["Would you happen to know what a 'null value' is?"]
 42:  676| [47] [Subject N]
 43:  679| [45] ["It's an expression used in programming languages and database entry. It refers to a state where no data has been input, or an empty character string with a length of zero."]
 44:  687| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  690| [45] ["...?"]
 46:  716| [47] [Subject N]
 47:  719| [45] ["You don't understand? Then allow me to put it in layman's terms."]
 48:  745| [47] [Subject N]
 49:  748| [45] ["Null values are something like '""' that exist within a program."]
 50:  756| [47] [Subject N]
 51:  759| [45] ["These '""' possess no information in the world of information. But those null values do certainly exist."]
 52:  767| [47] [Subject N]
 53:  770| [45] ["I'm much like those null values."]
 54:  778| [47] [Subject N]
 55:  781| [45] ["I am 'nowhere', but I do indeed exist inside Ukita's brain."]
 56:  789| [47] [Subject N]
 57:  792| [45] ["But I'm a meaningless entity who only exists there."]
 58:  797| [45] [It appeared Subject N was trying to say that there was no need to erase her because she was meaningless.]
 59:  802| [45] [But Natsuhiko wasn't fooled by her words.]
 60:  810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  813| [45] ["Don't lie, Subject N!"]
 62:  821| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  824| [45] ["If you're a meaningless entity, then why did Ukita's personality change!?"]
 64:  850| [47] [Subject N]
 65:  853| [45] ["Oh, so you say his personality changed? Would you be talking about -this- Ukita, then?"]
 66:  858| [45] [The scene in front of them changed the moment Subject N said that.]
 67: 1009| [45] [--It was the memory of when Ukita had pointed a gun to Watase.]
 68: 1017| [47] [Ukita]
 69: 1020| [45] ["... Go ahead and laugh. I know it's fragile justice. But it's my choice."]
 70: 1028| [47] [Ukita]
 71: 1031| [45] ["If killing you means it'll put an end to all of this, then I'll do what I must."]
 72: 1072| [47] [Ukita]
 73: 1075| [45] ["Even if it means staining my hands in sin for the first and last time in my life...!"]
 74: 1080| [47] [Ukita]
 75: 1081| [45] [(If I don't, Captain Kasasagi will kill both Subject Y-II and Natsuhiko...!)]
 76: 1220| [47] [Subject N]
 77: 1223| [45] ["--Now then, allow me to ask you a question regarding that memory."]
 78: 1231| [47] [Subject N]
 79: 1234| [45] ["Did Ukita's personality really change?"]
 80: 1260| [47] [Subject N]
 81: 1263| [45] ["I just want to keep you and Subject Y-II safe from Captain Kasasagi through whatever means necessary."]
 82: 1271| [47] [Subject N]
 83: 1274| [45] ["Are those not Keiji Ukita's actual feelings?"]
 84: 1279| [45] [Subject N's words did indeed nearly sound true.]
 85: 1284| [45] [But Natsuhiko denied them.]
 86: 1292| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1295| [45] ["... No. Despite all that, Mr. Ukita never wanted to kill anyone. Never."]
 88: 1303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1306| [45] ["You're not some meaningless '""' either. You're 'malice' incarnate."]
 90: 1314| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1317| [45] ["You really are Subject N. Plain and simple."]
 92: 1343| [47] [Subject N]
 93: 1346| [45] ["Hahah, I see... Then what will you do? Erase me?"]
 94: 1354| [47] [Subject N]
 95: 1357| [45] ["For I am not Ukita, but rather a different being known as Subject N?"]
 96: 1365| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1368| [45] ["Yeah... because Mr. Ukita will never go back to normal if I don't..."]
 98: 1394| [47] [Subject N]
 99: 1397| [45] ["I see... So you'll erase me knowing that I'm not a meaningless entity..."]
100: 1423| [47] [Subject N]
101: 1426| [45] ["Well, whatever... if you're so sure of your own sense of justice, then do it."]
102: 1434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1437| [45] ["No... maybe I'm the one who's wrong."]
104: 1445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1448| [45] ["But I'm sorry... I'm going to erase you, Subject N..."]
106: 1453| [45] [Whether Subject N was a meaningless existence or not was a question not even Natsuhiko had an answer for.]
107: 1458| [45] [But regardless, he had to bring Ukita back to normal. So in order to do that--]
108: 1545| [45] [--He erased Subject N.]
