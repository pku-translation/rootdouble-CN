  1:   60| [45] [Ukita weaved his way through the gaps between the labyrinth of pipes. Watase followed close by, making sure Ukita didn't lose his balance.]
  2:   65| [45] [Ukita pointed further down the path towards an object that had come into view.]
  3:  127| [47] [Ukita]
  4:  130| [45] ["... If memory serves me right, that large tank over there is full of water, nitrogen gas, and other fire extinguishing agents."]
  5:  138| [47] [Watase]
  6:  141| [45] ["Nitrogen gas?"]
  7:  167| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  170| [45] ["It's used to extinguish fires where liquids can't. Think about it: you couldn't use water to put out fires in a place like where 'Brain Cell' is, could you?"]
  9:  178| [47] [Watase]
 10:  181| [45] ["I see... then what's that real thick pipe over there for?"]
 11:  186| [45] [Next to the tank was a thick pipe that crossed near the engine room's ceiling.]
 12:  233| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  236| [45] ["That... I believe that is a coolant pipe for the nuclear reactor. It brings in water from a nearby lake."]
 14:  244| [47] [Watase]
 15:  247| [45] ["A lake, huh..."]
 16:  252| [45] [An idea suddenly flashed through Watase's head.]
 17:  279| [47] [Watase]
 18:  282| [45] ["I know! Couldn't we go through that pipe and escape into the lake!?"]
 19:  308| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  311| [45] ["That'd be impossible."]
 21:  319| [47] [Watase]
 22:  322| [45] ["Huh? Why's that?"]
 23:  348| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  351| [45] ["I said it was a -coolant- pipe, right? That means it's full of water circulating at high speeds."]
 25:  359| [47] [Ukita]
 26:  362| [45] ["If you were to break a hole in the pipe to get inside, water would pour out of it with the force of a tidal wave, flooding the entire basement. Everyone would be killed."]
 27:  370| [47] [Watase]
 28:  373| [45] ["I-I see... is there a way to shut off the flow of water?"]
 29:  399| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  402| [45] ["I don't know. Even if there were, escape would still be impossible."]
 31:  428| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  431| [45] ["It's 500 meters to the lake from here. Think you could make it that far while holding your breath?"]
 33:  439| [47] [Watase]
 34:  442| [45] ["Then what if we used an air tank--"]
 35:  468| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  471| [45] ["Actually, that's a good idea... or at least it would be, if there were enough air tanks and masks for everyone."]
 37:  476| [47] [Watase]
 38:  477| [45] ["..."]
 39:  503| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  506| [45] ["Well, even if we did, the water used by the coolant is heated by the reactor."]
 41:  514| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  517| [45] ["I believe it's over 50 degrees Celsius. Not a temperature one can hope to withstand."]
 43:  522| [45] [So it really was impossible to escape through the pipe: in a number of ways.]
 44:  527| [45] [Watase's shoulders slumped in disappointment.]
 45:  535| [47] [Watase]
 46:  538| [45] ["I see... and here I thought it was a good idea."]
 47:  564| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  567| [45] ["Unfortunately, no. Even I considered right away if it was possible."]
 49:  593| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  596| [45] ["But I didn't mention it up until now because it was impossible to begin with."]
 51:  604| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  607| [45] ["After all, I believe these things were probably explained to you before you lost your memory, no?"]
 53:  612| [45] [Those sarcastic words hit too close to home.]
 54:  620| [47] [Watase]
 55:  623| [45] ["I see... I'm sorry, but I don't remember that at all..."]
 56:  695| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  698| [45] ["Then you can't say it's as simple as your 'memories being hazy'."]
 58:  706| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  709| [45] ["Are you sure you don't remember anything? Such as why you went down to the basement,%Nor the names of the people you were trying to save?"]
 60:  717| [47] [Watase]
 61:  720| [45] ["Nothing... Tachibana said my memories would return in time, but it seems it's taking a while..."]
 62:  725| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  726| [45] ["..."]
 64:  731| [45] [Ukita went quiet. He looked at Watase with a somewhat doubtful expression.]
 65:  743| [45] [Realizing it was only natural for Ukita to be that way, Watase continued.]
 66:  751| [47] [Watase]
 67:  754| [45] ["I hate to break it to you, really, but it's the truth. I'm sorry for being such an unreliable rescue worker."]
 68:  780| [47] [Ukita]
 69:  783| [45] ["So even though you've been like that since a few hours back... you still went to get AD for everyone knowing you could very well die?"]
 70:  791| [47] [Watase]
 71:  794| [45] ["Yeah... after all, there's not much I can do as I am now."]
 72:  802| [47] [Watase]
 73:  805| [45] ["My body's still strong even without my memories. So I feel I have to make up for my lack of knowledge with my physical abilities."]
 74:  813| [47] [Ukita]
 75:  816| [45] ["Because radiation is more terrifying than gas?"]
 76:  824| [47] [Watase]
 77:  827| [45] ["Of course. The thing I'm most scared about is us not having AD, obviously."]
 78:  835| [47] [Watase]
 79:  838| [45] ["But thanks to my little anaerobic exercise back there, it looks like we'll still live another hour longer."]
 80:  843| [45] [Ukita stared at Watase for a while-- but eventually settled for a snort.]
 81:  869| [47] [Ukita]
 82:  872| [45] ["... That is indeed quite impressive."]
 83:  898| [47] [Ukita]
 84:  901| [45] ["I realize I never thanked you before now. You have my sincerest gratitude."]
 85:  912| [47] [Watase]
 86:  915| [45] ["What's this all about, Mr. Ukita... don't tell me you're doubting me?"]
 87:  941| [47] [Ukita]
 88:  944| [45] ["Oh, no-- but you still went to get AD for everyone in spite of your condition?"]
 89:  952| [47] [Watase]
 90:  955| [45] ["Yeah... after all, there's not much I can do as I am now."]
 91:  963| [47] [Watase]
 92:  966| [45] ["My body's still strong even without my memories. So I feel I have to make up for my lack of knowledge with my physical abilities."]
 93:  974| [47] [Ukita]
 94:  977| [45] ["Because radiation is more terrifying than gas? That's why you took such a huge risk just now?"]
 95:  985| [47] [Watase]
 96:  988| [45] ["... Okay Mr. Ukita, exactly what is it that you're trying to say?"]
 97:  996| [47] [Watase]
 98:  999| [45] ["Are you saying it would have been better if I hadn't gotten any AD or something?"]
 99: 1025| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1028| [45] ["Wh-what a preposterous accusation...!"]
101: 1054| [47] [Ukita]
102: 1057| [45] ["I just, well... I just wanted say that it seemed to be quite 'impressive' for someone who doesn't have memories to do that."]
103: 1065| [47] [Watase]
104: 1068| [45] ["Wh-what's gotten into you... I'm not -that- happy about getting a compliment from you, old man."]
105: 1094| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1097| [45] ["Who're you calling an old man? I'm only 35. I'm not that much older than you, right?"]
107: 1105| [47] [Watase]
108: 1108| [45] ["Now that you mention it, that's true... well, as fellow old men, it's our duty to work together and help these girls out."]
109: 1113| [45] [He thought it was a bit rude-- but he felt feelings of kinship towards Ukita welling up inside him when he called the latter "old man".]
110: 1118| [45] [That term felt like it naturally suited Ukita, probably because his appearance and white hair made him look much older than he actually was.]
111: 1123| [45] [Ukita didn't particularly seem to mind. However, he suddenly came to a stop.]
112: 1149| [47] [Ukita]
113: 1152| [45] ["Whoa there... we've made it. This is it."]
114: 1187| [45] [Watase looked and saw that there were countless valves next to the tank.]
115: 1213| [47] [Ukita]
116: 1216| [45] ["It appears that these valves are closed for some reason."]
117: 1224| [47] [Watase]
118: 1227| [45] ["So they really were running an inspection on them...?"]
119: 1253| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1256| [45] ["We can't say for sure now. Anyway, the sprinkler system should reactivate if we open them up."]
121: 1264| [47] [Watase]
122: 1267| [45] ["All right! Lend me a hand, old man!"]
123: 1275| [47] [Ukita]
124: 1278| [45] ["Very well."]
125: 1311| [45] [After that exchange, Watase and Ukita turned the valves one after another.]
126: 1351| [45] [The tank began to groan, and the pipes connected to it all started vibrating at once.]
127: 1377| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1380| [45] ["... Good, this should take care of matters."]
129: 1388| [47] [Watase]
130: 1391| [45] ["I hope this takes out the fires in Area N too..."]
131: 1417| [47] [Ukita]
132: 1420| [45] ["No, unfortunately, it seems that the sprinklers in that area use a separate system."]
133: 1428| [47] [Watase]
134: 1431| [45] ["I see..."]
135: 1436| [45] [But just having the fires in the other areas all taken care of was more than enough.]
136: 1444| [47] [Watase]
137: 1447| [45] ["Anyway, shall we go report our success to the others?"]
138: 1455| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1458| [45] ["No, I'll stay here for a while and make sure the system is operating normally."]
140: 1466| [47] [Watase]
141: 1469| [45] ["Sorry, thanks."]
142: 1474| [45] [Watase then parted ways with Ukita and headed back to Kazami.]
143: 1568| [45] [--When he got back to the ladder area, Kazami called out to him.]
144: 1676| [47] [Kazami]
145: 1679| [45] ["Oh, welcome back, Captain."]
146: 1684| [45] [Yuuri was still lying on the floor, but Jun and Ena were already up and about.]
147: 1761| [47] [Watase]
148: 1764| [45] ["Oh, so you guys are up and running again?"]
149: 1790| [47] [Ena]
150: 1793| [45] ["Yes... thank you for helping us..."]
151: 1819| [47] [Jun]
152: 1822| [45] ["C-Captain, I'm so ashamed of myself... I wanna bury myself in a hole after fainting right after a dramatic exit like that..."]
153: 1838| [47] [Watase]
154: 1841| [45] ["What're you talking about? You were the one who opened that gate. You have nothing to be ashamed of."]
155: 1867| [47] [Jun]
156: 1870| [45] ["R-really...?"]
157: 1878| [47] [Watase]
158: 1881| [45] ["Really. You should be proud of yourself."]
159: 1907| [47] [Jun]
160: 1910| [45] ["Heheh... you sure are nice today, Captain~..."]
161: 1915| [45] [A smile rose to Jun's pale face.]
162: 1920| [45] [Kazami also seemed relieved.]
163: 1948| [47] [Kazami]
164: 1951| [45] ["He's right. We were also able to get some AD thanks to you."]
165: 1962| [47] [Watase]
166: 1965| [45] ["It's okay Moribe, don't worry about it."]
167: 1991| [47] [Jun]
168: 1994| [45] ["Yeah, but..."]
169: 1999| [45] [After seeing Jun's long face, Kazami kindly spoke to her.]
170: 2027| [47] [Kazami]
171: 2030| [45] ["Moribe, there's no need to get depressed."]
172: 2038| [47] [Kazami]
173: 2041| [45] ["It was thanks to your opening of that gate that we were able to get some AD."]
174: 2067| [47] [Jun]
175: 2070| [45] ["Huh... you found AD?"]
176: 2078| [47] [Watase]
177: 2081| [45] ["Yeah, we administered it to you while you guys were out of it."]
178: 2107| [47] [Jun]
179: 2110| [45] ["Oh thank God, now we can take it a bit easy, huh?"]
180: 2136| [47] [Ena]
181: 2139| [45] ["You're right... and it also appears the sprinkler system is back online."]
182: 2147| [47] [Watase]
183: 2150| [45] ["Yeah, now we don't have to worry so much about getting taken out by a fire."]
184: 2158| [47] [Kazami]
185: 2161| [45] ["And if it takes out the source of the fire downstairs, we'll be able to walk around normally soon enough."]
186: 2187| [47] [Ena]
187: 2190| [45] ["Hey, how long will it take for the sprinkler system to finish extinguishing and ventilating everything?"]
188: 2216| [47] [Kazami]
189: 2219| [45] ["Let me see... About ten minutes or so, I believe."]
190: 2224| [45] [It was a bit troubling that they were stuck here for a while, but--]
191: 2229| [47] [Watase]
192: 2230| [45] [(But now that I think about, all of us must be tired...)]
193: 2235| [45] [If someone with a body like Watase's was tired, then it was probably worse for everyone else.]
194: 2243| [47] [Watase]
195: 2246| [45] ["... Then why don't we take a little break until Yuuri wakes up?"]
196: 2272| [47] [Kazami]
197: 2275| [45] ["That sounds good. After all, there isn't much else we can do for the moment."]
198: 2301| [47] [Jun]
199: 2304| [45] ["Amen to that."]
200: 2387| [45] [And so the group decided to take a rest while the sprinkler system did its work.]
