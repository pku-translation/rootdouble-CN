  1:  114| [47] [Ukita]
  2:  117| [45] ["Dammit, lost sight of him...!"]
  3:  186| [47] [Watase]
  4:  189| [45] ["... Sounds like they're gone."]
  5:  224| [47] [Ena]
  6:  227| [45] ["Yes..."]
  7:  232| [45] [Watase and Ena had escaped their pursuers and were now hiding in a room in Area 2's inner ring.]
  8:  258| [47] [Ena]
  9:  261| [45] ["... I didn't expect things to turn violent so suddenly."]
 10:  269| [47] [Watase]
 11:  272| [45] ["Well, it's not that surprising... not when you consider the number of dead bodies we've seen."]
 12:  280| [47] [Watase]
 13:  283| [45] ["I can understand how their anger and impatience are driving them crazy..."]
 14:  309| [47] [Ena]
 15:  312| [45] ["True... but that really was a close call back there."]
 16:  338| [47] [Ena]
 17:  341| [45] ["If they'd caught us-- then they might have very well killed us for all we know."]
 18:  349| [47] [Watase]
 19:  352| [45] ["Killed us...!? Wait, are you serious!?"]
 20:  360| [47] [Watase]
 21:  363| [45] ["You don't honestly think they'd go that far, do you!? They're still our companions!"]
 22:  368| [45] [A stern expression appeared on Ena's face when she heard his protests.]
 23:  394| [47] [Ena]
 24:  397| [45] ["You still don't get it?"]
 25:  405| [47] [Ena]
 26:  408| [45] ["The thing that's truly frightening in this hell isn't fire or radiation--"]
 27:  434| [47] [Ena]
 28:  437| [45] ["It's people."]
 29:  445| [47] [Ena]
 30:  448| [45] ["Yes... nothing is more terrifying than the raw malice of someone with their back to the wall."]
 31:  456| [47] [Watase]
 32:  459| [45] ["..."]
 33:  464| [45] [Watase gasped.]
 34:  546| [45] [--He'd thought that their only hope in this death-ridden facility had been "the human will to survive".]
 35:  551| [45] [But now that things had gone to hell, it was likely the other way around.]
 36:  556| [47] [Watase]
 37:  557| [45] [(What happens when the "human will to survive" transcends "human morals"...?)]
 38:  562| [47] [Watase]
 39:  563| [45] [(Does it become the will to survive... "even at the cost of killing others"!?)]
 40:  568| [47] [Watase]
 41:  569| [45] [(Or maybe it becomes the conviction that "killing others is justifiable if it means protecting someone else"...!)]
 42:  574| [45] [In any normal situation, Ukita and Jun would probably never even dream about considering those things.]
 43:  579| [45] [But now everyone's lives were at risk. Their morals were most likely being shaved down to a layer of thin ice.]
 44:  584| [45] [Possibly enough to justify murder in their minds--]
 45:  589| [47] [Watase]
 46:  590| [45] [(Dammit, how did things come to this...)]
 47:  595| [47] [Watase]
 48:  596| [45] [(Why!? I thought we were all on the same side here...!)]
 49:  601| [45] [The problem was whether the others felt the same way. And they probably didn't.]
 50:  618| [45] [Watase breathed a heavy sigh and turned to Ena.]
 51:  626| [47] [Watase]
 52:  629| [45] ["... Hey, can I ask you a question?"]
 53:  655| [47] [Ena]
 54:  658| [45] ["What?"]
 55:  666| [47] [Watase]
 56:  669| [45] ["Why did you stick up for me back there?"]
 57:  677| [47] [Watase]
 58:  680| [45] ["Regardless of what I remember, that video footage proves that I'm suspicious."]
 59:  703| [47] [Ena]
 60:  704| [45] ["..."]
 61:  712| [47] [Watase]
 62:  715| [45] ["Weren't you the one who told me to doubt everything?"]
 63:  723| [47] [Watase]
 64:  726| [45] ["So why are you..."]
 65:  731| [45] [Faced with the others having seemingly gone mad, and beginning to doubt even his own memories, Watase wondered what Ena was truly after.]
 66:  736| [45] [Ena then spoke in a somewhat hesitant voice.]
 67:  762| [47] [Ena]
 68:  765| [45] ["... Because I want to know what your real motives are too."]
 69:  773| [47] [Watase]
 70:  776| [45] ["...?"]
 71:  802| [47] [Ena]
 72:  805| [45] ["Hey... you said that you saw Ms. Yuuri's body, right?"]
 73:  813| [47] [Ena]
 74:  816| [45] ["How do you explain that?"]
 75:  824| [47] [Watase]
 76:  827| [45] ["I... think it was my eyes playing tricks on me, just like the old man said."]
 77:  835| [47] [Watase]
 78:  838| [45] ["I'm suffering from memory impairment, and I've been in contaminated zones a few times..."]
 79:  846| [47] [Watase]
 80:  849| [45] ["... It wouldn't be odd for me to be seeing things."]
 81:  854| [45] [He was reminded of something Kazami had said way back then.]
 82:  859| [45] ["Radiation exposure causes severely negative effects on the human body."]
 83:  864| [45] ["This includes skin inflammation, nausea, organ failure, brain cell damage, vision impairment, neurological disorders, genetic disorders, and cancer."]
 84:  869| [45] [--Vision impairment, neurological disorders, and brain cell damage. Any one of those could have caused Watase to hallucinate seeing a corpse.]
 85:  877| [47] [Watase]
 86:  880| [45] ["And to be honest... I've been hearing this auditory hallucination from time to time ever since I woke up."]
 87:  906| [47] [Ena]
 88:  909| [45] ["... An auditory hallucination?"]
 89:  917| [47] [Watase]
 90:  920| [45] ["Yeah... I figured you'd all think I was nuts if I mentioned it, so I've been keeping quiet about it this whole time..."]
 91:  928| [47] [Watase]
 92:  931| [45] ["At first, I thought it was being caused by that 'BC' thing you mentioned earlier."]
 93:  939| [47] [Watase]
 94:  942| [45] ["But... the auditory hallucination aside, there's no such BC out there that can cause someone to hallucinate, right?"]
 95:  968| [47] [Ena]
 96:  971| [45] ["Y-you're right..."]
 97:  979| [47] [Watase]
 98:  982| [45] ["So maybe... I've just gone crazy. Simple as that."]
 99:  987| [45] [Feelings of abandonment seized Watase.]
100:  999| [45] [--But at that moment...]
101: 1004| [45] [Watase's head suddenly started hurting and his skin felt numb.]
102: 1009| [45] [It was just like the time he'd been in a contaminated zone--]
103: 1017| [47] [Watase]
104: 1020| [45] ["!!"]
105: 1025| [45] [Watase checked his watch.]
106: 1030| [45] [It was past time for them to take AD.]
107: 1038| [47] [Watase]
108: 1041| [45] ["Crap! Teach, administer your AD!"]
109: 1067| [47] [Ena]
110: 1070| [45] ["R-right!"]
111: 1082| [45] [Watase and Ena frantically injected themselves with their last AD.]
112: 1087| [45] [Watase felt his headache settle down immediately as he did so.]
113: 1093| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5976 mSv".]
114: 1099| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5878 mSv".]
115: 1105| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5726 mSv".]
116: 1111| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5670 mSv".]
117: 1119| [47] [Watase]
118: 1122| [45] ["Now we really can't live without the AD...!"]
119: 1127| [45] [In other words, Watase and the others only had an hour left to live.]
120: 1134| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5672 mSv".]
121: 1140| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5521 mSv".]
122: 1146| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5472 mSv".]
123: 1152| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5326 mSv".]
124: 1158| [45] [The Procyon's reading was at "5276 mSv".]
125: 1163| [45] [They had less than an hour until their next AD injection.]
126: 1168| [45] [At this radiation level, they'd instantly show life-threatening symptoms of radiation exposure once their AD wore off.]
127: 1176| [47] [Watase]
128: 1179| [45] ["... I mean, think about it: it's been a real long time since it passed the first danger standard."]
129: 1187| [47] [Watase]
130: 1190| [45] ["It's been a few hours since the AD has stopped being enough to protect us from the radiation here... so it's not surprising I've been hallucinating."]
131: 1195| [45] [Watase shuddered. Ena then quietly spoke up.]
132: 1221| [47] [Ena]
133: 1224| [45] ["True... but you know what?"]
134: 1232| [47] [Ena]
135: 1235| [45] ["There's something else that's been bothering me."]
136: 1243| [47] [Watase]
137: 1246| [45] ["Huh?"]
138: 1261| [47] [Ena]
139: 1264| [45] ["You said that it's not surprising that on top of your memory impairment, you've been hallucinating thanks to your trips to the contaminated zones, right?"]
140: 1290| [47] [Ena]
141: 1293| [45] ["But what if radiation wasn't the cause of your hallucinations?"]
142: 1301| [47] [Watase]
143: 1304| [45] ["... What?"]
144: 1330| [47] [Ena]
145: 1333| [45] ["I remember reading something about this before. It's true that radiation can cause vision impairment--"]
146: 1341| [47] [Ena]
147: 1344| [45] ["But that only refers to your sight getting blurry and becoming nearsighted--%Nthere was nothing in there about seeing things that aren't actually there."]
148: 1352| [47] [Watase]
149: 1355| [45] ["Then what's really causing my hallucinations?"]
150: 1363| [47] [Ena]
151: 1366| [45] ["Got any ideas?"]
152: 1374| [47] [Watase]
153: 1377| [45] ["... Nope."]
154: 1382| [45] [Ena's words only served to confuse Watase further.]
155: 1390| [47] [Watase]
156: 1393| [45] ["... But I could be suffering from brain cell damage and neurological disorders."]
157: 1401| [47] [Watase]
158: 1404| [45] ["If my brain and nerves got all messed up, then it's not implausible for me to be seeing things, right?"]
159: 1430| [47] [Ena]
160: 1433| [45] ["True, but... there's something else bothering me."]
161: 1441| [47] [Ena]
162: 1444| [45] ["Take a look at this."]
163: 1449| [45] [Ena took out her PDA.]
164: 1454| [45] [She then fiddled around with it, causing words to appear on the screen.]
165: 1462| [47] [Watase]
166: 1465| [45] ["... What's this?"]
167: 1491| [47] [Ena]
168: 1494| [45] ["You remember how Mr. Ukita was yelling at me when I was looking around the neuroscience laboratory all by myself?"]
169: 1502| [47] [Watase]
170: 1505| [45] ["Yeah, now that you mention it..."]
171: 1513| [47] [Ena]
172: 1516| [45] ["The truth is, his anger was more justified than he thought."]
173: 1524| [47] [Ena]
174: 1527| [45] ["I secretly copied data from the neuroscience laboratory's computers onto my PDA."]
175: 1535| [47] [Watase]
176: 1538| [45] ["You did what!? Why!?"]
177: 1546| [47] [Ena]
178: 1549| [45] ["I was already convinced by that point that this accident was no ordinary accident."]
179: 1575| [47] [Ena]
180: 1578| [45] ["It's odd that it would take nine hours for them to lift the lockdown, isn't it?%NSo I was wondering if there was some other reason for that..."]
181: 1586| [47] [Watase]
182: 1589| [45] ["Good question..."]
183: 1615| [47] [Ena]
184: 1618| [45] ["But the data I copied was all encrypted."]
185: 1644| [47] [Ena]
186: 1647| [45] ["I've tried decrypting it by myself for the time being... but most of the data's damaged."]
187: 1652| [45] [Watase remembered that Ena had indeed been fiddling around with her PDA from time to time in the last few hours for some reason.]
188: 1660| [47] [Watase]
189: 1663| [45] ["So you weren't actually checking your map, but instead trying to decrypt the data?"]
190: 1689| [47] [Ena]
191: 1692| [45] ["Yes. I was able to discover some barely readable data as a result."]
192: 1697| [45] [Ena then handed over her PDA to Watase.]
193: 1702| [45] [On-screen was what appeared to be sentences from a report of sorts.]

254: 2099| [45] [But it was soon cast aside for another emotion.]

266: 2207| [45] ["!!"]

268: 2217| [45] [It was as if his brain was refusing to let him remember.]

283: 2337| [47] [Watase]
284: 2340| [45] ["... I see... but I don't remember anything."]
285: 2348| [47] [Watase]
286: 2351| [45] ["I believe that the hallucinations I've been having truly are due to abnormalities in my brain."]
287: 2359| [47] [Watase]
288: 2362| [45] ["Including my amnesia..."]
289: 2367| [45] [It did seem like the cause of Watase's frequent headaches and memory problems really did lie in his brain.]
290: 2425| [47] [Watase]
291: 2428| [45] ["In that case, maybe I really did steal the AD... and don't even remember it."]
292: 2436| [47] [Watase]
293: 2439| [45] ["I can't confidently deny the possibility that a part of me's okay with letting everyone else die so long as I survive...!"]
294: 2444| [45] [Watase suddenly began to get scared. Very scared.]
295: 2449| [45] [Perhaps there was a "wicked" side to him that he was not aware of-- one that was deciding all his actions on its own and driving everyone to their deaths--]
296: 2454| [45] [That thought was much more frightening than the prospect of his own death.]
297: 2471| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 6]
298: 2479| [45] [But-- Ena spoke to Watase with a kind voice when she saw him trembling.]
299: 2505| [47] [Ena]
300: 2508| [45] ["Get a hold of yourself, Captain Kasasagi... You're not that kind of person."]
301: 2516| [47] [Watase]
302: 2519| [45] ["... Huh?"]
303: 2527| [47] [Ena]
304: 2530| [45] ["You are indeed suspicious-- your amnesia and the security footage attest to that."]
305: 2556| [47] [Ena]
306: 2559| [45] ["But even when I take that into account, I want to trust you."]
307: 2567| [47] [Watase]
308: 2570| [45] ["... Why?"]
309: 2596| [47] [Ena]
310: 2599| [45] ["Because the indisputable truth is that you have been pushing yourself to your limits to save people."]
311: 2607| [47] [Ena]
312: 2610| [45] ["You even ran into a contaminated zone to save a student of mine even though you didn't even know her..."]
313: 2615| [47] [Watase]
314: 2616| [45] ["..."]
315: 2642| [47] [Ena]
316: 2645| [45] ["It's not important that you have amnesia or that you had a hallucination."]
317: 2671| [47] [Ena]
318: 2674| [45] ["As long as you stay the way you are now... as long you're 'Captain Kasasagi'... I am on your side."]
319: 2679| [45] [Ena gazed straight at Watase.]
320: 2684| [45] [Watase couldn't bear to look her in the eye. He hung his head and answered:]
321: 2692| [47] [Watase]
322: 2695| [45] ["Thank you, Teach..."]
323: 2700| [45] [There was someone out there who would say they were on his side when even he didn't trust himself--]
324: 2705| [45] [Watase was grateful for that more than anything else at the moment.]
325: 2713| [47] [Watase]
326: 2716| [45] ["But... what do we do? Moribe and old man Ukita don't trust me at all, you know?"]
327: 2742| [47] [Ena]
328: 2745| [45] ["That's true. So that's why--"]
329: 2753| [47] [Ena]
330: 2756| [45] ["I'll go convince them."]
331: 2764| [47] [Watase]
332: 2767| [45] ["Wha... you're not saying you plan to go alone, are you?"]
333: 2793| [47] [Ena]
334: 2796| [45] ["Of course I am. If you came along with me with things being the way they are now, all you'd do is make things harder for me."]
335: 2804| [47] [Watase]
336: 2807| [45] ["Well, yeah, I guess, but..."]
337: 2833| [47] [Ena]
338: 2836| [45] ["I'll be right back, so wait here, okay?"]
339: 2853| [45] [And with those words, Ena left the room.]
340: 2866| [45] [No sooner had Ena said that than did Watase feel the anxiety in his heart rapidly spread.]
341: 2874| [47] [Watase]
342: 2877| [45] ["No, hold on! That's too dangerous!"]
343: 2903| [47] [Ena]
344: 2906| [45] ["Huh?"]
345: 2914| [47] [Watase]
346: 2917| [45] ["Those guys are already suspicious of you after the whole gun incident."]
347: 2925| [47] [Watase]
348: 2928| [45] ["Anything could happen if they see you now."]
349: 2954| [47] [Ena]
350: 2957| [45] ["But... then what are we supposed to do?"]
351: 2965| [47] [Ena]
352: 2968| [45] ["We can't search for AD, the survivors, or an escape route in these circumstances, right?"]
353: 2994| [47] [Ena]
354: 2997| [45] ["We're screwed unless we can persuade the others!"]
355: 3005| [47] [Watase]
356: 3008| [45] ["...!"]
357: 3013| [45] [The situation did indeed look hopeless.]
358: 3018| [45] [Even if they could persuade Jun and Ukita, that wouldn't change the fact that they didn't have enough AD.]
359: 3023| [45] [Everyone would be exposed to radiation in just another hour.]
360: 3028| [45] [They'd struggled as hard as they could for the last five hours, but in the end--]
361: 3033| [47] [Watase]
362: 3034| [45] [(Now that I think about it, we haven't solved any of our problems...!)]
363: 3039| [45] [They hadn't found the survivors, to say the least of Yuuri.]
364: 3044| [45] [Someone with a gun could be hiding down there with them.]
365: 3049| [45] [His once trusted allies now saw him as their enemy.]
366: 3057| [47] [Watase]
367: 3060| [45] ["But even if we can't persuade them... all we have to do is find a way that'll let everyone survive."]
368: 3086| [47] [Ena]
369: 3089| [45] ["Well, of course! But do you really think any such way exists!?"]
370: 3094| [45] [He didn't. All normal methods were impossible.]
371: 3099| [45] [If there had been a way, then they would have done it ages ago.]
372: 3104| [47] [Watase]
373: 3105| [45] [(But what if we've been thinking about this the wrong way the whole time...!?)]
374: 3110| [47] [Watase]
375: 3111| [45] [(Is there a method that we haven't thought of yet...?)]
376: 3116| [47] [Watase]
377: 3117| [45] [(If it means running into a danger we've avoided up until now... or putting my own life on the line...)]
378: 3122| [47] [Watase]
379: 3123| [45] [(If I'm prepared for that, then what's the first method I can do...!?)]
380: 3128| [45] [Words that he had heard a while back--]
381: 3133| [45] [Replayed themselves in Watase's mind.]
382: 3280| [47] [Commander]
383: 3283| [45] ["It seems that there's still a huge fire going on in Area N, which is where the reactor is located--"]
384: 3288| [47] [Commander]
385: 3291| [45] ["The security's system's gone haywire thanks to that, which means in theory that we can no longer access it externally."]
386: 3384| [47] [Watase]
387: 3387| [45] ["!!"]
388: 3392| [45] [A lightbulb went off in his head.]
389: 3397| [45] [A wide smile then spontaneously adorned his cheeks.]
390: 3423| [47] [Ena]
391: 3426| [45] ["Wh-what is it?"]
392: 3431| [45] [Watase answered Ena's puzzled question with a subdued voice.]
393: 3439| [47] [Watase]
394: 3442| [45] ["... Teach."]
395: 3450| [47] [Watase]
396: 3453| [45] ["I thought of a way to solve all our problems."]
397: 3479| [47] [Ena]
398: 3482| [45] ["... Huh?"]
399: 3490| [47] [Watase]
400: 3493| [45] ["The answer was right there at the very beginning."]
401: 3501| [47] [Watase]
402: 3504| [45] ["I already knew long ago how to save everyone."]
403: 3530| [47] [Ena]
404: 3533| [45] ["Wh... what are you talking about!?"]
405: 3559| [47] [Ena]
406: 3562| [45] ["Why'd you keep it a secret if you knew all along!?"]
407: 3570| [47] [Watase]
408: 3573| [45] ["Shh!"]
409: 3578| [45] [Watase put his index finger to his lips.]
410: 3636| [45] [Ena went quiet with a start.]
411: 3644| [47] [Watase]
412: 3647| [45] ["Don't shout... we're done for if Moribe and the old man realize we're in here."]
413: 3673| [47] [Ena]
414: 3676| [45] ["Do you really... know what to do?"]
415: 3684| [47] [Watase]
416: 3687| [45] ["Yeah. I'll tell you and you alone. Listen up."]
417: 3713| [47] [Ena]
418: 3716| [45] ["...?"]
419: 3743| [45] [Ena walked up to Watase in surprise.]
420: 3748| [45] [He then brought his mouth to her ear--]
421: 3756| [47] [Watase]
422: 3759| [45] ["Listen up. That method..."]
423: 3767| [47] [Watase]
424: 3770| [45] ["... is for me to sacrifice my life."]
425: 3775| [45] [and whispered those decisive words.]
426: 3801| [47] [Ena]
427: 3804| [45] ["Huh!?"]
428: 3809| [45] [Ena's eyes widened.]
429: 3814| [45] [Watase then slipped behind her and got her in a chokehold.]
430: 3875| [47] [Ena]
431: 3878| [45] ["Ghh!"]
432: 3924| [45] [Watase paid no attention to Ena's pained grunts and kept squeezing her neck.]
433: 3985| [47] [Ena]
434: 3988| [45] ["*cough*...! Wh-why...!?"]
435: 3996| [47] [Watase]
436: 3999| [45] ["... I'm sorry."]
437: 4007| [47] [Watase]
438: 4010| [45] ["Now that you know, you would've tried to stop me, right? So I'm sorry, but I'll need you to take a little nap here for a while."]
439: 4071| [47] [Ena]
440: 4074| [45] ["..."]
441: 4079| [45] [Before long, strength left Ena's body.]
442: 4099| [45] [Watase laid her on the floor.]
443: 4157| [85] [{Wha... what do you think you're you doing!?}]
444: 4158| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
445: 4159| [86] [{Wha... what do you think you're you doing!?}]
446: 4187| [45] [He heard the auditory hallucination echo through his head again.]
447: 4192| [45] [It no longer even surprised him.]
448: 4197| [45] [So he paid no heed to it and left the room.]
