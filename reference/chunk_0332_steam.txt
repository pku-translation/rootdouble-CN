  0:   79| [45] [One clear day about a week later--]
  1:   84| [45] [Jun and Nagisa went out to Center Street to do some shopping.]
  2:   89| [45] [They wanted to give Kazami a present as thanks for always working so hard.]
  3:  118| [45] [The two girls talked as they looked at the shops that lined the street.]
  4:  126| [47] [Jun]
  5:  129| [45] ["Hmm, what should we buy?"]
  6:  155| [47] [Nagisa]
  7:  158| [45] ["What do you think Sis would like?"]
  8:  166| [47] [Jun]
  9:  169| [45] ["Come to think of it, Kazami's so pretty, yet she doesn't wear all that much trendy stuff, does she?"]
 10:  177| [47] [Jun]
 11:  180| [45] ["I think an accessory or something'd look great on her."]
 12:  206| [47] [Nagisa]
 13:  209| [45] ["That sounds good. Then what should we get?"]
 14:  235| [47] [Nagisa]
 15:  238| [45] ["Earrings? Or maybe a ring?"]
 16:  246| [47] [Jun]
 17:  249| [45] ["Hmm... oh, I know, then how about that one thing?"]
 18:  257| [47] [Jun]
 19:  260| [45] ["You know that, uh, that necklace thingy that pops open."]
 20:  286| [47] [Nagisa]
 21:  289| [45] ["Pops open?"]
 22:  297| [47] [Jun]
 23:  300| [45] ["Y'know, that thing people put photos in and wear around their neck."]
 24:  326| [47] [Nagisa]
 25:  329| [45] ["You mean a locket?"]
 26:  337| [47] [Jun]
 27:  340| [45] ["Yeah, that's the one!"]
 28:  345| [45] [Nagisa was a very smart girl for her age-- she hadn't even started elementary school,%Nyet she was more knowledgeable than Jun.]
 29:  350| [45] [Jun hated studying, so it didn't bother her at all that Nagisa was so much smarter.]
 30:  358| [47] [Jun]
 31:  361| [45] ["If we got her a locket, she could probably put a photo of you in it."]
 32:  369| [47] [Jun]
 33:  372| [45] ["Then your sis could always be with you."]
 34:  398| [47] [Nagisa]
 35:  401| [45] ["I see. Yeah, that's a great idea!"]
 36:  409| [47] [Jun]
 37:  412| [45] ["Okay, then let's find us a locket!"]
 38:  417| [45] [Jun and Nagisa checked around the accessory shops.]
 39:  469| [45] [They finally found a locket in the third one they went to.]
 40:  474| [45] [It cost 3500 yen.]
 41:  479| [45] [Jun said she'd cover the whole cost, but--]
 42:  511| [47] [Nagisa]
 43:  514| [45] ["No Jun, I think I should pay half."]
 44:  522| [47] [Jun]
 45:  525| [45] ["Huh, y'sure about that?"]
 46:  551| [47] [Nagisa]
 47:  554| [45] ["I've saved up my allowance, and I'd feel bad about making you pay for it all."]
 48:  562| [47] [Jun]
 49:  565| [45] ["Okay, that does sound better. Then it can be like a present from the both of us."]
 50:  591| [47] [Nagisa]
 51:  594| [45] ["Right? So we'll each pay 1750 yen..."]
 52:  602| [47] [Jun]
 53:  605| [45] ["... And buy this locket!"]
 54:  659| [45] [And so the two of them obtained Kazami's present.]
 55:  732| [45] [They chatted on their way back to the Tachibana residence.]
 56:  758| [47] [Nagisa]
 57:  761| [45] ["You think Sis will like it?"]
 58:  769| [47] [Jun]
 59:  772| [45] ["You kidding? I bet she'll be moved to tears by it."]
 60:  780| [47] [Jun]
 61:  783| [45] ["'Cause Kazami loves you so much."]
 62:  809| [47] [Nagisa]
 63:  812| [45] ["Y-you think so?"]
 64:  817| [45] [Nagisa said that with embarrassment. It looked as if she was aware of how much her sister loved her.]
 65:  822| [45] [Jun suddenly got jealous when she saw that.]
 66:  830| [47] [Jun]
 67:  833| [45] ["... You're so lucky that you have such a nice sister, Nagisa."]
 68:  859| [47] [Nagisa]
 69:  862| [45] ["Huh?"]
 70:  870| [47] [Jun]
 71:  873| [45] ["No one in my family gets along... I always hate being in that house."]
 72:  881| [47] [Jun]
 73:  884| [45] ["Daddy rarely comes home, Mommy's always going off somewhere, and all my meals are made by my housekeeper."]
 74:  892| [47] [Jun]
 75:  895| [45] ["... I just feel so lonely sometimes."]
 76:  903| [47] [Jun]
 77:  906| [45] ["I don't need a big house. I just want my family to get along... just like you and your sis do."]
 78:  929| [47] [Nagisa]
 79:  930| [45] ["..."]
 80:  938| [47] [Jun]
 81:  941| [45] ["... Forget I said that. Sorry, I don't know what the heck got into me!"]
 82:  949| [47] [Jun]
 83:  952| [45] ["Boy, it must have been a real pain to hear me whine like that."]
 84:  957| [45] [Just when Jun started to get embarrassed about complaining to a 6 year old-- Nagisa spoke up with determination in her voice.]
 85: 1011| [47] [Nagisa]
 86: 1014| [45] ["... Th-then you should live with us too!"]
 87: 1022| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1025| [45] ["Huh?"]
 89: 1051| [47] [Nagisa]
 90: 1054| [45] ["I like you, and I'm sure Sis likes you too."]
 91: 1062| [47] [Nagisa]
 92: 1065| [45] ["If you lived with us, then the three of us could be one happy family! You wouldn't be lonely at all!"]
 93: 1073| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1076| [45] ["Nagisa..."]
 95: 1081| [45] [Jun stared at Nagisa, who looked absolutely pleased with herself.]
 96: 1086| [47] [Jun]
 97: 1087| [45] [(Ah... stupid me, I made a little girl worry about me...)]
 98: 1092| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1093| [45] [(She's trying to be so nice to me even though she's got no mom or dad. She must be just as lonely, but she still...)]
100: 1098| [45] [It was a proposal that made her feel so pathetic, yet it also sounded so charming.]
101: 1106| [47] [Jun]
102: 1109| [45] ["... That'd be nice. Then I guess that'd make you my little sister?"]
103: 1135| [47] [Nagisa]
104: 1138| [45] ["Yep. Then that'd mean I'd have two big sisters."]
105: 1146| [47] [Jun]
106: 1149| [45] ["Then when Kazami gets married..."]
107: 1175| [47] [Nagisa]
108: 1178| [45] ["Her husband would be my Daddy. Then I'd have a complete family, right?"]
109: 1183| [45] [That's not exactly how it worked, but it was a very joyful dream nonetheless.]
110: 1188| [45] [Kazami would definitely make a good mom.]
111: 1193| [45] [Her cooking was also top-class. Her husband would no doubt be a wonderful man.]
112: 1198| [45] [Once she got married, Kazami would be free from her day to day job. Then Nagisa could act more like a child of her age.]
113: 1203| [45] [Jun imagined that ideal family in her head.]
114: 1208| [47] [Jun]
115: 1209| [45] [(An outsider like me shouldn't even be there to begin with, but...)]
116: 1214| [45] [Though she knew that, she thought it wouldn't be so bad to immerse herself in that dream.]
117: 1222| [47] [Jun]
118: 1225| [45] ["... Then maybe this present will be just the ticket Kazami needs to snag a hubby?"]
119: 1251| [47] [Nagisa]
120: 1254| [45] ["Yeah!"]
121: 1262| [47] [Jun]
122: 1265| [45] ["All right! Then let's head on home and give this to her!"]
123: 1270| [45] [The two friends then broke off into a run.]
124: 1318| [45] [--Kazami had told Nagisa that she got off work early that day, so she'd be home around 3 PM.]
125: 1323| [45] [So Jun and Nagisa waited in the Tachibana residence for Kazami to get home.]
126: 1346| [45] [Nagisa kept on glancing at the clock, muttering "is it time yet?" to herself.]
127: 1353| [45] [But when the bell chimed 3 PM--]
128: 1518| [45] [It was drowned out by a thunderous roar.]
129: 1526| [47] [Jun]
130: 1529| [45] ["!?"]
131: 1540| [45] [A shock ran through the building, and Jun heard what sounded like something collapsing.]
132: 1595| [45] [A second later, she was struck by an impact--]
133: 1600| [45] [Then passed out.]
134: 1615| [45] [------]
135: 1620| [45] [----]
136: 1625| [45] [--]
137: 1760| [47] [Jun]
138: 1763| [45] ["..."]
139: 1771| [47] [Jun]
140: 1774| [45] ["U-ugh..."]
141: 1779| [45] [Jun woke up to find she was lying face down under something heavy.]
142: 1784| [45] [Her back was being crushed under the weight of what appeared to be rough debris.]
143: 1792| [47] [Jun]
144: 1795| [45] ["Wha... what's going on...!?"]
145: 1800| [45] [Jun was at a complete loss. She had absolutely no idea what had happened.]
146: 1805| [45] [All she knew was that her body was pinned down by something, and she could see little apart from the floor.]
147: 1810| [45] [Nagisa was supposed to be right next to her, but she was nowhere to be found.]
148: 1818| [47] [Jun]
149: 1821| [45] ["N-Nagisa... where are you...?"]
150: 1826| [45] [Her calls were answered by another voice somewhere in the room.]
151: 1834| [47] [Nagisa]
152: 1837| [45] ["J... Jun... are... you okay...?"]
153: 1845| [47] [Jun]
154: 1848| [45] ["N-Nagisa...!"]
155: 1853| [45] [Jun tried to hurry over towards Nagisa.]
156: 1879| [45] [But she couldn't make the debris budge at all no matter how hard she struggled.]
157: 1887| [47] [Jun]
158: 1890| [45] ["H-huh!? Why...!?"]
159: 1898| [47] [Nagisa]
160: 1901| [45] ["S-something blew up... I think the ceiling fell down..."]
161: 1909| [47] [Jun]
162: 1912| [45] ["Blew up!? Nagisa, are you okay!?"]
163: 1920| [47] [Nagisa]
164: 1923| [45] ["I-I can't move either..."]
165: 1931| [47] [Nagisa]
166: 1934| [45] ["I think... I cut my head... I'm bleeding..."]
167: 1942| [47] [Nagisa]
168: 1945| [45] ["... It hurts..."]
169: 1953| [47] [Jun]
170: 1956| [45] ["Nagisa...!"]
171: 1961| [45] [Jun desperately tried to squirm her way out from under the debris.]
172: 1987| [45] [But the debris weighing on her back creaked every time she moved, sounding as though it would collapse at any second.]
173: 1992| [47] [Jun]
174: 1993| [45] [(Th-that sounded way too close... If this thing collapses, I'll be...!)]
175: 2004| [45] [Just then, she heard ambulance sirens in the distance getting closer and closer.]
176: 2012| [47] [Jun]
177: 2015| [45] ["An ambulance..."]
178: 2023| [47] [Nagisa]
179: 2026| [45] ["Yeah..."]
180: 2034| [47] [Jun]
181: 2037| [45] ["I'm sure help is on the way right now. We just need to hang in there..."]
182: 2045| [47] [Nagisa]
183: 2048| [45] ["... Yeah..."]
184: 2053| [45] [Jun and Nagisa held still and waited in the dark room for help to arrive.]
185: 2058| [45] [--...]
186: 2063| [45] [---...]
187: 2068| [45] [----...]
188: 2073| [45] [-----...]
189: 2086| [45] [... But they were taking a long time to get there.]
190: 2091| [45] [Jun talked as much as she could to keep Nagisa calm.]
191: 2099| [47] [Jun]
192: 2102| [45] ["Hey, Nagisa..."]
193: 2118| [47] [Nagisa]
194: 2121| [45] ["Jun...? What is it...?"]
195: 2129| [47] [Jun]
196: 2132| [45] ["Umm... 'bout what we were talking about before..."]
197: 2148| [47] [Nagisa]
198: 2151| [45] ["What we were talking about...?"]
199: 2159| [47] [Jun]
200: 2162| [45] ["Y'know, the thing about me becoming a part of your family..."]
201: 2178| [47] [Jun]
202: 2181| [45] ["... I was just thinking that if that really did happen... it'd probably be so much fun..."]
203: 2189| [47] [Nagisa]
204: 2192| [45] ["Yeah... I'm sure it would be..."]
205: 2197| [47] [Nagisa]
206: 2198| [45] ["..."]
207: 2214| [47] [Nagisa]
208: 2217| [45] ["... Hey, Jun..."]
209: 2225| [47] [Jun]
210: 2228| [45] ["Huh...?"]
211: 2236| [47] [Nagisa]
212: 2239| [45] ["You said you got lonely from time to time earlier..."]
213: 2255| [47] [Nagisa]
214: 2258| [45] ["The thing is, I'm a little lonely too... 'cause I don't have a mom or dad..."]
215: 2266| [47] [Nagisa]
216: 2269| [45] ["So I can't help myself sometimes when Sis is away at work..."]
217: 2285| [47] [Nagisa]
218: 2288| [45] ["So I figured I wouldn't be lonely anymore if you became my big sis too--"]
219: 2293| [45] [Her frail voice was abruptly cut off.]
220: 2309| [47] [Nagisa]
221: 2312| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
222: 2320| [47] [Jun]
223: 2323| [45] ["!? Nagisa, what's wrong!?"]
224: 2339| [47] [Nagisa]
225: 2342| [45] ["Sm... smoke..."]
226: 2350| [47] [Nagisa]
227: 2353| [45] ["I think there's a fire somewhere...!"]
228: 2366| [45] [Upon hearing that, Jun suddenly noticed.]
229: 2371| [45] [Without her realizing it, their surroundings had become enshrouded by the burning stench of smoke.]
230: 2376| [45] [--No, that wasn't all.]
231: 2381| [45] [The debris weighing on her back was starting to get hotter and hotter.]
232: 2386| [47] [Jun]
233: 2387| [45] [(It... it burns!)]
234: 2392| [45] [The debris crushing Jun was on fire. That was the source of the heat and stench.]
235: 2397| [45] [Fear instantly ran through her.]
236: 2402| [47] [Jun]
237: 2403| [45] [(Th-this is bad! My back's gonna get burned--!)]
238: 2429| [45] [Jun instinctively twisted her body.]
239: 2457| [45] [Right at that moment, the debris collapsed, and something searing hot landed on her back.]
240: 2537| [47] [Jun]
241: 2540| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!"]
242: 2548| [47] [Nagisa]
243: 2551| [45] ["J-Jun!?"]
244: 2625| [47] [Jun]
245: 2628| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAH! It burns! It burns! It burns!! Igh, ghhiii, AAAAAAAAAAAGH!"]
246: 2633| [45] [It seemed a scorching hot reinforcing bar or something like that was pressing against her back.]
247: 2638| [45] [It instantly burned through Jun's clothes and charred her skin.]
248: 2643| [45] [Jun gritted her teeth and twisted her body, managing to get the rebar off her back somehow.]
249: 2648| [45] [However, the heat and torturous pain didn't go away.]
250: 2665| [47] [Jun]
251: 2668| [45] ["Haah, haah, haaah...!"]
252: 2676| [47] [Nagisa]
253: 2679| [45] ["A-are you okay...?"]
254: 2687| [47] [Jun]
255: 2690| [45] ["I'm okay... don't worry..."]
256: 2695| [45] [Thoughts ran through Jun's mind as she panted heavily.]
257: 2700| [45] [Now that the small room was on fire, help needed to get there, and fast. If it didn't--%Nthen she and Nagisa were both dead.]
258: 2708| [47] [Jun]
259: 2711| [45] ["S... someone!! Someone help us!!"]
260: 2719| [47] [Jun]
261: 2722| [45] ["Two of us are still trapped here!"]
262: 2727| [45] [Jun hoarsely screamed those words.]
263: 2732| [45] [Nagisa also weakly rose her voice.]
264: 2740| [47] [Nagisa]
265: 2743| [45] ["S-someone..."]
266: 2751| [47] [Nagisa]
267: 2754| [45] [{He... help us...}]
268: 2762| [47] [Jun]
269: 2765| [45] ["Two of us are trapped here!"]
270: 2773| [47] [Nagisa]
271: 2776| [45] [{We're... in apartment 303...}]
272: 2784| [47] [Nagisa]
273: 2787| [45] [{Hurry... the fire's...}]
274: 2795| [47] [Jun]
275: 2798| [45] ["The fire's getting close! Someone--"]
276: 2806| [47] [Jun]
277: 2809| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
278: 2814| [45] [Jun then broke out into a violent coughing fit.]
279: 2819| [45] [Though she'd avoided it so far because she'd been pinned to the floor, the fumes finally started flooding into Jun's mouth.]
280: 2827| [47] [Jun]
281: 2830| [45] ["So... someone..."]
282: 2837| [45] [With those final words, Jun started to pass out. However--]
283: 2848| [45] [She heard the sound of the front door opening up.]
284: 2854| [47] [Jun]
285: 2855| [45] [(!?)]
286: 2860| [45] [Jun was taken aback. The sound was then replaced by human voices.]
287: 2874| [47] [Watase]
288: 2877| [45] ["I... I've located a survivor!!"]
289: 2882| [47] [Jun]
290: 2883| [45] [(He... help's finally... here...?)]
291: 2888| [45] [Though she was barely even conscious, Jun turned towards the voice.]
292: 2899| [45] [Just then, the debris blocking her vision was removed, revealing someone's shadow.]
293: 2994| [47] [Watase]
294: 2997| [45] ["Are you okay!?"]
295: 3005| [47] [Jun]
296: 3008| [45] ["Ugh..."]
297: 3013| [45] [Jun couldn't answer.]
298: 3018| [45] [But the man gave her a reassuring smile.]
299: 3103| [47] [Watase]
300: 3106| [45] ["You did such a good job hanging in there. But you're safe now."]
301: 3111| [47] [Jun]
302: 3112| [45] ["..."]
303: 3117| [45] [Jun managed to give him a faint smile of her own.]
304: 3122| [45] [The man had showed up to save Jun and Nagisa just in the nick of time-- like he was some sort of hero straight out of a movie or something.]
305: 3127| [45] [She heard another man's voice coming from the corner of the room.]
306: 3132| [47] [Dojima]
307: 3135| [45] ["There's another one over here!"]
308: 3143| [47] [Watase]
309: 3146| [45] ["Good! Two survivors secured!"]
310: 3154| [47] [Watase]
311: 3157| [45] ["Hey missy, is there anyone else in this place!?"]
312: 3165| [47] [Jun]
313: 3168| [45] ["N... no... just me... and... Nagisa..."]
314: 3176| [47] [Watase]
315: 3179| [45] ["Thanks! Then just hold on, I'll get you out of there on the double!"]
316: 3225| [45] [The man shouted that, then moved the debris on Jun's back aside--]
317: 3231| [45] [And a second later, he pulled Jun out. She had been saved.]
318: 3349| [45] [The man carried Jun down the creaking hallway.]
319: 3354| [45] [She could see another man a short distance behind them carrying Nagisa.]
320: 3362| [47] [Jun]
321: 3365| [45] ["I... is Nagisa... okay...?"]
322: 3392| [47] [Watase]
323: 3395| [45] ["Nagisa? You mean that other girl?"]
324: 3403| [47] [Jun]
325: 3406| [45] ["Yeah... she's my... sister..."]
326: 3433| [47] [Watase]
327: 3436| [45] ["!? Your sister?"]
328: 3441| [45] [The man behind them then answered Jun's question.]
329: 3446| [47] [Dojima]
330: 3449| [45] ["Don't you worry, missy. Nagisa's safe and sound."]
331: 3454| [47] [Dojima]
332: 3457| [45] ["She's unconscious right now, but her life shouldn't be in any danger."]
333: 3484| [47] [Watase]
334: 3487| [45] ["... See? You don't have to worry."]
335: 3495| [47] [Jun]
336: 3498| [45] ["I see..."]
337: 3503| [45] [At that moment, she suddenly felt her throat hurting from all the smoke she'd been inhaling just minutes ago.]
338: 3511| [47] [Jun]
339: 3514| [45] ["Ugh... *cough* *cough*..."]
340: 3541| [47] [Watase]
341: 3544| [45] ["Are you okay!? I'm gonna get you to a safe place soon, so just hold on tight!"]
342: 3552| [47] [Jun]
343: 3555| [45] ["B-but... it hurts..."]
344: 3563| [47] [Jun]
345: 3566| [45] ["My back... my head... my eyes... they all hurt so much..."]
346: 3574| [47] [Jun]
347: 3577| [45] ["Am I... gonna die...?"]
348: 3582| [45] [Now that she'd confirmed Nagisa was safe, she suddenly felt so weak.]
349: 3587| [45] [But the man answered her in an encouraging voice.]
350: 3614| [47] [Watase]
351: 3617| [45] ["No, don't you worry. I'll never let you die. Never."]
352: 3625| [47] [Jun]
353: 3628| [45] ["Huh...?"]
354: 3655| [47] [Watase]
355: 3658| [45] ["We're rescue workers. We came to save you guys."]
356: 3666| [47] [Watase]
357: 3669| [45] ["We won't let you die now that we're here."]
358: 3674| [47] [Jun]
359: 3675| [45] [(Rescue workers...?)]
360: 3680| [45] [Now that she thought about it, she had heard of them before.]
361: 3685| [45] [She'd learned somewhere that there were firefighters in the city who specialized at saving people's lives.]
362: 3715| [47] [Jun]
363: 3716| [45] [(... I see, so that's... how they were able to save us like it was nothing...)]
364: 3721| [47] [Jun]
365: 3722| [45] [(Rescue workers are real amazing...)]
366: 3727| [47] [Jun]
367: 3728| [45] [(If I had that kind of strength too... I could have helped Nagisa sooner...)]
368: 3790| [45] [And with that thought--]
369: 3795| [45] [Jun once again lost consciousness.]
