  2:   58| [45] [(--I can't do it! There's just no way it can be done!)]
  3:   63| [45] [Watase turned his back on the room.]
  4:  115| [45] [But just as he was about to leave--]
  5:  509| [45] [Five faces flashed through his mind.]
  6:  514| [47] [Watase]
  7:  515| [45] [(... Goddammit!)]
  8:  520| [45] [Watase clenched his fists as he stood in that lethal gas.]
  9:  525| [45] [--They needed four more ampules of AD.]
 10:  530| [45] [Four people would be exposed to radiation if he didn't find some quickly.]
 11:  535| [47] [Watase]
 12:  536| [45] [(I don't... I don't want to let anyone die!)]
 13:  541| [45] [He held his ground and turned back.]
 14:  546| [45] [He then ran into the room while cursing himself for his moment of weakness.]
 15:  599| [45] [Watase strained his eyes and looked around as black smoke and raging heat waves assaulted him.]
 16:  697| [45] [Just then, he spotted a medical box in a gap between the flames--!]
 17:  702| [47] [Watase]
 18:  703| [45] [(Is there anything in it!?)]
 19:  708| [45] [Watase ran over to the box and opened it up.]
 20:  717| [45] [Inside were five ampules of AD.]
 21:  722| [47] [Watase]
 22:  723| [45] [(They're here...!)]
 23:  729| [45] [Watase grabbed the box and took it with him.]
 24:  734| [45] [But he then hit his limit.]
 25:  739| [45] [Watase's consciousness started fading from oxygen deprivation.]
 26:  755| [47] [Watase]
 27:  756| [45] [(I... it hurts...!)]
 28:  761| [45] [And then, as his body thirsted for air--]
 29:  766| [45] [The dam within him finally broke down.]
 30:  774| [47] [Watase]
 31:  777| [45] ["--*gasp*"]
 32:  782| [45] [By the time he came to his senses, he was breathing. But a second later--]
 33:  787| [45] [He felt an intense suffocating sensation, like someone had jammed silk floss down his throat.]
 34:  810| [47] [Watase]
 35:  813| [45] ["Gaah... agh... haah...!?"]
 36:  818| [45] [His whole body went rigid in mere moments.]
 37:  823| [45] [His five senses went faint, and his line of sight started blacking out.]
 38:  874| [45] [The words "oxygen-deficient air" crossed his mind.]
 39:  879| [47] [Watase]
 40:  880| [45] [(Let me...)]
 41:  885| [47] [Watase]
 42:  886| [45] [(Let me get this AD to everyone, if nothing else...!)]
 43:  891| [45] [But his body wouldn't move.]
 44:  896| [45] [The flames closed in on him.]
 45: 1031| [47] [Watase]
 46: 1032| [45] [(It's hot... I'm burning...)]
 47: 1037| [47] [Watase]
 48: 1038| [45] [(Someone... help... me...)]
 49: 1043| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1044| [45] [(I... I can't br...--)]
 51: 1049| [45] [--Watase's consciousness then shut off, and before long, vanished completely.]
