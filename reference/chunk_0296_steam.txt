  0:   54| [45] [--With Wataru's death as the trigger, Watase decided to become a rescue worker.]
  1:   59| [45] [A long time had passed since that day.]
  2:   64| [45] [Much like before, Natsuhiko could instinctively tell how much time had passed as if they were his own memories.]
  3:   69| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   70| [45] [(Ah... so it's been seven years since then...)]
  5:   75| [45] [The thing he saw was--]
  6:   80| [45] [A memory of nine years ago, when Watase was 23 years old.]
  7:  139| [45] [--Watase was training his body that morning, just like he did every other day.]
  8:  144| [45] [The sound of him counting his push-ups echoed through the dim room.]
  9:  176| [47] [Watase]
 10:  179| [45] ["... 195, 196, 197..."]
 11:  184| [45] [His breath was calm and orderly, with not a single bit of exhaustion to be found.]
 12:  192| [47] [Watase]
 13:  195| [45] ["... 200."]
 14:  200| [45] [Watase stopped once he'd counted to 200.]
 15:  208| [47] [Watase]
 16:  211| [45] ["Whew..."]
 17:  216| [45] [Watase stood alone in his room, not a bead of sweat on his face.]
 18:  221| [45] [He was living in a small apartment the city had provided him with after he'd lost his old family home.]
 19:  226| [45] [He had been living there for almost seven years.]
 20:  231| [45] [The same apartment he'd lived in through the time he finished up with high school and then moved on to firefighting school.]
 21:  285| [45] [In those seven years, Rokumei City had transformed into a massive research city that revolved around BC research and nuclear power-- to the point where it became a "government designated top secret city".]
 22:  290| [45] [But Watase had no time to feel uncomfortable about the rapid changes happening in the city, much less feel any loneliness.]
 23:  357| [45] [He lived only to fulfill his sister's dreams.]
 24:  373| [45] [He had remodeled his body and tempered his soul to do so... and passed the notoriously difficult rescue worker exam with top marks.]
 25:  378| [45] [A rescue squad was finally established at the Rokumei City Fire Department at almost the exact same time, and so he enlisted in it.]
 26:  385| [45] [--At that moment, the 2 PM alarm rang on his watch.]
 27:  390| [45] [It was almost time for him to go to work.]
 28:  395| [45] [According to Watase's rotation schedule, he started work at 4 PM, but Watase had a personal rule about always showing up to work early.]
 29:  403| [47] [Watase]
 30:  406| [45] ["... Time to go."]
 31:  411| [45] [The one who spoke was no longer the lazy boy who had no purpose in life.]
 32:  471| [45] [The rescue worker with a body and will of iron left his apartment and headed straight for work.]
 33:  522| [45] [He arrived at the fire station.]
 34:  527| [45] [The building he'd once seen with his sister was now Watase's workplace.]
 35:  532| [45] [He'd figured he'd get used to it long ago-- but he still found himself remembering that day from time to time.]
 36:  600| [47] [Wataru]
 37:  603| [45] ["But there's no female rescue workers out there now, huh?"]
 38:  611| [47] [Wataru]
 39:  614| [45] ["If possible, I'd like to be one."]
 40:  663| [47] [Watase]
 41:  664| [45] [(... Tch.)]
 42:  669| [45] [Watase's heart throbbed painfully at the memory of her voice.]
 43:  674| [47] [Watase]
 44:  675| [45] [(Maybe Wataru is the one who's really working here, not me...)]
 45:  680| [45] [He couldn't exactly keep himself from feeling any hatred for the culprit.]
 46:  685| [45] [But it was much healthier for him to live for the dead than to live by hating others.]
 47:  692| [45] [Just as Watase stood thinking to himself,]
 48:  709| [45] [an ear-piercing siren suddenly interrupted his thoughts.]
 49:  714| [47] [Watase]
 50:  715| [45] [(--A dispatch!)]
 51:  720| [45] [He instantly set his thoughts aside as he focused his mind and honed his senses.]
 52:  726| [45] [His coworkers and the guys on the night shift rapidly dispersed out of the station.]
 53:  731| [45] [The commander noticed Watase and called out to him from afar.]
 54:  736| [47] [Commander]
 55:  739| [45] ["Kasasagi!! Good timing, we're heading out right now!!"]
 56:  747| [47] [Watase]
 57:  750| [45] ["What's the dispatch for!?"]
 58:  755| [47] [Commander]
 59:  758| [45] ["There was a gas explosion at that apartment over there!"]
 60:  765| [45] [Watase jumped onto the fire truck as soon as he heard that.]
 61:  829| [45] [--He listened to the radio report inside the truck as he changed into his uniform.]
 62:  834| [47] [Operator]
 63:  837| [45] ["A large-scale gas explosion accident has occurred at the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex at 2-4 Higashi-machi."]
 64:  842| [47] [Operator]
 65:  845| [45] ["There are residents still inside, though the exact number is uncertain."]
 66:  850| [47] [Operator]
 67:  853| [45] ["Furthermore, there is a possibility that the building will cave in or collapse entirely."]
 68:  858| [47] [Operator]
 69:  861| [45] ["Firefighting squads and the elite rescue squad are to hurry to the scene and conduct firefighting and rescue efforts."]
 70:  866| [45] [The truck arrived at the scene just as the radio transmission ended.]
 71:  944| [47] [Watase]
 72:  947| [45] ["Damn, this is bad...!"]
 73:  959| [45] [Thick clouds of black smoke rose from the now burning apartment complex.]
 74:  964| [45] [The commander swiftly gave out orders to the squad members..]
 75:  975| [47] [Commander]
 76:  978| [45] ["The explosion occured from floors 1 to 4 on the building's east side."]
 77:  983| [47] [Commander]
 78:  986| [45] ["As such, there is a high risk of that side collapsing. That is where we will be conducting our rescue efforts."]
 79:  991| [47] [Commander]
 80:  994| [45] ["Team A will split into two groups: Kasasagi and Dojima will take the 6th floor, while Hiyama and Matsuzawa take the 5th floor."]
 81:  999| [47] [Commander]
 82: 1002| [45] ["Likewise, Team B will also split into two groups: Asukai and Okamura will take floors 4 and 3, while Hashino and Iida will take floors 2 and 1."]
 83: 1007| [47] [Commander]
 84: 1010| [45] ["Remember, we're trying to save lives here. Make sure you don't leave a single person behind. Ask your team captains for specific instructions."]
 85: 1015| [47] [Commander]
 86: 1018| [45] ["All right then, get to work, men!"]
 87: 1026| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1029| [45] ["Sir, yes sir!!"]
 89: 1041| [45] [The rescue workers then proceeded to run into the apartment complex.]
 90: 1091| [45] [Watase and his partner Dojima went around checking all the rooms on the 6th floor.]
 91: 1096| [45] [There were many doors they couldn't open, likely due to the explosion--]
 92: 1101| [45] [But they just broke down those doors, saved all the people inside, and continued their rescue efforts in a show of supreme skill.]
 93: 1152| [45] [--Just when they finished checking all the rooms--]
 94: 1179| [45] [The walkway began to slant.]
 95: 1187| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1190| [45] ["It's collapsing!?"]
 97: 1195| [47] [Dojima]
 98: 1198| [45] ["Crap! Kasasagi, let's pull out!"]
 99: 1203| [45] [Dojima shouted that to him from behind.]
100: 1208| [45] [They'd already completely evacuated the floor they'd been assigned to, so they were positive they hadn't left anyone behind.]
101: 1213| [45] [But as Watase and Dojima started fleeing--]
102: 1218| [45] [A voice called out.]
103: 1275| [85] [{He... help us...}]
104: 1276| [86] [???]
105: 1277| [86] [{He... help us...}]
106: 1323| [47] [Watase]
107: 1326| [45] ["!!"]
108: 1331| [45] [Watase stopped dead in his tracks.]
109: 1336| [47] [Dojima]
110: 1339| [45] ["Kasasagi, what's wrong!?"]
111: 1347| [47] [Watase]
112: 1350| [45] ["I thought I just heard a voice...!"]
113: 1363| [45] [He didn't know where it was coming from.]
114: 1368| [45] [But he heard it again.]
115: 1425| [85] [{We're... in apartment 303...}]
116: 1426| [86] [???]
117: 1427| [86] [{We're... in apartment 303...}]
118: 1442| [85] [{Hurry... the fire's...}]
119: 1443| [86] [???]
120: 1444| [86] [{Hurry... the fire's...}]
121: 1472| [45] [It was feeble and only came out in fragments, but it was definitely the voice of someone seeking help.]
122: 1477| [47] [Watase]
123: 1478| [45] [(That'd be the 3rd floor! Did they not search all the rooms down there!?)]
124: 1486| [47] [Watase]
125: 1489| [45] ["Dojima, did you hear that!? There's still someone in apartment 303!"]
126: 1494| [47] [Dojima]
127: 1497| [45] ["Yeah! Let's go save them!"]
128: 1551| [45] [Watase and Dojima proceeded to rush down the stairs.]
129: 1556| [45] [--They encountered a woman who lived there on their way and forced her to evacuate, then headed for apartment 303.]
130: 1626| [45] [They kicked down the warped door and found themselves in a room whose ceiling had collapsed.]
131: 1631| [45] [Flames flickered in that dim space.]
132: 1636| [47] [Watase]
133: 1637| [45] [(Where's the survivor!?)]
134: 1642| [45] [Watase looked all around the room--]
135: 1647| [45] [--and spotted a girl lying trapped under burning debris.]
136: 1667| [47] [Watase]
137: 1668| [45] [(!!)]
138: 1673| [45] [Watase's heart leapt as the sight of that girl momentarily overlapped with Wataru's death in his mind.]
139: 1681| [47] [Watase]
140: 1684| [45] ["I... I've located a survivor!!"]
141: 1690| [45] [Watase ran over to the girl and pulled her out of the rubble.]
142: 1698| [47] [Watase]
143: 1701| [45] ["Are you okay!?"]
144: 1709| [47] [Girl]
145: 1712| [45] ["Ugh..."]
146: 1717| [45] [The girl moaned in pain.]
147: 1722| [45] [She was apparently barely conscious from the lack of oxygen, but she was indeed still alive.]
148: 1727| [45] [Dojima's voice suddenly called out to him.]
149: 1732| [47] [Dojima]
150: 1735| [45] ["There's another one over here!"]
151: 1740| [45] [--The survivors were two girls.]
152: 1745| [45] [Watase and Dojima each took one of the girls and ran out of the room.]
153: 1803| [45] [Watase walked through the creaking hallway as he carried the girl he'd found.]
154: 1808| [45] [Dojima was a short distance behind him, carrying the other girl.]
155: 1813| [45] [The girl Watase was holding soon broke out into a pained coughing fit.]
156: 1874| [47] [Girl]
157: 1877| [45] ["Ugh... *cough* *cough*..."]
158: 1885| [47] [Watase]
159: 1888| [45] ["Are you okay!? I'm gonna get you to a safe place soon, so just hold on tight!"]
160: 1896| [47] [Girl]
161: 1899| [45] ["B-but... it hurts..."]
162: 1907| [47] [Girl]
163: 1910| [45] ["My back... my head... my eyes... they all hurt so much..."]
164: 1918| [47] [Girl]
165: 1921| [45] ["Am I... gonna die...?"]
166: 1926| [45] [Watase answered her tearful question in a clear voice.]
167: 1934| [47] [Watase]
168: 1937| [45] ["No, don't you worry. I'll never let you die. Never."]
169: 1984| [47] [Girl]
170: 1987| [45] ["Huh...?"]
171: 1995| [47] [Watase]
172: 1998| [45] ["We're rescue workers. We came to save you guys."]
173: 2006| [47] [Watase]
174: 2009| [45] ["We won't let you die now that we're here."]
175: 2014| [45] [Watase said that as if to convince himself of that.]
176: 2019| [47] [Watase]
177: 2020| [45] [(... Yeah, isn't that right, Wataru?)]
178: 2025| [47] [Watase]
179: 2026| [45] [(A rescue worker's job is to protect others' futures.)]
180: 2031| [47] [Watase]
181: 2032| [45] [(So there's no way in hell... I can let this little girl die!)]
182: 2037| [45] [Watase walked down the hallway as he thought that.]
183: 2042| [45] [All while carrying that small life on his back.]
184: 2099| [45] [--Watase and Dojima soon safely escaped the apartment and successfully rescued the girls.]
185: 2104| [45] [They were both badly hurt, but it appeared their lives were most likely not in any danger.]
186: 2121| [45] [The girls were put into an ambulance and taken away to the hospital.]
187: 2126| [45] [Watase watched the ambulance drive off.]
188: 2131| [47] [Watase]
189: 2132| [45] [(... Hey, were you watching me?)]
190: 2137| [47] [Watase]
191: 2138| [45] [(I protected those girls' futures.)]
192: 2143| [47] [Watase]
193: 2144| [45] [(Do you think... I've matured a little since those days?)]
194: 2149| [45] [Watase felt like he could hear a nostalgic voice when he thought that.]
195: 2206| [85] [{--You've done so well, Watase.}]
196: 2207| [86] [???]
197: 2208| [86] [{--You've done so well, Watase.}]
198: 2223| [85] [{You've made your big sis proud of you.}]
199: 2224| [86] [???]
200: 2225| [86] [{You've made your big sis proud of you.}]
201: 2268| [47] [Watase]
202: 2269| [45] [(...!)]
203: 2274| [45] [It was probably just a figment of his imagination.]
204: 2279| [45] [But Watase looked up to the heavens and gave that voice a smile.]
