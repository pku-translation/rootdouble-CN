  1:   62| [45] [Watase explained the bomb situation to Natsuhiko and the others.]
  2:   67| [45] [Why disarming it was impossible, and why the lockdown end time had lagged.]
  3:   72| [45] [And how at this rate, everyone would die in the explosion--!]
  4:  119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  122| [45] ["Wh... what do we do!?"]
  6:  148| [47] [Watase]
  7:  151| [45] ["That's what I'd like us to think about. Is there anything we can do to survive...?"]
  8:  177| [47] [Watase]
  9:  180| [45] ["Please, everybody, lend us your wisdom!"]
 10:  185| [45] [Everyone's faces froze at that statement.]
 11:  190| [45] [--Only about 20 minutes remained until detonation.]
 12:  195| [45] [The nine survivors wracked their brains to come up with a way to survive together.]
 13:  203| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  206| [45] ["All nine of us can move..."]
 15:  232| [47] [Watase]
 16:  235| [45] ["But we pretty much have nothing left that can bring about any major change to the current situation."]
 17:  264| [45] [Watase picked up the gun Kazami had dropped earlier.]
 18:  290| [47] [Watase]
 19:  293| [45] ["Even though we can kill each other with this thing... it has no survival usage whatsoever."]
 20:  298| [45] [Watase put away the gun in his pocket as he said that.]
 21:  324| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  327| [45] ["The only other usable things we have are the engine cutter... and at best, the air jack, right?"]
 23:  353| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  356| [45] ["I don't think either of those things will be of use now, though..."]
 25:  410| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  413| [45] ["B-but we can't give up!"]
 27:  421| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  424| [45] ["If we can't do something about the bomb, then let's all look for a way to escape!"]
 29:  478| [47] [Ena]
 30:  481| [45] ["I don't think it'll be easy... Can we really find something in just 20 minutes that we couldn't after six hours...?"]
 31:  535| [47] [Jun]
 32:  538| [45] ["Then could we hack into Brain Cell again and open the bulkheads!?"]
 33:  546| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  549| [45] ["When we stole root authority, it activated something called a 'reactive barrier' which took out Alice Number 2."]
 35:  557| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  560| [45] ["The hacking software my mother prepared for us isn't usable anymore, is it?"]
 37:  614| [47] [Yuuri]
 38:  617| [45] ["But can we try just to make sure...?"]
 39:  625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  628| [45] ["... Worth a shot, I guess."]
 41:  682| [45] [And so the survivors moved to the control room for the time being.]
 42:  811| [45] [There, they connected Alice Number 2 to Brain Cell.]
 43:  816| [45] [But of course, Brain Cell showed no reaction whatsoever.]
 44:  833| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  836| [45] ["So it really was a one-time chance...!"]
 46:  841| [45] [Once Natsuhiko said that, Salyu murmured softly.]
 47:  921| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  924| [45] ["Alice..."]
 49:  932| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  935| [45] ["There's still Alice Number 1."]
 51:  943| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  946| [45] ["Huh?"]
 53:  972| [47] [Salyu]
 54:  975| [45] ["Dr. Tenkawa installed various software onto Alice."]
 55:  983| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  986| [45] ["Even software whose purposes remain unknown to me."]
 57: 1012| [47] [Salyu]
 58: 1015| [45] ["It might include the hacking software..."]
 59: 1097| [45] [Without waiting for the others' response, Salyu connected Alice Number 1 to Brain Cell.]
 60: 1157| [45] [And then the three control terminals--]
 61: 1201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1204| [45] ["Ah...!"]
 63: 1209| [45] [--each displayed the authentication screens.]
 64: 1217| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1220| [45] ["L-looks like it'll work!"]
 66: 1263| [47] [Mashiro]
 67: 1266| [45] ["But are you sure, Salyu!? If you use her to hack, then she'll break too, you know!?"]
 68: 1292| [47] [Salyu]
 69: 1295| [45] ["... Of course it's painful for me."]
 70: 1303| [47] [Salyu]
 71: 1306| [45] ["Because Alice is a part of me..."]
 72: 1332| [47] [Salyu]
 73: 1335| [45] ["But it'd be even more painful if everyone died."]
 74: 1361| [47] [Salyu]
 75: 1364| [45] ["If we get out of here, we can always repair Alice. As long as we live, she can be fixed eventually."]
 76: 1372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1375| [45] ["Yeah... you're right."]
 78: 1433| [45] [Everyone looked glad at those words, but then--]
 79: 1459| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1462| [45] ["No, wait a second!"]
 81: 1470| [47] [Ukita]
 82: 1473| [45] ["Even if we steal root authority and open up the bulkheads, Brain Cell will automatically declare another Case N after 30 seconds!"]
 83: 1481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1484| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 85: 1510| [47] [Ukita]
 86: 1513| [45] ["Everyone, look at that!"]
 87: 1548| [45] [Ukita pointed at the indicator on the monitor labeled "Area N Energy Level".]
 88: 1553| [45] [The value read "1539 mSv"...]
 89: 1581| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1584| [45] ["A Case N is declared under the conditions of 'Area N's WX particle energy levels exceeding 1 mSv'..."]
 91: 1592| [47] [Ukita]
 92: 1595| [45] ["And 'a test subject leaving either Area N or Area 5'."]
 93: 1621| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1624| [45] ["We can't get everyone out of here without violating those conditions...!"]
 95: 1629| [45] [Ukita's bitter voice shocked the others.]
 96: 1637| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1640| [45] ["So you mean it's like this...!?"]
 98: 1648| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1651| [45] ["Even if we open the bulkheads, they'll close again after 30 seconds?"]
100: 1677| [47] [Watase]
101: 1680| [45] ["And opening the bulkheads in the first place requires three people--..."]
102: 1706| [47] [Watase]
103: 1709| [45] ["So for six people to escape... three have to stay down here, huh."]
104: 1767| [47] [All]
105: 1770| [45] ["...!"]
106: 1775| [45] [Everyone gasped at those words.]
107: 1780| [45] [That was the answer thrust before them.]
108: 1785| [45] ["Three people must remain in the control room to steal root authority from Brain Cell and force the bulkheads open."]
109: 1790| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1791| [45] [(At the very least, that means six people can escape before the explosion...!)]
111: 1796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1797| [45] [(But that also means... that the other three need to die!)]
113: 1802| [45] [The question once thrust upon Watase was now thrust upon the others.]
114: 1937| [45] [When Watase found the thirty AD ampules in Miyoko Tenkawa's office, he had thought to himself:]
115: 1942| [45] ["Only six of the nine could survive."]
116: 1947| [45] ["9-3=6"-- that equation bound them once again.]
117: 1996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1997| [45] [(Then which three do we choose...!?)]
119: 2002| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2003| [45] [(Which six get to survive!?)]
121: 2008| [45] [The nine people in the room established emotional bonds through all their shared experiences.]
122: 2013| [45] [Even if their principles and perspectives differed, not a single one of them genuinely wished for any of the others to die.]
123: 2018| [45] [It was just too sad to decide who had to stay.]
124: 2023| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 2024| [45] [(Even if Watase or I sacrifice ourselves... that won't solve everything.)]
126: 2029| [45] [Just like how Natsuhiko tried to break Mashiro out of there through the cargo lift,]
127: 2034| [45] [and how Watase went off to extinguish the fires in Area N,]
128: 2039| [45] [they didn't even have the option to "save everyone in exchange for their own lives".]
129: 2044| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 2045| [45] [(... But still...)]
131: 2050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2051| [45] [(We still have to make a decision...!)]
133: 2056| [45] [They were all probably thinking the same thing.]
134: 2061| [45] [A hopeless silence engulfed the room.]
135: 2066| [45] [--Eventually, a girl whispered an answer in Natsuhiko's ear.]
136: 2094| [47] [Yuuri]
137: 2097| [45] ["Th... the answer's obvious, isn't it?"]
138: 2105| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 2108| [45] ["Huh?"]
140: 2134| [47] [Yuuri]
141: 2137| [45] ["The answer is 'we leave nobody behind'."]
142: 2145| [47] [Yuuri]
143: 2148| [45] ["'We bring everybody to the bulkheads'...!"]
144: 2153| [45] [Yuuri looked at everyone as she said that.]
145: 2179| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 2182| [45] ["Right? Isn't that right, guys!?"]
147: 2208| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2211| [45] ["The bomb's set in Area Zero, isn't it? It's in such a deep place."]
149: 2237| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 2240| [45] ["So the shockwave might not reach all the way to the bulkheads, right?"]
151: 2248| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2251| [45] ["Let's all pray for that and wait for the bulkheads to open by themselves!"]
153: 2278| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 2281| [45] ["Y-you're right...! That's a good idea, Yuuri!"]
155: 2312| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 2315| [45] ["How can I survive if it means sacrificing someone else...?"]
157: 2341| [47] [Yuuri]
158: 2344| [45] ["Right!?"]
159: 2349| [45] [Mashiro approved of Yuuri's opinion.]
160: 2354| [45] [Even in this dire situation, the two girls never forgot kindness.]
161: 2414| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 2415| [45] [(But that kindness... won't help right now.)]
163: 2420| [45] [Watase spoke Natsuhiko's thoughts for him.]
164: 2446| [47] [Watase]
165: 2449| [45] ["... You two really are kind..."]
166: 2475| [47] [Watase]
167: 2478| [45] ["But we can't do that."]
168: 2504| [47] [Mashiro]
169: 2507| [45] ["Huh!?"]
170: 2533| [47] [Watase]
171: 2536| [45] ["If anyone's going to wait in front of the bulkheads, it'd be better for it to be the three left behind after the other six escape, right?"]
172: 2562| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 2565| [45] ["B-but! Who's going to be left behind--"]
174: 2591| [47] [Watase]
175: 2594| [45] ["That's what we need to decide."]
176: 2620| [47] [Watase]
177: 2623| [45] ["At the very least, I'm staying."]
178: 2661| [45] [Kazami and Jun's eyes widened at those words.]
179: 2687| [47] [Jun]
180: 2690| [45] ["Captain, you can't be serious!"]
181: 2716| [47] [Watase]
182: 2719| [45] ["Oh come on, it's should be an obvious choice, right? After all, I'm the one who set the bomb up in the first place."]
183: 2745| [47] [Kazami]
184: 2748| [45] ["There you go showing off again...!"]
185: 2774| [47] [Kazami]
186: 2777| [45] ["Only a fool throws away their own life to save others! Isn't that right!?"]
187: 2803| [47] [Watase]
188: 2806| [45] ["Exactly. And I'm an utter fool for resorting to terrorism."]
189: 2832| [47] [Watase]
190: 2835| [45] ["So I want to be the one to clean up after my own mess."]
191: 2896| [47] [Kazami]
192: 2899| [45] ["..."]
193: 2925| [47] [Watase]
194: 2928| [45] ["So we only need two others. Two people to stay underground with me..."]
195: 2954| [47] [Jun]
196: 2957| [45] ["Two others...!?"]
197: 2962| [45] [Jun murmured that, and then fell silent.]
198: 2967| [45] [Then after a brief pause-- she spoke up resolutely.]
199: 2993| [47] [Jun]
200: 2996| [45] ["... Just two more, huh."]
201: 3022| [47] [Jun]
202: 3025| [45] ["Okay, I got it...!"]
203: 3030| [45] [Jun looked at Kazami with clouded eyes.]
204: 3056| [47] [Jun]
205: 3059| [45] ["Let's stay behind, Sis."]
206: 3067| [47] [Jun]
207: 3070| [45] ["Us three members of Sirius will stay...!"]
208: 3111| [47] [Watase]
209: 3114| [45] ["Wh... what!?"]
210: 3122| [47] [Kazami]
211: 3125| [45] ["W-wait, Jun!?"]
212: 3151| [47] [Kazami]
213: 3154| [45] ["I'm fine with staying, but why you too!?"]
214: 3180| [47] [Jun]
215: 3183| [45] ["Because if you and the captain stay behind, that's still not enough people."]
216: 3191| [47] [Jun]
217: 3194| [45] ["It's our job to save lives."]
218: 3220| [47] [Jun]
219: 3223| [45] ["And if doing so requires sacrifices no matter what... then we have no choice, do we?"]
220: 3249| [47] [Kazami]
221: 3252| [45] ["Th-that might be true, but still...!"]
222: 3257| [45] [Kazami reluctantly accepted that viewpoint.]
223: 3262| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3263| [45] [(That's our first option...!)]
225: 3268| [45] [Option: The rescue squad (Watase, Kazami, Jun) would stay.]
226: 3351| [45] [But then Ukita cut in.]
227: 3384| [47] [Ukita]
228: 3387| [45] ["W... wait! If someone has to stay, then it shall be me!"]
229: 3413| [47] [Jun]
230: 3416| [45] ["You, Mr. Ukita!?"]
231: 3424| [47] [Ukita]
232: 3427| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi and I are the ones at fault. If Captain Kasasagi's going to stay, then it only makes sense for me to stay as well!"]
233: 3453| [47] [Kazami]
234: 3456| [45] ["Y-you can't, Mr. Ukita!"]
235: 3482| [47] [Kazami]
236: 3485| [45] ["I can't accept that! Regardless of the circumstances, you're still a 'survivor' under our custody!"]
237: 3511| [47] [Watase]
238: 3514| [45] ["No, the old man's right! Me, the old man, and one other person will stay behind!"]
239: 3647| [45] [--"Watase, Ukita, and one other person".]
240: 3652| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko heard those words, he spoke without thinking.]
241: 3660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 3663| [45] ["Th... then I should stay too!"]
243: 3704| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 3707| [45] ["Huh!?"]
245: 3712| [45] [Yuuri and the others gasped at Natsuhiko's suggestion.]
246: 3738| [47] [Mashiro]
247: 3741| [45] ["Wh-why you, Natsuhiko!?"]
248: 3749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 3752| [45] ["... If the ones at fault are staying, then I'll stay. I'm responsible for this too."]
250: 3760| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 3763| [45] ["The end of the lockdown got delayed because of my BC...!"]
252: 3786| [45] [And thus, out of his own volition, Natsuhiko came up with the second option.]
253: 3791| [45] [Option: The ones at fault (Natsuhiko, Watase, Ukita) would stay.]
254: 3796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3797| [45] [(Of course, I don't want to choose that option myself... and Yuuri and the others don't seem to agree with it either, but...)]
256: 3802| [45] [Just as Natsuhiko had predicted, Mashiro and the others spoke up in opposition.]
257: 3828| [47] [Mashiro]
258: 3831| [45] ["Natsuhiko, what are you talking about!? That's no reason for you to stay behind!"]
259: 3859| [47] [Salyu]
260: 3862| [45] ["I agree... If that's enough to make you 'at fault' here, then every single one of us is at fault."]
261: 3888| [47] [Yuuri]
262: 3891| [45] ["Th-that's right, Hikorin... there's no need for you to stay behind."]
263: 3899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 3902| [45] ["But... in that case, who should stay, then...?"]
265: 3928| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 3931| [45] ["..."]
267: 3936| [45] [The question silenced Yuuri for a moment-- but eventually, she answered resolutely.]
268: 3962| [47] [Yuuri]
269: 3965| [45] ["... You're right... If Captain Kasasagi, Mr. Ukita, and one more person have to stay..."]
270: 3991| [47] [Yuuri]
271: 3994| [45] ["Th-then... I guess I have to..."]
272: 4035| [47] [Mashiro]
273: 4038| [45] ["N-no, Yuuri! That doesn't make sense either!"]
274: 4064| [47] [Yuuri]
275: 4067| [45] ["I-I know it doesn't!"]
276: 4093| [47] [Yuuri]
277: 4096| [45] ["But then what are we supposed to do otherwise, Mashiron!?"]
278: 4122| [47] [Yuuri]
279: 4125| [45] ["Even if Captain Kasasagi and Mr. Ukita stay behind, one other person has to do so as well, right!?"]
280: 4151| [47] [Mashiro]
281: 4154| [45] ["No... please don't say that, Yuuri!"]
282: 4180| [47] [Mashiro]
283: 4183| [45] ["Why do you always have to be the one to suffer!?"]
284: 4191| [47] [Mashiro]
285: 4194| [45] ["Are you telling me to live with guilt again!? How long will this have to continue!?"]
286: 4220| [47] [Mashiro]
287: 4223| [45] ["If you say you're going to stay, Yuuri, then it's better that I stay instead!"]
288: 4249| [47] [Yuuri]
289: 4252| [45] ["...!"]
290: 4278| [47] [Salyu]
291: 4281| [45] ["N-no fighting. I thought you were best friends."]
292: 4307| [47] [Mashiro]
293: 4310| [45] ["But Salyu! I can't just let Yuuri die--"]
294: 4336| [47] [Salyu]
295: 4339| [45] ["Then are you saying you'll stay instead, Mashiro? I don't want you to die either. Will you stay regardless?"]
296: 4365| [47] [Mashiro]
297: 4368| [45] ["Aah...!"]
298: 4394| [47] [Salyu]
299: 4397| [45] ["But then again, I can't say 'I'll stay behind instead of you two' either."]
300: 4423| [47] [Salyu]
301: 4426| [45] ["... I don't want to die."]
302: 4452| [47] [Salyu]
303: 4455| [45] ["I met everyone and found life fun for the very first time."]
304: 4463| [47] [Salyu]
305: 4466| [45] ["I felt that at last, my real life had only just begun..."]
306: 4492| [47] [Salyu]
307: 4495| [45] ["So I... I want to live more."]
308: 4521| [47] [Mashiro]
309: 4524| [45] ["S-Salyu...!"]
310: 4529| [45] [Everyone grew silent as Salyu squeezed out her honest feelings from the bottom of her heart.]
311: 4555| [47] [Salyu]
312: 4558| [45] ["... I'm sorry. I can't be strong like you guys."]
313: 4584| [47] [Yuuri]
314: 4587| [45] ["Th-that's normal... There's nothing for you to apologize about."]
315: 4620| [45] [Ena cut into the conversation.]
316: 4653| [47] [Ena]
317: 4656| [45] ["She's right, Ms. Sannomiya."]
318: 4682| [47] [Ena]
319: 4685| [45] ["It's wrong for children to die for the mistakes of adults."]
320: 4711| [47] [Ena]
321: 4714| [45] ["... That said, to be honest... I don't want to die either."]
322: 4755| [47] [Mashiro]
323: 4758| [45] ["Huh...?"]
324: 4784| [47] [Ena]
325: 4787| [45] ["'I can't just die here in a place like this'-- That thought was what helped me survive up to this point."]
326: 4813| [47] [Ena]
327: 4816| [45] ["I don't think 'I've had enough'. Nor do I think 'I want to die for others'."]
328: 4842| [47] [Ena]
329: 4845| [45] ["It's human nature not to think those things. It's animal instinct...!"]
330: 4850| [45] [As Ena said that, her noble facial features warped tearfully.]
331: 4876| [47] [Ena]
332: 4879| [45] ["But... but you know..."]
333: 4887| [47] [Ena]
334: 4890| [45] ["I'm a teacher, aren't I?"]
335: 4898| [47] [Ena]
336: 4901| [45] ["If the alternative is to sacrifice my own students..."]
337: 4927| [47] [Ena]
338: 4930| [45] ["Then I'd rather stay behind myself...!"]
339: 4953| [45] [Natsuhiko was shocked to hear those unexpected words.]
340: 4961| [47] [Natsuhiko]
341: 4964| [45] ["P-Prof. Tsubakiyama!?"]
342: 4990| [47] [Salyu]
343: 4993| [45] ["What are you saying, Ena!? That makes you the same as Yuuri and the others!"]
344: 5019| [47] [Ena]
345: 5022| [45] ["No I'm not, I just--"]
346: 5048| [47] [Ena]
347: 5051| [45] ["I just think that adults who'd sacrifice children for their own survival are no adults at all."]
348: 5059| [47] [Natsuhiko]
349: 5062| [45] ["Huh...?"]
350: 5088| [47] [Ena]
351: 5091| [45] ["It's adults like that who made this messed up world."]
352: 5117| [47] [Ena]
353: 5120| [45] ["So I just want you kids to know that there are proper adults out there."]
354: 5128| [47] [Ena]
355: 5131| [45] ["There are adults out there who will risk their own lives to save children they do not know.%NEven if it's not to atone. Even if it's not their duty."]
356: 5139| [47] [Ena]
357: 5142| [45] ["If I set that sort of example for you kids, then you won't end up cursing this society, will you?"]
358: 5168| [47] [Ena]
359: 5171| [45] ["I'm sure the next generation-- will bring about a more proper society."]
360: 5179| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 5182| [45] ["..."]
362: 5187| [45] [Those words were most likely a thought that Ena had shut away in the innermost depths of her heart, oozing out just now.]
363: 5192| [45] [She seriously wanted to live.]
364: 5197| [45] [But on the other hand, she wanted to save the children.]
365: 5202| [45] [She was tied up by her own self-preservation instincts and the logic to save others.]
366: 5228| [47] [Salyu]
367: 5231| [45] ["... I just don't know anymore..."]
368: 5257| [47] [Salyu]
369: 5260| [45] ["What do we do...?"]
370: 5265| [45] [Once he heard Salyu say that, Natsuhiko pondered.]
371: 5348| [47] [Natsuhiko]
372: 5349| [45] [(I don't want to let anyone else die, but... Yuuri and the others probably won't accept me staying behind.)]
373: 5354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
374: 5355| [45] [(Dammit! Is there... is there no other option...!?)]
375: 5360| [45] [The moment that though crossed his mind-- Kazami suddenly spoke up.]
376: 5393| [47] [Kazami]
377: 5396| [45] ["Wait... I've realized there's just one more option."]
378: 5404| [47] [Natsuhiko]
379: 5407| [45] ["Huh?"]
380: 5433| [47] [Kazami]
381: 5436| [45] ["I awoke to Senses Sympathy earlier."]
382: 5444| [47] [Kazami]
383: 5447| [45] ["That means three of us out of the nine here are Senses Sympathy users."]
384: 5473| [47] [Kazami]
385: 5476| [45] ["And even if the Senses Sympathy users escaped, we'd be targeted for confinement, wouldn't we?"]
386: 5484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 5487| [45] ["Wh... what are you trying to say, Ms. Tachibana?"]
388: 5514| [47] [Kazami]
389: 5517| [45] ["So in that case, Tenkawa, Ms. Yuuri..."]
390: 5525| [47] [Kazami]
391: 5528| [45] ["If we're just going to be confined anyway, why don't we be the ones to stay behind?"]
392: 5536| [47] [Natsuhiko]
393: 5539| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
394: 5544| [45] [Natsuhiko was driven speechless.]
395: 5549| [45] [For the time being, they had their third option.]
396: 5554| [45] [Option: The Senses Sympathy users would stay.]
397: 5559| [45] [However--]
398: 5567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
399: 5570| [45] ["Are... are you being serious, Ms. Tachibana...!?"]
400: 5597| [47] [Ena]
401: 5600| [45] ["D-did you hear anything I just said!?"]
402: 5608| [47] [Ena]
403: 5611| [45] ["You're free to stay behind and sacrifice yourself if you want, but I'm telling you to leave the children out of it!"]
404: 5640| [47] [Kazami]
405: 5641| [45] ["..."]
406: 5646| [45] [Kazami didn't answer.]
407: 5651| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't understand why she would ever say such a thing.]
408: 5712| [47] [Watase]
409: 5715| [45] ["Whoa, Kazami! Don't say that!"]
410: 5723| [47] [Watase]
411: 5726| [45] ["It's a done deal that I'm staying behind! Don't think of any option that precludes that!"]
412: 5731| [45] [Watase's word ended the discussion.]
413: 5779| [45] [Which left three options in all:]
414: 5832| [45] [1. The rescue workers (Watase, Kazami, Jun) would stay.]
415: 5881| [45] [2. The ones at fault (Natsuhiko, Watase, Ukita) would stay.]
416: 6019| [45] [3. The Senses Sympathy users (Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Kazami) would stay.]
417: 6077| [45] [--Each option was as difficult to choose as the next.]
418: 6091| [47] [Natsuhiko]
419: 6092| [45] [(... Is there no other route to take...?)]
420: 6104| [47] [Natsuhiko]
421: 6105| [45] [(Does somebody have to die...!?)]
422: 6117| [45] [It was almost time to make their decision.]
423: 6129| [45] [The time to decide who to cast away was imminent...!]
424: 6242| [45] [--But Natsuhiko thought to himself--]
425: 6290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
426: 6291| [45] [(... Who do we cast away...?)]
427: 6296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
428: 6297| [45] [(I can't decide that...!)]
429: 6302| [45] [--He couldn't come to a quick decision.]
430: 6307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
431: 6308| [45] [(... I've seen everybody's memories.)]
432: 6313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
433: 6314| [45] [(I've had a glimpse of everyone's lives. I've come to know the emotions they've had...!)]
434: 6319| [45] [He recalled the words he had heard in everyone's memories.]
435: 6388| [47] [Watase]
436: 6391| [45] ["Should I feel ashamed... about wanting revenge...?"]
437: 6417| [47] [Yuuri]
438: 6420| [45] ["Because Hikorin saved me. So now it's my turn."]
439: 6446| [47] [Mashiro]
440: 6449| [45] ["I'm waiting... for you to come back, Natsuhiko..."]
441: 6475| [47] [Ena]
442: 6478| [45] ["So please... I don't care what anyone says. I can't let LABO's crimes pass!"]
443: 6504| [47] [Ukita]
444: 6507| [45] ["But do you believe that robbing the happiness of one to develop the technology to save a million is forgivable?"]
445: 6534| [47] [Salyu]
446: 6537| [45] ["Because my role... is to protect Natsuhiko and the others."]
447: 6564| [47] [Jun]
448: 6567| [45] ["So let's work together, rescue the survivors... then find a way out for sure, okay?"]
449: 6594| [47] [Kazami]
450: 6597| [45] ["Well, if anything -were- to happen, I'd protect you, so don't worry."]
451: 6624| [47] [Yuuri]
452: 6627| [45] ["I'll rewind time for Hikorin, as many times as it takes...!"]
453: 6654| [47] [Watase]
454: 6657| [45] ["I'm going to get these girls out of here!"]
455: 6702| [45] [Everyone had their own convictions.]
456: 6707| [45] [Natsuhiko had learned that by seeing the particulars of their memories.]
457: 6712| [45] [... And that's why he couldn't choose.]
458: 6717| [45] [Even though he may have been able to cast someone away had he known nothing--]
459: 6722| [47] [Natsuhiko]
460: 6723| [45] [(... But...)]
461: 6728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
462: 6729| [45] [(In that case, I want to keep searching to the very end.)]
463: 6734| [47] [Natsuhiko]
464: 6735| [45] [(For a route where nobody has to be cast away!)]
465: 6780| [45] [Natsuhiko made his decision--]
466: 6785| [45] [To stand up against despair.]
467: 6793| [47] [Natsuhiko]
468: 6796| [45] ["I won't let anyone else die..."]
469: 6804| [47] [Natsuhiko]
470: 6807| [45] ["All nine of us will survive together!!"]
