  1:   53| [45] [Natsuhiko hung his head and wracked his brain.]
  2:   58| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   59| [45] [(Can I choose...!?)]
  4:  105| [45] [If it were at all possible, he wanted to fulfill Watase's wishes.]
  5:  110| [45] [They were partners who had once established an emotional bond, after all.]
  6:  115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  116| [45] [(... But I can't just go and do that, can I!?)]
  8:  177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  178| [45] [(Yuuri wasted nine years of her life to save me, didn't she!?)]
 10:  183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  184| [45] [(There's no way in hell I can just hand Yuuri over to Q after she's done all that--...)]
 12:  242| [45] [--As he thought to himself, suddenly--]
 13:  294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  295| [45] [(...--!!)]
 15:  300| [45] [An epiphany struck him like lightning.]
 16:  305| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  306| [45] [(Th-that's it... How did I not think of that...!?)]
 18:  311| [45] [There was but a single way.]
 19:  316| [45] [A single way to both fulfill Watase's demands and save Yuuri at the same time.]
 20:  321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  322| [45] [(That's it! That's the only way...!)]
 22:  327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  328| [45] [(If it means not having to hand Yuuri over, then it's a much better alternative!)]
 24:  434| [45] [--Natsuhiko quietly resolved himself.]
 25:  439| [45] [He looked Watase straight in the eye and spoke.]
 26:  447| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  450| [45] ["Say, Watase..."]
 28:  486| [47] [Watase]
 29:  489| [45] ["... What is it?"]
 30:  525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  528| [45] ["The Communicator that's to accompany you... the Communicator that's to cooperate with Q, that is--"]
 32:  536| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  539| [45] ["--It doesn't have to be Yuuri, does it?"]
 34:  616| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  619| [45] ["!?"]
 36:  624| [45] [Yuuri's eyes widened instantly.]
 37:  629| [45] [She probably understood the meaning behind Natsuhiko's words.]
 38:  655| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  658| [45] ["Hikorin, you don't mean...!?"]
 40:  666| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  669| [45] ["... I do, Yuuri."]
 42:  677| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  680| [45] ["I'm going with Watase in your stead."]
 44:  744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  747| [45] ["Hey Watase, that's okay with you, isn't it?"]
 46:  752| [45] [When Natsuhiko asked that question, Watase responded--]
 47:  788| [47] [Watase]
 48:  791| [45] ["... I can't argue with that."]
 49:  796| [45] [--as such.]
 50:  874| [47] [Watase]
 51:  877| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, don't put yourself through trouble."]
 52:  885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  888| [45] ["... It's not like I chose this route for your sake."]
 54:  896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  899| [45] ["But if it's to help the people precious to me, then--"]
 56:  980| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  983| [45] ["No, Hikorin! You mustn't go with Captain Kasasagi!"]
 58:  988| [45] [Yuuri interrupted Natsuhiko.]
 59: 1019| [47] [Yuuri]
 60: 1022| [45] ["It's not like you want to join Q, do you, Hikorin!? So why...?"]
 61: 1030| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1033| [45] ["... I won't become a terrorist."]
 63: 1041| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1044| [45] ["But Watase's right. There certainly is something wrong with this town."]
 65: 1052| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1055| [45] ["And if someone's gonna right that wrong... then I want to contribute too."]
 67: 1063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1066| [45] ["For the sake of all the precious people that have always been there for me..."]
 69: 1093| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1096| [45] ["But this incident will put Q on the radar of even more organizations!"]
 71: 1104| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1107| [45] ["If you go with Captain Kasasagi, you'll never be able to return to a normal lifestyle! You'll never see everyone again!"]
 73: 1134| [47] [Yuuri]
 74: 1137| [45] ["I don't want that, Hikorin! Don't go!"]
 75: 1142| [45] [But Natsuhiko shook his head and gripped her hand.]
 76: 1150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1153| [45] ["... Yuuri, thank you for being so considerate."]
 78: 1161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1164| [45] ["But you've been saving me continuously these past nine years..."]
 80: 1172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1175| [45] ["So now it's my turn to save you."]
 82: 1202| [47] [Yuuri]
 83: 1205| [45] ["Y-you mean..."]
 84: 1232| [47] [Yuuri]
 85: 1235| [45] ["If you're going, then I'm coming too, Hikorin!"]
 86: 1243| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1246| [45] ["No. It's dangerous."]
 88: 1254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1257| [45] ["You won't be able to see Mashiro, Salyu, or Mom either, you know?"]
 90: 1265| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1268| [45] ["So you can't come with me. I'm going alone."]
 92: 1295| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1298| [45] ["No, Hikorin! I don't want that!"]
 94: 1303| [45] [Yuuri screamed as heavy teardrops rained from her eyes.]
 95: 1308| [45] [She was like a child throwing a tantrum.]
 96: 1316| [47] [Yuuri]
 97: 1319| [45] ["I thought... I thought this time we'd finally be able to be together..."]
 98: 1327| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1330| [45] ["I wanted us... to be together... *sob* ... forever..."]
100: 1338| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1341| [45] ["*sob*... *sniff*..."]
102: 1349| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1352| [45] ["Yuuri... I'm sorry."]
104: 1360| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1363| [45] ["But I'll come back for sure... So it's farewell for now, but just for a little while."]
106: 1371| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1374| [45] ["Goodbye, Yuuri."]
108: 1379| [45] [Natsuhiko whispered that to her...]
109: 1437| [45] [... and then used Senses Sympathy one last time.]
110: 1442| [45] [To erase Yuuri's "current memory" and knock her out.]
111: 1555| [45] [--And at that moment, his field of vision was filled with radiant light.]
112: 1560| [45] [He felt something warm flow through him from the depths of her mind.]
113: 1616| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1619| [45] [{... I'm sorry... for being such a crybaby to the very end...}]
115: 1632| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1635| [45] [{If this is your choice, then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you, huh...}]
117: 1648| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1651| [45] [{But please, Hikorin. Just promise me one thing. Promise to come back, no matter what happens!}]
119: 1727| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1730| [45] [{I'll be waiting for you... I'll be waiting for you to come back, with Mashiron, and Salyu, and the professor too...!}]
121: 1735| [45] [Along with her telepathy came feelings meant to console Natsuhiko.]
122: 1740| [45] [As those feelings enveloped him--]
123: 1811| [45] [Natsuhiko blew Yuuri's memories away.]
