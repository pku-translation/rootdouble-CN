  0:   81| [45] [--It was last night.]
  1:   86| [45] [Yuuri and Dr. Tenkawa were discussing the plans for the "next day", that is, September 16.]
  2:  118| [47] [Yuuri]
  3:  121| [45] ["Professor, about tomorrow's plans..."]
  4:  129| [47] [Miyoko]
  5:  132| [45] ["What is it?"]
  6:  140| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  143| [45] ["It says '6:30 AM - 6:30 PM: Experiments in Area N'. What are we doing there?"]
  8:  169| [47] [Miyoko]
  9:  172| [45] ["Well, properly speaking, there's been this experiment that I've always wanted to conduct..."]
 10:  180| [47] [Miyoko]
 11:  183| [45] ["But it suddenly became necessary to run the experiment right away, so I want your help, Yuuri."]
 12:  191| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  194| [45] ["Why now?"]
 14:  220| [47] [Miyoko]
 15:  223| [45] ["The number of test subjects has decreased after Yui left LABO, correct?"]
 16:  231| [47] [Miyoko]
 17:  234| [45] ["But we still have to prove to the higher ups in LABO that we're conducting advanced experiments."]
 18:  242| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  245| [45] ["I understand. Of course I'll help."]
 20:  253| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  256| [45] ["But what sort of experiment is it?"]
 22:  282| [47] [Miyoko]
 23:  285| [45] ["Let's see, in simple terms--"]
 24:  311| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  314| [45] ["It's an experiment to 'create a consciousness', perhaps."]
 26:  322| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  325| [45] ["...?"]
 28:  330| [45] [While Yuuri blinked in confusion, the professor continued with a straight face.]
 29:  338| [47] [Miyoko]
 30:  341| [45] ["Yuuri, did you know? The process through which a consciousness forms is still not well understood by modern science."]
 31:  349| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  352| [45] ["It isn't?"]
 33:  378| [47] [Miyoko]
 34:  381| [45] ["Logically, the consciousness seems to come forth from somewhere in the brain, correct?"]
 35:  389| [47] [Miyoko]
 36:  392| [45] ["But no matter how thoroughly we analyze the brain, we still don't understand the mechanism through which a consciousness is born."]
 37:  400| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  403| [45] ["How does a simple lump of protein produce a 'consciousness'...? Where exactly is the consciousness?"]
 39:  411| [47] [Yuuri]
 40:  414| [45] ["So is this an experiment to try and find the answer?"]
 41:  440| [47] [Miyoko]
 42:  443| [45] ["No. It's an experiment to verify the answer I've found myself."]
 43:  448| [45] [The professor smiled boldly.]
 44:  474| [47] [Miyoko]
 45:  477| [45] ["Now then, Yuuri. Before we search for the process of consciousness creation, there's something you need to know."]
 46:  485| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  488| [45] ["But first of all, what exactly do you think a 'consciousness' is?"]
 48:  496| [47] [Yuuri]
 49:  499| [45] ["A consciousness? Hmm... that's a hard question..."]
 50:  507| [47] [Yuuri]
 51:  510| [45] ["A mind that thinks and feels... It's what we call a spirit, right?"]
 52:  536| [47] [Miyoko]
 53:  539| [45] ["A spirit, huh. That's another answer."]
 54:  547| [47] [Miyoko]
 55:  550| [45] ["It's a philosophical problem with many answers, but at the very least, this is what I think."]
 56:  576| [47] [Miyoko]
 57:  579| [45] ["A consciousness is 'an accumulation of information' and its 'transformed state'. And it must be capable of 'making decisions' regarding the process of its own transformation."]
 58:  587| [47] [Yuuri]
 59:  590| [45] ["Making decisions...?"]
 60:  616| [47] [Miyoko]
 61:  619| [45] ["That's the key. The dividing line between a simple collection of information and a complex consciousness."]
 62:  627| [47] [Miyoko]
 63:  630| [45] ["A simple accumulation of information won't cause a consciousness to be born."]
 64:  638| [47] [Miyoko]
 65:  641| [45] ["For example, a hard disk won't have a consciousness no matter how high its capacity.%NThe information recorded on it won't transform on its own."]
 66:  649| [47] [Miyoko]
 67:  652| [45] ["So what if that information were to 'transform'? It would still not suffice as a consciousness."]
 68:  660| [47] [Miyoko]
 69:  663| [45] ["If you rewrote a hard disk's contents a thousand times, it would be your work, not the hard disk. That's not a consciousness at all."]
 70:  671| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  674| [45] ["No, not even a computer program counts. Those merely follow predetermined processes.%NIt's not as if they make their own decisions."]
 72:  700| [47] [Miyoko]
 73:  703| [45] ["But-- what if that information was able to decide the process of its own transformation?"]
 74:  726| [47] [Yuuri]
 75:  729| [45] ["..."]
 76:  755| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  758| [45] ["Then it's no longer a simple medium. It's the same as the process that occurs in the human brain."]
 78:  766| [47] [Miyoko]
 79:  769| [45] ["It would be no exaggeration to say that a consciousness was born there."]
 80:  777| [47] [Yuuri]
 81:  780| [45] ["I see. I think so too, but... when you say we're going to make a consciousness, what do you mean?"]
 82:  785| [45] [When Yuuri asked that question, the professor pointed at her own head.]
 83:  811| [47] [Miyoko]
 84:  814| [45] ["The human brain is filled with high energy BC particles."]
 85:  822| [47] [Miyoko]
 86:  825| [45] ["In other words, an accumulation of information energy that is constantly transforming due to the influence of the brain."]
 87:  833| [47] [Miyoko]
 88:  836| [45] ["And conversely, the BC particles affect the brain too, causing impressions and senses to transform."]
 89:  844| [47] [Miyoko]
 90:  847| [45] ["In other words, the brain and its surrounding BC particles constantly hold a mutual effect on each other."]
 91:  873| [47] [Miyoko]
 92:  876| [45] ["... Doesn't that sound similar to what I just told you?"]
 93:  881| [45] [Everything she said suddenly snapped together in Yuuri's mind.]
 94:  889| [47] [Yuuri]
 95:  892| [45] ["A spirit...!?"]
 96:  918| [47] [Miyoko]
 97:  921| [45] ["Indeed. My thinking was that if something like a spirit were to exist, then it could possibly be the BC particles that fill the brain."]
 98:  929| [47] [Miyoko]
 99:  932| [45] ["Humanity has searched for proof of the spirit's existence since time immemorial. And its true form was an accumulation of information energy transmitted by elementary particles."]
100:  958| [47] [Miyoko]
101:  961| [45] ["--In other words, the spirit is not just a concept. It 'physically exists'."]
102:  984| [47] [Yuuri]
103:  987| [45] ["...!"]
104: 1013| [47] [Miyoko]
105: 1016| [45] ["I think there lies the answer to the age old question 'Where is the consciousness?'"]
106: 1024| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 1027| [45] ["In other words, the consciousness isn't a product of the brain... The brain is merely a storage medium, a hardware processor."]
108: 1035| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1038| [45] ["The consciousness truly comes from the spirit-- that is, not the brain itself, but the accumulation of information energy that envelops it!"]
110: 1046| [47] [Miyoko]
111: 1049| [45] ["The consciousness born from the spirit uses the brain to think and act."]
112: 1057| [47] [Miyoko]
113: 1060| [45] ["The answers and stimuli the brain obtains as a result are fed back into the consciousness, adding to the spirit's memories and experiences."]
114: 1086| [47] [Miyoko]
115: 1089| [45] ["If we can prove all of that scientifically, it could shock the entire world, couldn't it?"]
116: 1094| [45] [The professor smiled faintly.]
117: 1099| [45] [It was not the motherly smile Yuuri was used to seeing from her, but rather the smile of a pure child.]
118: 1107| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1110| [45] ["Y-you mean..."]
120: 1118| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1121| [45] ["A consciousness can exist without a brain?"]
122: 1129| [47] [Yuuri]
123: 1132| [45] ["If we made a lump of high energy BC particles outside of a brain, would that become a spirit?"]
124: 1158| [47] [Miyoko]
125: 1161| [45] ["You're quite perceptive, Yuuri. That's what tomorrow's experiment is going to confirm."]
126: 1187| [47] [Miyoko]
127: 1190| [45] ["What we're doing tomorrow is this--"]
128: 1195| [45] [Miyoko began talking about the particulars of the experiment.]
129: 1252| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1255| [45] ["First, we generate and maintain a WX particle field over 500 mSv in Area N."]
131: 1263| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1266| [45] ["But we don't load any information onto the WX particles whatsoever. If we do, then nothing more will appear in Area N than a simple lump of energy."]
133: 1274| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1277| [45] ["Then we get you to enter Area N and continuously use BC."]
135: 1319| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1322| [45] ["BC? On whom?"]
137: 1348| [47] [Miyoko]
138: 1351| [45] ["Not on anybody. Just untargeted telepathy."]
139: 1359| [47] [Miyoko]
140: 1362| [45] ["The insulators will prevent the information energy you generate from leaving Area N."]
141: 1370| [47] [Miyoko]
142: 1373| [45] ["But even so, you'll keep using telepathy, raising the information energy levels in Area N..."]
143: 1381| [47] [Miyoko]
144: 1384| [45] ["The intention is to get you to transmit all of the memories in your head as information energy."]
145: 1392| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 1395| [45] ["Why do that...?"]
147: 1421| [47] [Miyoko]
148: 1424| [45] ["Basically, what I want to check is this:"]
149: 1450| [47] [Miyoko]
150: 1453| [45] ["'If you transmit all of the information energy in your brain into Area N as BC--'"]
151: 1461| [47] [Miyoko]
152: 1464| [45] ["'--would that create another copy of your spirit?'"]
153: 1487| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 1490| [45] ["!!"]
155: 1495| [45] [Yuuri was speechless.]
156: 1500| [45] [The professor's words were logical and consistent.]
157: 1505| [45] [But the sheer scale of what they were doing came as a surprise.]
158: 1531| [47] [Miyoko]
159: 1534| [45] ["... Though by all rights, I'm not entirely sure what will happen if we do that."]
160: 1542| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 1545| [45] ["Even after all that effort, we might produce nothing more than a simple lump of information energy."]
162: 1553| [47] [Miyoko]
163: 1556| [45] ["Or perhaps it will transform after interacting with the brains of the people there like you or me."]
164: 1564| [47] [Miyoko]
165: 1567| [45] ["And if it becomes able to make decisions regarding its own transformation--"]
166: 1575| [47] [Miyoko]
167: 1578| [45] ["It may even gain its own sense of self and personally intervene with the people there."]
168: 1604| [47] [Miyoko]
169: 1607| [45] ["... And if that were to happen, it would be nothing short of the birth of a consciousness and the creation of a spirit."]
170: 1615| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 1618| [45] ["Another copy of my spirit...?"]
172: 1626| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 1629| [45] ["Th-that's kinda scary...!"]
174: 1655| [47] [Miyoko]
175: 1658| [45] ["Ah, don't worry."]
176: 1684| [47] [Miyoko]
177: 1687| [45] ["If we stop the particle amplifier and allow the energy levels to decay, then that spirit should disappear."]
178: 1695| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 1698| [45] ["But that might be a little sad..."]
180: 1724| [47] [Miyoko]
181: 1727| [45] ["... Now you're a troublesome one, aren't you? Why not help me out? It's my dearest wish."]
182: 1735| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 1738| [45] ["Your dearest wish?"]
184: 1743| [45] [The professor looked with distant eyes once Yuuri asked that.]
185: 1769| [47] [Miyoko]
186: 1772| [45] ["... This hypothesis on the creation of a spirit was an extension of what I wrote 16 years ago--"]
187: 1781| [47] [Miyoko]
188: 1784| [45] ["A paper detailing what would become the 'informational field theory'."]
189: 1793| [47] [Miyoko]
190: 1796| [45] ["In this universe, in addition to the four fundamental forces of gravity, electromagnetism, weak, and strong, there exists a fifth fundamental force, 'information'."]
191: 1804| [47] [Miyoko]
192: 1807| [45] ["And human mental activity is just another form of information. In that case, it's believable that an accumulation of information energy could hold a consciousness, isn't it?"]
193: 1815| [47] [Miyoko]
194: 1818| [45] ["In other words, could we generate an informational energy field with a sense of self--%Na 'self-aware informational field'...!? "]
195: 1844| [47] [Miyoko]
196: 1847| [45] ["That's what I had thought in my youth. But I couldn't verify it at the time."]
197: 1855| [47] [Miyoko]
198: 1858| [45] ["But after many long years, the capability of the WX particle amplifier has improved."]
199: 1866| [47] [Miyoko]
200: 1869| [45] ["We are now able to maintain a low-risk energy level of around 500 mSv for extended periods of time."]
201: 1895| [47] [Miyoko]
202: 1898| [45] ["And we have you, Yuuri, an extraordinary Communicator... With both you and the amplifier, we can finally conduct the experiment."]
203: 1924| [47] [Miyoko]
204: 1927| [45] ["So just this once, please? Not an experiment to research lifespan extensions or elucidate BC, but an experiment I want to do myself..."]
205: 1935| [47] [Miyoko]
206: 1938| [45] ["We might come in contact with a universal truth for all we know. My spirit as a scientist compels me."]
207: 1943| [45] [The professor tapered her lips in a pout.]
208: 1948| [45] [Yuuri felt that the professor was acting different from usual, in several ways.]
209: 1956| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 1959| [45] ["U-um, Professor... did something happen?"]
211: 1985| [47] [Miyoko]
212: 1988| [45] ["... Natsuhiko shouted at me today. I cried a little."]
213: 1996| [47] [Yuuri]
214: 1999| [45] ["Huh!?"]
215: 2025| [47] [Miyoko]
216: 2028| [45] ["Haah, he said 'How do you expect me to listen to everything you say when you're never around to say it'."]
217: 2054| [47] [Miyoko]
218: 2057| [45] ["I'm always working hard for his sake, yet he doesn't know a thing about it..."]
219: 2065| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 2068| [45] ["Th-that's so mean of Hikorin!"]
221: 2076| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 2079| [45] ["Okay. I'll help out with any experiment or whatever you want!"]
223: 2087| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 2090| [45] ["I'm always on your side, professor!"]
225: 2116| [47] [Miyoko]
226: 2119| [45] ["Thank you, Yuuri. Now that Yui's left the nest, you're my only ally."]
227: 2144| [45] [The professor hugged Yuuri tightly.]
228: 2149| [45] [Yuuri suddenly realized something as those arms remained wrapped around her.]
229: 2157| [47] [Yuuri]
230: 2160| [45] ["Ah, but... Professor, I just realized something."]
231: 2187| [47] [Miyoko]
232: 2190| [45] ["What is it?"]
233: 2198| [47] [Yuuri]
234: 2201| [45] ["For tomorrow's experiment, we'll be generating a 500 mSv WX particle field in Area N, right?"]
235: 2209| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 2212| [45] ["Then won't there be an 'empty spirit' in Area N until I use BC?"]
237: 2239| [47] [Miyoko]
238: 2242| [45] ["Well, it's somewhat of a stretch, but perhaps. The problem is if an empty spirit can truly be called a 'spirit', though."]
239: 2269| [47] [Miyoko]
240: 2272| [45] ["In short, a lump of information energy without memory or consciousness would just drift through the air."]
241: 2280| [47] [Yuuri]
242: 2283| [45] ["So when I pour information energy into the empty spirit, it'll give birth to a consciousness..."]
243: 2291| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 2294| [45] ["Hmm... I feel like there's some sort of major secret hiding there somewhere..."]
245: 2321| [47] [Miyoko]
246: 2324| [45] ["Oh my, have you grown an interest in physics?"]
247: 2332| [47] [Yuuri]
248: 2335| [45] ["Yes, I am your daughter after all, Professor."]
249: 2362| [47] [Miyoko]
250: 2365| [45] ["Now that's an awfully cute thing to say."]
251: 2370| [45] [Yuuri chuckled as the professor playfully nudged her forehead.]
252: 2397| [47] [Miyoko]
253: 2400| [45] ["Well, maybe we'll find out during tomorrow's experiment."]
254: 2408| [47] [Miyoko]
255: 2411| [45] ["So let's prepare for tomorrow by sleeping early tonight."]
256: 2419| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 2422| [45] ["Okay!"]
258: 2429| [45] [As Yuuri answered thusly, she completely forgot about that "secret".]
259: 2479| [45] [--It wasn't until long after that she had remembered.]
260: 2484| [45] [It was when she began walking around LABO after meeting Watase and Kazami.]
261: 2534| [45] [The two of them were talking in front of the gate leading to Area N.]
262: 2560| [47] [Watase]
263: 2563| [45] ["... Would it be possible to enter Area N and put out the fires?"]
264: 2589| [47] [Kazami]
265: 2592| [45] ["Are you out of your mind!? That's way too dangerous!"]
266: 2618| [47] [Kazami]
267: 2621| [45] ["Even if you could put out the fires, you wouldn't be able to protect yourself from getting exposed to the lethal radiation levels in there."]
268: 2647| [47] [Watase]
269: 2650| [45] ["You're right! Dammit...!"]
270: 2699| [45] [And then Watase brought his Procyon close to the gate--]
271: 2766| [47] [Watase]
272: 2769| [45] ["... Wha!?"]
273: 2774| [45] [only for the reading to start shooting up astronomically.]
274: 2782| [47] [Watase]
275: 2785| [45] ["'2406 mSv'!?"]
276: 2793| [47] [Yuuri]
277: 2796| [45] ["It almost went up by a thousand all at once--!"]
278: 2822| [47] [Kazami]
279: 2825| [45] ["It's too dangerous! Fall back!!"]
280: 2867| [47] [Watase]
281: 2870| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
282: 2875| [45] [The group frantically ran away from the door.]
283: 2881| [45] [Just then, the Procyon's reading went back to normal.]
284: 2907| [47] [Watase]
285: 2910| [45] ["Even if we could get past the gate, we'd have to face all of that...!"]
286: 2936| [47] [Kazami]
287: 2939| [45] ["... If the gate's made of lead, then it should be able to completely block off radiation..."]
288: 2947| [47] [Kazami]
289: 2950| [45] ["So perhaps the inner walls and ceiling are damaged."]
290: 2997| [45] [When Yuuri heard that, she secretly thought to herself.]
291: 3051| [47] [Yuuri]
292: 3052| [45] [(The WX particles in Area N are crossing through the BC insulators and are slowly leaking out...)]
293: 3057| [47] [Yuuri]
294: 3058| [45] [(So does that mean that the "empty spirit" is leaking out of Area N and drifting about inside LABO?)]
295: 3073| [45] [WX particles over 1000 mSv were currently spreading through the facility.]
296: 3078| [45] [So perhaps they were all walking around inside of the empty spirit.]
297: 3083| [47] [Yuuri]
298: 3084| [45] [(And what happens if we do that...?)]
299: 3089| [47] [Yuuri]
300: 3090| [45] [(Will the spirit exert some sort of influence on us?)]
301: 3095| [45] [If Yuuri used BC, then it was natural to assume that the empty spirit would receive the information energy as well.]
302: 3100| [45] [In which case, a consciousness would be born--]
303: 3105| [47] [Yuuri]
304: 3106| [45] [(... No, it wouldn't be that easy, would it?)]
305: 3111| [47] [Yuuri]
306: 3112| [45] [(That experiment was supposed to have taken hours.)]
307: 3117| [45] [And besides, it wasn't conceivable that a consciousness born like that could help her in any way.]
308: 3122| [45] [After all, it would just be a copy of Yuuri's spirit.]
309: 3155| [45] [Once Yuuri had thought about all of that, Kazami spoke up.]
310: 3181| [47] [Kazami]
311: 3184| [45] ["Be that as it may, we've now concluded our search of the inner ring, Captain. Let's assist with the search of the outer ring."]
312: 3191| [47] [Yuuri]
313: 3192| [45] [(That's right. I should be worrying about surviving rather than trivial things like that...!)]
314: 3197| [45] [With that thought in mind, Yuuri decided to stop thinking about the empty spirit.]
