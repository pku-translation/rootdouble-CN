  1:   56| [45] [A thought suddenly crossed Watase's mind as he heard that conversation.]
  2:   61| [47] [Watase]
  3:   62| [45] [(True, she really is beautiful...)]
  4:   67| [45] [But like Jun had said, she definitely had a harsh attitude to her that could turn men away.]
  5:   72| [45] [He could understand why in this situation-- but he had a hard time imagining what Kazami was like in her day-to-day life.]
  6:   77| [47] [Watase]
  7:   78| [45] [(I wonder what she looks like in normal clothes... though I'd say her uniform suits her better than any fashionable clothes or accessories ever could.)]
  8:   83| [45] [Watase suddenly remembered something at that moment.]
  9:   88| [47] [Watase]
 10:   89| [45] [(Oh yeah, speaking of accessories...)]
 11:   94| [45] [Watase reached into his pocket and pulled out...]
 12:  234| [45] [The locket with the broken chain.]
 13:  239| [45] [He'd spotted it and picked it up by chance when Kazami saved him back in Area 3.]
 14:  244| [47] [Watase]
 15:  245| [45] [(I've gotta give this back to her...)]
 16:  250| [45] [Watase pinched the locket as he thought this.]
 17:  301| [45] [It opened up when he did, revealing a photo inside.]
 18:  306| [45] [It was a picture of a sourfaced man with a somewhat stern look in his eyes.]
 19:  311| [47] [Watase]
 20:  312| [45] [(Who's this guy... something about his face pisses me off for some reason.)]
 21:  317| [45] [As Watase pondered this--]
 22:  382| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  385| [45] ["C-Captain!"]
 24:  393| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  396| [45] ["That locket-- why do you have it!?"]
 26:  404| [47] [Watase]
 27:  407| [45] ["Oh, sorry. I found it a while back, but I forgot to return it to y--"]
 28:  444| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  447| [45] ["Please give it back!"]
 30:  476| [47] [Watase]
 31:  479| [45] ["Whoa!"]
 32:  484| [45] [Kazami snatched the locket away from Watase before he even had time to say anything.]
 33:  513| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  516| [45] ["You saw what was inside, didn't you...!?"]
 35:  524| [47] [Watase]
 36:  527| [45] ["Wh-what're you getting so angry for? Carrying around a photo of your boyfriend is no big deal..."]
 37:  559| [47] [Jun]
 38:  562| [45] ["Wait, a boyfriend!?"]
 39:  588| [47] [Ena]
 40:  591| [45] ["Intriguing. Could you show it to us?"]
 41:  619| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  622| [45] ["No. That's an absolute negative."]
 43:  648| [47] [Ena]
 44:  651| [45] ["Oh my, quite a stubborn one... though I didn't expect you to be so old-fashioned as to carry a locket around."]
 45:  677| [47] [Jun]
 46:  680| [45] ["That's 'cause she hasn't taken it off in years. It's Sis' trademark."]
