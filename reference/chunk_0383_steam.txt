  1:   63| [45] [--Meanwhile, down in Area Zero--]
  2:   68| [45] [Watase's group was faced with a different type of despair.]
  3:  137| [47] [Watase]
  4:  140| [45] ["We can't... disarm the bomb...!"]
  5:  145| [45] [Watase's exhausted voice reverberated through the room.]
  6:  150| [45] [Watase and the others had taken on the tetryl bomb all by themselves.]
  7:  155| [45] [They'd managed to remove the digital protection and open the cover in just eight mere minutes.]
  8:  160| [45] [But Jun then groaned.]
  9:  195| [47] [Jun]
 10:  198| [45] ["This thing... is no normal detonator!"]
 11:  203| [45] [It was a far trickier devil than Watase and the others had imagined.]
 12:  208| [45] [It was a detonator built with a nested structure where the fuse was covered with gunpowder that was surrounded by yet another fuse.]
 13:  213| [45] [Even the slightest mistake in the disarming procedure would set off a chain explosion.]
 14:  292| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  295| [45] ["I-is there nothing we can do?"]
 16:  303| [47] [Watase]
 17:  306| [45] ["... I don't think we'd be able to do anything even if we had more time."]
 18:  314| [47] [Watase]
 19:  317| [45] ["It's completely out of our hands unless we were to use an X-ray or something to see its inner workings while disarming it."]
 20:  349| [47] [Jun]
 21:  352| [45] ["We don't have enough equipment... No, I'm not sure we could disarm this sucker even if we were fully equipped..."]
 22:  406| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  409| [45] ["Regardless, we still must take a chance and--"]
 24:  435| [47] [Jun]
 25:  438| [45] ["It's too dangerous! Even the tiniest screw up'll blow us all sky high!"]
 26:  446| [47] [Jun]
 27:  449| [45] ["We can't gamble on a risk like that!"]
 28:  472| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  473| [45] ["..."]
 30:  478| [45] [Salyu bitterly gritted her teeth.]
 31:  486| [47] [Watase]
 32:  489| [45] ["... We have no choice. Let's go back to Natsuhiko and the others for now and come up with a plan."]
 33:  515| [47] [Jun]
 34:  518| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 35:  576| [45] [The team left Subject N's room and headed for the elevator.]
 36:  581| [45] [Watase thought to himself as he waited for it to arrive.]
 37:  586| [47] [Watase]
 38:  587| [45] [(So we can't disarm the bomb. However...)]
 39:  592| [47] [Watase]
 40:  593| [45] [(There is just one way left for everyone to survive.)]
 41:  598| [45] [--No, that 'one way' wasn't technically a correct way.]
 42:  603| [45] [In fact, it was clearly the wrong way.]
 43:  608| [45] [For it was something Watase couldn't do.]
 44:  613| [47] [Watase]
 45:  614| [45] [(But if it comes down to it, I'll do it...)]
 46:  667| [45] [Watase looked over everyone's faces as he thought that.]
 47:  672| [47] [Watase]
 48:  673| [45] [(Old man, Moribe, Salyu...)]
 49:  678| [47] [Watase]
 50:  679| [45] [(I think the old man would agree with me, but...)]
 51:  762| [45] [Watase suddenly noticed something just then.]
 52:  785| [45] [Jun had been staring at Subject N's room the whole time.]
 53:  793| [47] [Watase]
 54:  796| [45] ["... What's up? You still worried about the bomb?"]
 55:  822| [47] [Jun]
 56:  825| [45] ["Ah, no..."]
 57:  851| [47] [Jun]
 58:  854| [45] ["That's not it... What's bugging me is that room itself."]
 59:  862| [47] [Watase]
 60:  865| [45] ["Huh?"]
 61:  870| [45] [Come to think of it, Jun had been surprised at first when she went into Subject N's room.]
 62:  897| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  900| [45] ["What about it troubles you?"]
 64:  932| [47] [Jun]
 65:  935| [45] ["I've seen that place long ago."]
 66:  992| [47] [Jun]
 67:  995| [45] ["I got caught up in a gas explosion that blew up an apartment complex nine years ago."]
 68: 1076| [45] [Jun stared firmly at Watase's face.]
 69: 1102| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1105| [45] ["... Don't you remember it, Captain?"]
 71: 1113| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1116| [45] ["Remember what?"]
 73: 1142| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1145| [45] ["The room you found me and Nagisa in during that incident."]
 75: 1153| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1156| [45] ["We were in Nagisa's room when it happened."]
 77: 1182| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1185| [45] ["Subject N's room is like an exact copy of that place."]
 79: 1193| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1196| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
 81: 1222| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1225| [45] ["Hey, what do you think that means?"]
 83: 1230| [45] [Watase finally realized it at that moment.]
 84: 1235| [45] [A quivering voice leaked from his lips.]
 85: 1243| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1246| [45] ["I-it can't be...!"]
 87: 1254| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1257| [45] ["Everyone thought she died nine years ago... but you're saying that in reality, Subject N is actually..."]
 89: 1265| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1268| [45] ["Kazami's sister Nagisa!?"]
 91: 1273| [45] [Jun silently nodded.]
 92: 1300| [47] [Ukita]
 93: 1303| [45] ["Wh-what!? Impossible! There is no way that could--"]
 94: 1311| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1314| [45] ["No, it's totally plausible!"]
 96: 1319| [45] [--Yuuri had been confined in LABO nine years ago after they passed her off as "dead" to her family.]
 97: 1324| [45] [So it wouldn't be all that strange if they used the same trick to confine Nagisa.]
 98: 1383| [47] [Salyu]
 99: 1386| [45] ["... So this Nagisa girl was a Communicator?"]
100: 1412| [47] [Jun]
101: 1415| [45] ["Probably... I mean, she was about to start school at Rokumei Academy..."]
102: 1423| [47] [Watase]
103: 1426| [45] ["No way...!"]
104: 1492| [45] [The elevator doors opened in synch with Watase's cry.]
105: 1507| [45] [Startled, he and the others got on it.]
106: 1567| [45] [Jun continued murmuring on their way up.]
107: 1624| [47] [Jun]
108: 1627| [45] ["... Sis had it right from the very beginning."]
109: 1635| [47] [Jun]
110: 1638| [45] ["She said 'Nagisa' when she first saw that girl lying dead in front of the cargo lift."]
111: 1646| [47] [Jun]
112: 1649| [45] ["She was right in front of me and I didn't even realize it was her...!"]
113: 1664| [45] [Her voice echoed sorrowfully through the dim elevator.]
114: 1669| [47] [Watase]
115: 1670| [45] [(Th-then I...)]
116: 1675| [47] [Watase]
117: 1676| [45] [(I caused Nagisa's death through my own terrorist plot!?)]
118: 1681| [45] [He felt harrowing regret filling him.]
119: 1686| [47] [Watase]
120: 1687| [45] [(Kazami thought her sister was dead all these years, and today she was finally able to reunite with her...)]
121: 1692| [47] [Watase]
122: 1693| [45] [(Only for Nagisa to die then and there!)]
123: 1698| [47] [Watase]
124: 1699| [45] [(If Kazami ever realized that--!!)]
125: 1704| [45] [Right when his train of thought reached that point,]
126: 1719| [45] [the elevator arrived in Area N.]
127: 1782| [45] [--A light shined upon the team.]
128: 1789| [45] [A shadow stood in the midst of that white darkness.]
129: 1797| [47] [Watase]
130: 1800| [45] ["Ah...!!"]
131: 1805| [45] [Watase looked at that shadow with wide eyes.]
132: 1875| [45] [Standing there was none other than Kazami.]
133: 1883| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1886| [45] ["I've been expecting you, Watase. Mr. Ukita...!"]
135: 1891| [45] [Tears welled up in her eyes when she said that--]
136: 1980| [47] [Kazami]
137: 1983| [45] ["If you two never committed that terrorist attack, then Nagisa wouldn't have had to die!"]
138: 2095| [45] [She pulled the trigger.]
139: 2144| [45] [--The lights in the facility went off at the exact same moment.]
140: 2187| [45] [An automatic PA broadcast echoed through the room.]
141: 2230| [47] [Automatic PA]
142: 2233| [45] ["--Emergency power supply has hit operational limit."]
143: 2238| [47] [Automatic PA]
144: 2241| [45] ["Now shifting to uninterruptible power system."]
145: 2246| [47] [Automatic PA]
146: 2249| [45] ["All power supplies, barring that to the control room, Area Zero, the WX particle amplifier, and all lifelines, will be cut."]
147: 2254| [45] [The facility was then sealed in darkness.]
148: 2297| [45] [Four shadows fumbled their way through that darkness.]
149: 2302| [45] [--There were only thirty minutes left until the lockdown lifted.]
150: 2307| [45] [Nine convictions blended in the dark--]
