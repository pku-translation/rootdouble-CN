  0:   16| [55] [√After Chapter 6]
  1:   27| [47] [Watase]
  2:   30| [45] ["!!"]
  3:   35| [45] [At that moment, he felt as if he had stepped into a raging storm.]
  4:   40| [45] [An invisible force broke over his body with earth-shattering power.]
  5:   45| [45] [Yet Watase stood his ground and opened his eyes--]
  6:   50| [45] [Then saw what lay on the other side of the gate.]
  7:  111| [47] [Watase]
  8:  114| [45] ["...!?"]
  9:  119| [45] [Watase gasped in the face of that sight.]
 10:  124| [45] [Standing on the other side of the door-- was a gigantic hall filled with the faint sound of running machinery.]
 11:  132| [47] [Watase]
 12:  135| [45] ["Wha... what the hell!?"]
 13:  140| [45] [There was supposed to be a melted down nuclear reactor there.]
 14:  145| [45] [There were supposed to be fires causing the security system to go haywire there.]
 15:  150| [45] [Yet all he saw was a cold, empty room.]
 16:  190| [47] [Watase]
 17:  193| [45] ["... Wh... what's going on..."]
 18:  201| [47] [Watase]
 19:  204| [45] ["Where's the burning reactor!?"]
 20:  209| [45] [Watase threw the hose aside and looked around.]
 21:  214| [45] [A transparent cylinder stood in the center of Area N, surrounded by six towering spire-like installations.]
 22:  219| [45] [Those installations all connected to each other near the ceiling, forming a hexagram.]
 23:  227| [47] [Watase]
 24:  230| [45] ["... What... what is this machine!?"]
 25:  279| [45] [Watase staggered over to that device.]
 26:  284| [45] [Now that he thought about it, he didn't really know what a nuclear reactor looked like.]
 27:  289| [45] [But-- he had a feeling that what he was looking at was no nuclear reactor.]
 28:  335| [47] [Watase]
 29:  338| [45] ["H-hold on..."]
 30:  346| [47] [Watase]
 31:  349| [45] ["Come to think about it, wasn't there something like this in that data Teach showed me...!?"]
 32:  354| [45] [Watase strained his brain to remember the words he'd seen earlier.]
 33:  359| [47] [Watase]
 34:  360| [45] [(Let's see, the words in that search list were--)]
 35:  365| [45] ["Case N" "meltdown" "brain dysfunction", "Subject N" "WX particle" "particle amplifier"%N"WX particle spread".]
 36:  373| [47] [Watase]
 37:  376| [45] ["This doesn't make sense...!!"]
 38:  381| [45] [He finally realized what had been the source of that uncomfortable feeling he'd gotten back then.]
 39:  386| [45] [Though "Case N" and "meltdown" had shown up on that list, terms that -should- have been there weren't.]
 40:  391| [45] [There had been not a single sign of the terms "nuclear reactor" "radiation"%N"radioactive material" or "radiation exposure".]
 41:  396| [45] [Instead, there were mysterious terms like "WX particle" and "particle amplifier".]
 42:  401| [45] [It was clearly strange. Watase couldn't explain it.]
 43:  406| [45] [However-- he felt the answer lied in this room.]
 44:  414| [47] [Watase]
 45:  417| [45] ["... It's not just that there's no fire here..."]
 46:  425| [47] [Watase]
 47:  428| [45] ["Could it be..."]
 48:  436| [47] [Watase]
 49:  439| [45] ["That there was never a nuclear reactor here to begin with!?"]
 50:  444| [45] [Watase's shout was full of astonishment.]
 51:  452| [47] [Watase]
 52:  455| [45] ["Wh-what's going on!? Were we tricked!?"]
 53:  463| [47] [Watase]
 54:  466| [45] ["But by whom, and why!?"]
 55:  471| [45] [His confusion begot more questions. He felt like he'd heard the same words being screamed at some point in the past.]
 56:  476| [47] [Watase]
 57:  477| [45] [(Did the Commander lie to us!?)]
 58:  482| [47] [Watase]
 59:  483| [45] [(But why would he ever do that!?)]
 60:  488| [47] [Watase]
 61:  489| [45] [(No, the ones I -should- be doubting are the staff of LABO...!)]
 62:  494| [47] [Watase]
 63:  495| [45] [(So does that include old man Ukita too...!?)]
 64:  500| [45] [From what Watase had seen from how everyone had acted, it seemed the entire city believed that LABO housed a nuclear reactor.]
 65:  505| [45] [Then why did the people running LABO lie about that?]
 66:  510| [45] [What meaning was there in putting on such an elaborate ruse to fool the townspeople?]
 67:  515| [45] [Watase's head hurt again when he thought about that.]
 68:  592| [47] [Watase]
 69:  595| [45] ["!!"]
 70:  600| [45] [It felt far worse than any of his other headaches. All his wounds and skin also began to hurt at the same time.]
 71:  608| [47] [Watase]
 72:  611| [45] ["Agh.. khh...!"]
 73:  618| [45] [To make matters worse, his body started shaking for no apparent reason.]
 74:  623| [47] [Watase]
 75:  624| [45] [(Wait... are these convulsions!?)]
 76:  632| [47] [Watase]
 77:  635| [45] ["Sh-shit...!"]
 78:  640| [45] [He frantically looked around, hoping to find an exit.]
 79:  645| [45] [But instead-- he spotted a strange object.]
 80:  695| [47] [Watase]
 81:  698| [45] ["!?"]
 82:  703| [45] [Something was lying on the ground further up ahead.]
 83:  708| [45] [He staggered on over to it and picked it up. It was a security card that'd been split into two.]
 84:  713| [45] [The name on the card was "Miyoko Tenkawa". Its security level was "Lv. N".]
 85:  721| [47] [Watase]
 86:  724| [45] ["What's this doing here...!?"]
 87:  729| [45] [Just then, an unpleasant stench suddenly took hold of Watase's nose.]
 88:  734| [45] [It was a familiar stench, albeit a hundred times worse than any past experience he'd had with it...]
 89:  739| [45] [The stench of blood.]
 90:  747| [47] [Watase]
 91:  750| [45] ["...!"]
 92:  755| [45] [A bad feeling rose in Watase's heart as he took a look behind the device.]
 93:  764| [55] [√After Chapter 6]
 94:  884| [47] [Watase]
 95:  887| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 96:  892| [45] [A boy garbed in a school uniform was lying there.]
 97:  897| [45] [His body was collapsed in a pool of spreading blood.]
 98:  902| [47] [Watase]
 99:  903| [45] [(Isn't that... Natsuhiko Tenkawa!?)]
100:  908| [45] [His name and face matched up perfectly with Watase's memory of him.]
101:  916| [47] [Watase]
102:  919| [45] ["Hey! Are you okay!?"]
103:  924| [45] [But Natsuhiko didn't respond to his calls.]
104:  929| [45] [Watase took off his gloves and pressed his index finger against Natsuhiko's carotid artery.]
105:  934| [47] [Watase]
106:  935| [45] [(...!!)]
107:  940| [45] [He couldn't feel a pulse, and Natsuhiko's body was cold.]
108:  985| [45] [Watase frantically laid Natsuhiko flat on the floor and began CPR.]
109:  990| [47] [Watase]
110:  991| [45] [(Just do it like Tachibana and Moribe did--!)]
111:  996| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
112: 1001| [45] [No reaction.]
113: 1006| [47] [Watase]
114: 1007| [45] [(Goddammit... goddammit!)]
115: 1012| [45] [Watase desperately continued to perform CPR while fighting off his headache and convulsions.]
116: 1017| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
117: 1022| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
118: 1027| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions.%N2 rescue breaths.]
119: 1032| [47] [Watase]
120: 1033| [45] [(Please... don't die!)]
121: 1038| [45] [Soon enough, Watase felt a faint pulse--]
122: 1052| [47] [Watase]
123: 1055| [45] ["I... I did it!"]
124: 1060| [45] [Watase pressed his hand against Natsuhiko's mouth, and felt the boy's breath.]
125: 1065| [45] [But that didn't change the fact that he had nigh-fatal wounds.]
126: 1110| [45] [It'd be a miracle if he survived after losing that much blood.]
127: 1115| [47] [Watase]
128: 1116| [45] [(But why's he bleeding so bad to begin with...!?)]
129: 1121| [45] [Watase looked over Natsuhiko's body to find there were several small holes and wounds here and there behind his uniform.]
130: 1129| [47] [Watase]
131: 1132| [45] ["... Gunshot wounds!?"]
132: 1137| [45] [The sight of them was no longer as shocking to Watase after having seen so many of them before.]
133: 1142| [45] [Just then, he noticed something lying next to Natsuhiko.]
134: 1248| [47] [Watase]
135: 1251| [45] ["Th-this is...!"]
136: 1256| [45] [He felt the object's heavy weight pass through his arms when he picked it up.]
137: 1261| [45] [It was different from the one Ena had, but it was undoubtedly a pistol.]
138: 1311| [47] [Watase]
139: 1314| [45] ["Was Natsuhiko attacked by the killer too...!?"]
140: 1319| [45] [Watase groaned in shock. But at that moment--]
141: 1530| [47] [Watase]
142: 1533| [45] ["!!"]
143: 1576| [45] [--A mysterious fear flared up in him.]
144: 1657| [47] [???]
145: 1660| [45] ["... Ha."]
146: 1665| [45] [The monster looked at him and laughed.]
147: 1670| [45] [At that moment, just as an indescribable fear sent shivers down his spine--]
148: 1678| [47] [Watase]
149: 1681| [45] ["!!"]
150: 1755| [45] [He was assaulted by an intense pain akin to his brain being crushed.]
151: 1763| [47] [Watase]
152: 1766| [45] ["Agh, GAAAAAAAH!!"]
153: 1771| [45] [The man screamed, faced with an agony unlike anything he had ever felt before.]
154: 1779| [47] [Watase]
155: 1782| [45] ["Th-that was...!?"]
156: 1790| [47] [Watase]
157: 1793| [45] ["My head, it can't be... not you too!!"]
158: 1798| [45] [His well-toned body proved helpless in the face of that power.]
159: 1803| [47] [Watase]
160: 1804| [45] [(You... you damned monster!)]
161: 1809| [45] [In spite of that, he struggled against it, attempting to complete his mission. Nevertheless--]
162: 1886| [47] [Watase]
163: 1889| [45] ["!!!"]
164: 1894| [45] [His will broke as the overwhelming pain surged through his head once more.]
165: 1902| [47] [Watase]
166: 1905| [45] ["Aah... aah..."]
167: 1910| [45] [He staggered backwards, clutching his head.]
168: 1915| [45] [The monster's face warped sinisterly, its gaze piercing right through him.]
169: 1923| [47] [Watase]
170: 1926| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
171: 1980| [45] [He then fled without looking back.]
172: 1985| [45] [If he'd stood his ground, he'd be killed. Annihilated.]
173: 1990| [45] [And so he held his throbbing head as he ran for his life.]
174: 2038| [47] [Watase]
175: 2039| [45] [(I have to get away... as far away as possible!)]
176: 2094| [45] [He had to retreat to a place where the monster's power couldn't reach him.]
177: 2143| [45] [But it was all for naught--]
178: 2195| [45] [Everything in front of him flashed as he felt an agony like that of his head exploding.]
179: 2203| [47] [Watase]
180: 2206| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
181: 2277| [47] [Watase]
182: 2280| [45] ["...!?"]
183: 2288| [47] [Watase]
184: 2291| [45] ["Wha... what the hell was that...!?"]
185: 2296| [45] [It was a memory he had no recollection of.]
186: 2301| [45] [It seemed like it was a memory of just before Watase had lost his memories.]
187: 2306| [45] [And the thing that had scared Watase so much back then-- was this boy right in front of him!?]
188: 2311| [47] [Watase]
189: 2312| [45] [(... No way, there's no way that's true!)]
190: 2317| [45] [Watase shook his head to dismiss that delusion.]
191: 2322| [47] [Watase]
192: 2323| [45] [(Anyway, I've gotta get him to a safe place...!)]
193: 2328| [45] [Watase put the pistol in his breast pocket, then lifted Natsuhiko's body up into his arms.]
194: 2333| [45] [--But just then--]
195: 2391| [47] [Watase]
196: 2394| [45] ["!?"]
197: 2399| [45] [Watase felt a presence behind him.]
198: 2466| [45] [--He turned around, then saw it.]
199: 2518| [45] [Someone with a tiny frame was charging straight at him.]
200: 2523| [45] [In their hand was--]
201: 2568| [47] [Watase]
202: 2569| [45] [(An axe!?)]
203: 2574| [45] [Just as Watase realized that,]
204: 2742| [45] [the figure swung the axe down towards the crown of his head.]
