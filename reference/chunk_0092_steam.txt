  0:   65| [55] [√After Chapter 6]
  1:   76| [47] [Watase]
  2:   79| [45] ["!!"]
  3:   84| [45] [At that moment, he felt as if he had stepped into a raging storm.]
  4:   89| [45] [An invisible force broke over his body with earth-shattering power.]
  5:   94| [45] [Yet Watase stood his ground and opened his eyes--]
  6:   99| [45] [Then saw what lay on the other side of the gate.]
  7:  160| [47] [Watase]
  8:  163| [45] ["...!?"]
  9:  168| [45] [Watase gasped in the face of that sight.]
 10:  173| [45] [Standing on the other side of the door-- was a gigantic hall filled with the faint sound of running machinery.]
 11:  181| [47] [Watase]
 12:  184| [45] ["Wha... what the hell!?"]
 13:  189| [45] [There was supposed to be a melted down nuclear reactor there.]
 14:  194| [45] [There were supposed to be fires causing the security system to go haywire there.]
 15:  199| [45] [Yet all he saw was a cold, empty room.]
 16:  239| [47] [Watase]
 17:  242| [45] ["... Wh... what's going on..."]
 18:  250| [47] [Watase]
 19:  253| [45] ["Where's the burning reactor!?"]
 20:  258| [45] [Watase threw the hose aside and looked around.]
 21:  263| [45] [A transparent cylinder stood in the center of Area N, surrounded by six towering spire-like installations.]
 22:  268| [45] [Those installations all connected to each other near the ceiling, forming a hexagram.]
 23:  276| [47] [Watase]
 24:  279| [45] ["... What... what is this machine!?"]
 25:  328| [45] [Watase staggered over to that device.]
 26:  333| [45] [Now that he thought about it, he didn't really know what a nuclear reactor looked like.]
 27:  338| [45] [But-- he had a feeling that what he was looking at was no nuclear reactor.]
 28:  384| [47] [Watase]
 29:  387| [45] ["H-hold on..."]
 30:  395| [47] [Watase]
 31:  398| [45] ["Come to think about it, wasn't there something like this in that data Teach showed me...!?"]
 32:  403| [45] [Watase strained his brain to remember the words he'd seen earlier.]
 33:  408| [47] [Watase]
 34:  409| [45] [(Let's see, the words in that search list were--)]
 35:  414| [45] ["Case N" "meltdown" "brain dysfunction", "Subject N" "WX particle" "particle amplifier"%N"WX particle spread".]
 36:  422| [47] [Watase]
 37:  425| [45] ["This doesn't make sense...!!"]
 38:  430| [45] [He finally realized what had been the source of that uncomfortable feeling he'd gotten back then.]
 39:  435| [45] [Though "Case N" and "meltdown" had shown up on that list, terms that -should- have been there weren't.]
 40:  440| [45] [There had been not a single sign of the terms "nuclear reactor" "radiation"%N"radioactive material" or "radiation exposure".]
 41:  445| [45] [Instead, there were mysterious terms like "WX particle" and "particle amplifier".]
 42:  450| [45] [It was clearly strange. Watase couldn't explain it.]
 43:  455| [45] [However-- he felt the answer lied in this room.]
 44:  463| [47] [Watase]
 45:  466| [45] ["... It's not just that there's no fire here..."]
 46:  474| [47] [Watase]
 47:  477| [45] ["Could it be..."]
 48:  485| [47] [Watase]
 49:  488| [45] ["That there was never a nuclear reactor here to begin with!?"]
 50:  493| [45] [Watase's shout was full of astonishment.]
 51:  501| [47] [Watase]
 52:  504| [45] ["Wh-what's going on!? Were we tricked!?"]
 53:  512| [47] [Watase]
 54:  515| [45] ["But by whom, and why!?"]
 55:  520| [45] [His confusion begot more questions. He felt like he'd heard the same words being screamed at some point in the past.]
 56:  525| [47] [Watase]
 57:  526| [45] [(Did the Commander lie to us!?)]
 58:  531| [47] [Watase]
 59:  532| [45] [(But why would he ever do that!?)]
 60:  537| [47] [Watase]
 61:  538| [45] [(No, the ones I -should- be doubting are the staff of LABO...!)]
 62:  543| [47] [Watase]
 63:  544| [45] [(So does that include old man Ukita too...!?)]
 64:  549| [45] [From what Watase had seen from how everyone had acted, it seemed the entire city believed that LABO housed a nuclear reactor.]
 65:  554| [45] [Then why did the people running LABO lie about that?]
 66:  559| [45] [What meaning was there in putting on such an elaborate ruse to fool the townspeople?]
 67:  564| [45] [Watase's head hurt again when he thought about that.]
 68:  641| [47] [Watase]
 69:  644| [45] ["!!"]
 70:  649| [45] [It felt far worse than any of his other headaches. All his wounds and skin also began to hurt at the same time.]
 71:  657| [47] [Watase]
 72:  660| [45] ["Agh.. khh...!"]
 73:  667| [45] [To make matters worse, his body started shaking for no apparent reason.]
 74:  672| [47] [Watase]
 75:  673| [45] [(Wait... are these convulsions!?)]
 76:  681| [47] [Watase]
 77:  684| [45] ["Sh-shit...!"]
 78:  689| [45] [He frantically looked around, hoping to find an exit.]
 79:  694| [45] [But instead-- he spotted a strange object.]
 80:  744| [47] [Watase]
 81:  747| [45] ["!?"]
 82:  752| [45] [Something was lying on the ground further up ahead.]
 83:  757| [45] [He staggered on over to it and picked it up. It was a security card that'd been split into two.]
 84:  762| [45] [The name on the card was "Miyoko Tenkawa". Its security level was "Lv. N".]
 85:  770| [47] [Watase]
 86:  773| [45] ["What's this doing here...!?"]
 87:  778| [45] [Just then, an unpleasant stench suddenly took hold of Watase's nose.]
 88:  783| [45] [It was a familiar stench, albeit a hundred times worse than any past experience he'd had with it...]
 89:  788| [45] [The stench of blood.]
 90:  796| [47] [Watase]
 91:  799| [45] ["...!"]
 92:  804| [45] [A bad feeling rose in Watase's heart as he took a look behind the device.]
 93:  813| [55] [√After Chapter 6]
 94:  933| [47] [Watase]
 95:  936| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 96:  941| [45] [A boy garbed in a school uniform was lying there.]
 97:  946| [45] [His body was collapsed in a pool of spreading blood.]
 98:  951| [47] [Watase]
 99:  952| [45] [(Isn't that... Natsuhiko Tenkawa!?)]
100:  957| [45] [His name and face matched up perfectly with Watase's memory of him.]
101:  965| [47] [Watase]
102:  968| [45] ["Hey! Are you okay!?"]
103:  973| [45] [But Natsuhiko didn't respond to his calls.]
104:  978| [45] [Watase took off his gloves and pressed his index finger against Natsuhiko's carotid artery.]
105:  983| [47] [Watase]
106:  984| [45] [(...!!)]
107:  989| [45] [He couldn't feel a pulse, and Natsuhiko's body was cold.]
108: 1034| [45] [Watase frantically laid Natsuhiko flat on the floor and began CPR.]
109: 1039| [47] [Watase]
110: 1040| [45] [(Just do it like Tachibana and Moribe did--!)]
111: 1045| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
112: 1050| [45] [No reaction.]
113: 1055| [47] [Watase]
114: 1056| [45] [(Goddammit... goddammit!)]
115: 1061| [45] [Watase desperately continued to perform CPR while fighting off his headache and convulsions.]
116: 1066| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
117: 1071| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
118: 1076| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions.%N2 rescue breaths.]
119: 1081| [47] [Watase]
120: 1082| [45] [(Please... don't die!)]
121: 1087| [45] [Soon enough, Watase felt a faint pulse--]
122: 1101| [47] [Watase]
123: 1104| [45] ["I... I did it!"]
124: 1109| [45] [Watase pressed his hand against Natsuhiko's mouth, and felt the boy's breath.]
125: 1114| [45] [But that didn't change the fact that he had nigh-fatal wounds.]
126: 1159| [45] [It'd be a miracle if he survived after losing that much blood.]
127: 1164| [47] [Watase]
128: 1165| [45] [(But why's he bleeding so bad to begin with...!?)]
129: 1170| [45] [Watase looked over Natsuhiko's body to find there were several small holes and wounds here and there behind his uniform.]
130: 1178| [47] [Watase]
131: 1181| [45] ["... Gunshot wounds!?"]
132: 1186| [45] [The sight of them was no longer as shocking to Watase after having seen so many of them before.]
133: 1191| [45] [Just then, he noticed something lying next to Natsuhiko.]
134: 1297| [47] [Watase]
135: 1300| [45] ["Th-this is...!"]
136: 1305| [45] [He felt the object's heavy weight pass through his arms when he picked it up.]
137: 1310| [45] [It was different from the one Ena had, but it was undoubtedly a pistol.]
138: 1360| [47] [Watase]
139: 1363| [45] ["Was Natsuhiko attacked by the killer too...!?"]
140: 1368| [45] [Watase groaned in shock. But at that moment--]
141: 1579| [47] [Watase]
142: 1582| [45] ["!!"]
143: 1625| [45] [--A mysterious fear flared up in him.]
144: 1706| [47] [???]
145: 1709| [45] ["... Ha."]
146: 1714| [45] [The monster looked at him and laughed.]
147: 1719| [45] [At that moment, just as an indescribable fear sent shivers down his spine--]
148: 1727| [47] [Watase]
149: 1730| [45] ["!!"]
150: 1804| [45] [He was assaulted by an intense pain akin to his brain being crushed.]
151: 1812| [47] [Watase]
152: 1815| [45] ["Agh, GAAAAAAAH!!"]
153: 1820| [45] [The man screamed, faced with an agony unlike anything he had ever felt before.]
154: 1828| [47] [Watase]
155: 1831| [45] ["Th-that was...!?"]
156: 1839| [47] [Watase]
157: 1842| [45] ["My head, it can't be... not you too!!"]
158: 1847| [45] [His well-toned body proved helpless in the face of that power.]
159: 1852| [47] [Watase]
160: 1853| [45] [(You... you damned monster!)]
161: 1858| [45] [In spite of that, he struggled against it, attempting to complete his mission. Nevertheless--]
162: 1935| [47] [Watase]
163: 1938| [45] ["!!!"]
164: 1943| [45] [His will broke as the overwhelming pain surged through his head once more.]
165: 1951| [47] [Watase]
166: 1954| [45] ["Aah... aah..."]
167: 1959| [45] [He staggered backwards, clutching his head.]
168: 1964| [45] [The monster's face warped sinisterly, its gaze piercing right through him.]
169: 1972| [47] [Watase]
170: 1975| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
171: 2029| [45] [He then fled without looking back.]
172: 2034| [45] [If he'd stood his ground, he'd be killed. Annihilated.]
173: 2039| [45] [And so he held his throbbing head as he ran for his life.]
174: 2087| [47] [Watase]
175: 2088| [45] [(I have to get away... as far away as possible!)]
176: 2143| [45] [He had to retreat to a place where the monster's power couldn't reach him.]
177: 2192| [45] [But it was all for naught--]
178: 2244| [45] [Everything in front of him flashed as he felt an agony like that of his head exploding.]
179: 2252| [47] [Watase]
180: 2255| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
181: 2326| [47] [Watase]
182: 2329| [45] ["...!?"]
183: 2337| [47] [Watase]
184: 2340| [45] ["Wha... what the hell was that...!?"]
185: 2345| [45] [It was a memory he had no recollection of.]
186: 2350| [45] [It seemed like it was a memory of just before Watase had lost his memories.]
187: 2355| [45] [And the thing that had scared Watase so much back then-- was this boy right in front of him!?]
188: 2360| [47] [Watase]
189: 2361| [45] [(... No way, there's no way that's true!)]
190: 2366| [45] [Watase shook his head to dismiss that delusion.]
191: 2371| [47] [Watase]
192: 2372| [45] [(Anyway, I've gotta get him to a safe place...!)]
193: 2377| [45] [Watase put the pistol in his breast pocket, then lifted Natsuhiko's body up into his arms.]
194: 2382| [45] [--But just then--]
195: 2440| [47] [Watase]
196: 2443| [45] ["!?"]
197: 2448| [45] [Watase felt a presence behind him.]
198: 2515| [45] [--He turned around, then saw it.]
199: 2567| [45] [Someone with a tiny frame was charging straight at him.]
200: 2572| [45] [In their hand was--]
201: 2617| [47] [Watase]
202: 2618| [45] [(An axe!?)]
203: 2623| [45] [Just as Watase realized that,]
204: 2791| [45] [the figure swung the axe down towards the crown of his head.]
