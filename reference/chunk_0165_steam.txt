  1:   87| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   88| [45] [(--!!)]
  3:  125| [45] [Natsuhiko came to his senses.]
  4:  162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  163| [45] [(Where am I!?)]
  6:  333| [45] [Right before his eyes were two rescue squad members collapsed on the floor.]
  7:  386| [45] [As well as Salyu, the one who put them there.]
  8:  453| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Yuuri looked at the situation in awestruck surprise.]
  9:  576| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  577| [45] [(C-calm down...! This is no time to space out!)]
 11:  582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  583| [45] [(Why would Salyu kick down some rescue squad members!?)]
 13:  588| [45] [Natsuhiko was horribly confused.]
 14:  593| [45] [But the answer to his question lied in what he had just been seeing.]
 15:  598| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  599| [45] [(No, hold on...!)]
 17:  604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  605| [45] [(Salyu's working to protect us. I should be able to trust her.)]
 19:  610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  611| [45] [(In that case, the fact that Salyu kicked these guys down means--!?)]
 21:  730| [45] [Electricity ran through Natsuhiko's spine.]
 22:  735| [45] [He then realized exactly who those people were.]
 23:  840| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  843| [45] ["Mashiro, these guys... are no rescue squad members."]
 25:  869| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  872| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 27:  880| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  883| [45] ["They're the ones who attacked us at that abandoned factory last night!"]
 29:  909| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  912| [45] ["!"]
 31:  981| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko said that, one of the collapsed men glared at him.]
 32:  987| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 33:  990| [45] ["... You'd have been better off not noticing that...!"]
 34:  998| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35: 1001| [45] ["...!"]
 36: 1006| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 37: 1009| [45] ["We should've put you through a little more pain back then...%NIt was a mistake to show you mercy."]
 38: 1032| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 39: 1035| [45] ["This time, we're gonna shut you up for sure."]
 40: 1205| [45] [And with that, the man lunged towards the kids.]
 41: 1255| [45] [But then Salyu stepped forward ever so slightly,]
 42: 1299| [47] [Salyu]
 43: 1302| [45] ["HA!!"]
 44: 1417| [45] [grabbed the man by the arm, and hurled him to the ground.]
 45: 1518| [47] [Rescue Worker 2]
 46: 1521| [45] ["Tch!!"]
 47: 1526| [45] [The man shoulder rolled safely back to his feet and lunged at Salyu once more.]
 48: 1546| [45] [As she readied to counter him, Salyu shouted.]
 49: 1766| [47] [Salyu]
 50: 1769| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Mashiro! Run!"]
 51: 1777| [47] [Mashiro]
 52: 1780| [45] ["Salyu!?"]
 53: 1788| [47] [Salyu]
 54: 1791| [45] ["I'll get rid of him! The other one's fainted, so I can manage one-on-one combat!"]
 55: 1799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56: 1802| [45] ["Then let me help--!"]
 57: 1828| [47] [Salyu]
 58: 1831| [45] ["No, Natsuhiko, you guys will only drag me down!%NI can't deal with a hostage situation if they get you!"]
 59: 1839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60: 1842| [45] ["!!"]
 61: 1868| [47] [Salyu]
 62: 1871| [45] ["You guys go find an exit! If you find one, contact me through telepathy!"]
 63: 1925| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1928| [45] ["--...gh."]
 65: 1933| [45] [Hesitation wormed its way into Natsuhiko's mind.]
 66: 1997| [45] [But Mashiro grabbed him by the arm and said,]
 67: 2008| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 2011| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Let's just do what Salyu says! We'd only get in her way!"]
 69: 2037| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 2040| [45] ["Hikorin, Salyu will be okay by herself!"]
 71: 2045| [45] [Mashiro and Yuuri were right.]
 72: 2050| [45] [Natsuhiko shouted to shake off his frustration.]
 73: 2128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 2131| [45] ["Salyu, it's a promise! We -will- get out of here-- together!"]
 75: 2157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 2160| [45] ["We'll find an exit and wait for you, okay!?"]
 77: 2204| [45] [And then he turned back and ran off with Mashiro and Yuuri.]
 78: 2348| [47] [Mashiro]
 79: 2351| [45] ["Let's head to the 'inner ring'! There are supposed to be emergency staircases there!"]
 80: 2451| [45] [In accordance with Mashiro's proposal, they headed through the passageway.]
 81: 2463| [45] [As they ran, Natsuhiko pondered to himself.]
 82: 2468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 2469| [45] [(In any case, why did I remember the past again...!?)]
 84: 2474| [45] [Just a moment ago, he was recalling a detailed account of the events of September 12.]
 85: 2479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 2480| [45] [(Why does this keep happening...?)]
 87: 2485| [45] [There was something clearly strange about it. Was he really just recalling his memories?]
 88: 2490| [45] [Suddenly, he remembered the words Salyu had said that day.]
 89: 2594| [47] [Salyu]
 90: 2597| [45] ["... The brain actively works to rationalize its perceptions and eliminate inconsistencies. This is just an obvious example of that."]
 91: 2638| [47] [Salyu]
 92: 2641| [45] ["Depending on the circumstances, the brain will even distort reality."]
 93: 2679| [45] [--Natsuhiko was taken aback as he remembered those words.]
 94: 2684| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 2685| [45] [(Don't tell me what I saw was another type of hallucination!?)]
 96: 2690| [45] [Just a few days ago, Natsuhiko was enjoying peaceful days with those around him.]
 97: 2759| [45] [But now they were running for their lives.]
 98: 2764| [45] [It was no exaggeration to say Natsuhiko regretted that fact.]
 99: 2769| [45] [He probably wanted to return to those peaceful days.]
100: 2774| [45] [So perhaps he had run away into his memories as a means of escaping from reality?]
101: 2779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 2780| [45] [(Would my brain just automatically do that on its own...?)]
103: 2785| [45] [But even if that were the case, it wouldn't change reality at all.]
104: 2790| [45] [Natsuhiko glanced at his watch.]
105: 2960| [45] [It was stopped on "9/16" at "6:19", the time it broke due to the impact of an explosion.]
106: 2965| [45] [Every time his recollections would end, he'd catch sight of his watch.]
107: 2970| [45] [As if it were trying to pull him back to reality.]
108: 3055| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 3056| [45] [(... Is it my brain commanding me to face reality?)]
110: 3061| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 3062| [45] [(Is the command to face reality conflicting with the instinct to run away from it?)]
112: 3136| [45] [The answer would be obvious if that were the case.]
113: 3141| [45] [He had to face reality or they would almost surely die.]
114: 3146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 3147| [45] [(No... I get the feeling that wouldn't be the end of it...)]
116: 3152| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 3153| [45] [(Ever since I started recalling these memories, they always end in--)]
118: 3361| [45] [As Natsuhiko pondered, he glanced at Yuuri, but he snapped out of it when Mashiro spoke up.]
119: 3506| [47] [Mashiro]
120: 3509| [45] ["Look, an emergency staircase!"]
121: 3517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 3520| [45] ["!! Wait, I'll go check if it's safe first!"]
123: 3553| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko entered the stairwell.]
124: 3721| [45] [The stairs were safe.]
125: 3726| [45] [But as soon as he started to go up those stairs, he heard a sound from up above.]
126: 3950| [47] [???]
127: 3953| [45] ["Ah!"]
128: 3964| [45] [When he looked up, he saw someone in a protection suit.]
129: 3972| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 3975| [45] ["Another one of them?"]
131: 3980| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 3981| [45] [(Crap, if he gets to Salyu--!)]
133: 4034| [45] [Natsuhiko suddenly raised his voice.]
134: 4042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 4045| [45] ["Hey, you! Over here, over here!"]
136: 4083| [47] [???]
137: 4086| [45] ["...!?"]
138: 4107| [45] [The figure hesitated for a second before rushing towards the kids.]
139: 4235| [45] [The kids turned around and rushed down the stairs.]
140: 4524| [45] [They ran down all the way to the second basement floor and flew out of the stairwell.]
141: 4596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 4597| [45] [(Dammit, how many of them are there!?)]
143: 4602| [45] [The staircase leading to the surface was already enemy territory.]
144: 4607| [45] [They felt a presence chasing after them.]
145: 4709| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 4712| [45] ["What now, Natsuhiko? Where can we run!?"]
147: 4720| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 4723| [45] ["The broadcast said there are staircases outside of Area 2 that are still okay!"]
149: 4749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 4752| [45] ["So let's head to Area 3! We should be able to escape from there!"]
151: 4778| [47] [Mashiro]
152: 4781| [45] ["B-but which way is Area 3!?"]
153: 4807| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 4810| [45] ["This way! I'll lead you!"]
155: 4842| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro followed Yuuri towards Area 3.]
156: 5075| [45] [They slipped through the passageway,]
157: 5219| [45] [and headed toward the Area 3 inner ring emergency staircase.]
158: 5389| [45] [But it didn't look like they could escape from there, either.]
159: 5394| [45] [The segment connecting the first and second basement levels was okay, but the segment leading up from there to the surface level had been blown up.]
160: 5402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 5405| [45] ["Dammit, here too!?"]
162: 5507| [47] [Mashiro]
163: 5510| [45] ["Natsuhiko, over there! We haven't looked at the stairs over there yet!"]
164: 5518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 5521| [45] ["Yeah!"]
166: 5580| [45] [They started running again after Mashiro shouted.]
167: 5732| [45] [And thus they headed to the last staircase in Area 3.]
168: 5875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 5876| [45] [(Please be safe...!)]
170: 5950| [45] [Natsuhiko prayed as they opened the door to the stairwell.]
171: 6203| [45] [The staircase was safe. Nothing was broken at all from the bottom of the 2nd basement level all the way to the surface.]
172: 6211| [47] [Mashiro]
173: 6214| [45] ["Thank goodness, now we're in the clear--"]
174: 6219| [45] [Right as Mashiro rejoiced,]
175: 6399| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 6402| [45] ["!"]
177: 6407| [45] [A blast of flames surged up before their very eyes.]
178: 6509| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 6512| [45] ["Aaah!"]
180: 6520| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 6523| [45] ["Watch out, you two!"]
182: 6595| [45] [Natsuhiko covered the girls as they hid in the corner of the stairwell.]
183: 6609| [45] [They felt a wave of heat blazing over their heads.]
184: 6698| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 6701| [45] ["Ugh... Yuuri, Mashiro, you two okay?"]
186: 6706| [45] [The girls answered him with trembling voices.]
187: 6760| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 6763| [45] ["I-I'm okay, but..."]
189: 6835| [47] [Yuuri]
190: 6838| [45] ["The staircase...!"]
191: 7041| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 7044| [45] ["Ah..."]
193: 7049| [45] [As he turned to look, Natsuhiko saw the wreckage of the staircase following the explosion.]
194: 7054| [45] [Now they couldn't even go up to the 1st basement level from here.]
195: 7059| [45] [--And then, a broadcast rang out for the nth time that day.]
196: 7125| [85] ["... staircases have almost all been destroyed!]
197: 7127| [85] [But Areas 5 and 6's staircases are still intact!"]
198: 7131| [86] ["... staircases have almost all been destroyed! But Areas 5 and 6's staircases are still intact!"]
199: 7140| [85] ["All personnel in the facility, please evacuate immediately!"]
200: 7144| [86] ["All personnel in the facility, please evacuate immediately!"]
201: 7201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 7204| [45] ["Area 5...!?"]
203: 7209| [45] [Natsuhiko groaned.]
204: 7214| [45] [They had left Salyu in Area 2.]
205: 7219| [45] [Running to Area 5 would put quite a distance between them.]
206: 7245| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 7248| [45] ["Wh-what do we do? Should we head to Area 5?"]
208: 7256| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 7259| [45] ["No, in that case, I'd rather--"]
210: 7264| [45] [Before Natsuhiko could finish, Yuuri raised her voice.]
211: 7356| [47] [Yuuri]
212: 7359| [45] ["No! Hikorin, remember what it is you need to do!"]
213: 7367| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 7370| [45] ["!?"]
215: 7378| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 7381| [45] ["What is your duty!? There's something you need to do first, remember!?"]
217: 7392| [45] [Unlike her usual self, Yuuri was dead serious.]
218: 7400| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 7403| [45] ["That's..."]
220: 7429| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 7432| [45] ["I thought I told you back on that day too."]
222: 7465| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 7468| [45] ["Hikorin, the people you should look out for are--"]
224: 7473| [45] [Yuuri's words cut out at that moment.]
225: 7484| [45] [In the sudden silence, the sole sound of a ticking watch rang out.]
226: 7489| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 7490| [45] [(... Back on that day, huh.)]
228: 7495| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 7496| [45] [(On that day when things got awkward between us all...)]
230: 7501| [45] [Natsuhiko already knew...]
231: 7506| [45] [... exactly what time and date his watch would display.]
232: 7722| [45] [As he looked at his watch, it read "9/13" at "6:49".]
