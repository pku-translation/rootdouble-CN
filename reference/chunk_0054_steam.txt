  1:   66| [45] [In the end-- it was Kazami who broke the heavy silence.]
  2:   92| [47] [Kazami]
  3:   95| [45] ["... Let's go over what we -do- know."]
  4:  121| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  124| [45] ["If you had to ask me, I would guess that the girl died trying to escape from here."]
  6:  150| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  153| [45] ["Here's my basis for that."]
  8:  158| [45] [Kazami then took a security card out of her pocket.]
  9:  163| [45] [The name "Shuuya Eriguchi" was on it--]
 10:  168| [45] [As were the words "Lv. N"!]
 11:  176| [47] [Watase]
 12:  179| [45] ["Level N!? Where the hell did you find this!?"]
 13:  184| [45] [It was ranked higher than the "Lv. 6" cards that the group had.]
 14:  210| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  213| [45] ["It was lying right next to that girl's body."]
 16:  239| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  242| [45] ["She probably used this to get all the way over to the cargo lift."]
 18:  269| [47] [Jun]
 19:  272| [45] ["But what was a girl like that doing with such a high leveled card...? Who in the heck was she?"]
 20:  300| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  303| [45] ["H-hmm... perhaps she was a family member of one of the staff here, just like Yuuri...?"]
 22:  329| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  332| [45] ["Whatever the case, she desperately made it all the way over here, but lost all hope when she saw there was no exit, then passed away..."]
 24:  340| [47] [Watase]
 25:  343| [45] ["But if that's how it went down, then who the hell--"]
 26:  351| [47] [Watase]
 27:  354| [45] ["--broke the lift?"]
 28:  359| [45] [Everyone's faces froze over at that question.]
 29:  385| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  388| [45] ["'Broke'...?"]
 31:  396| [47] [Watase]
 32:  399| [45] ["That panel wasn't broken by accident, no matter how you try to spin it. Someone clearly broke that thing intentionally."]
 33:  425| [47] [Jun]
 34:  428| [45] ["Think that girl coulda done it?"]
 35:  436| [47] [Watase]
 36:  439| [45] ["I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's still rather implausible."]
 37:  465| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  468| [45] ["But either way... what would they have had to gain from doing that?"]
 39:  476| [47] [Kazami]
 40:  479| [45] ["The fact that it's destroyed means that whoever the culprit was is still down here."]
 41:  487| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  490| [45] ["But I do not believe there is anyone who would voluntarily wish to be trapped in a place such as this."]
 43:  498| [47] [Watase]
 44:  501| [45] ["That's..."]
 45:  506| [45] [Watase didn't have a clue either.]
 46:  511| [45] [Who in their right mind would be willing to brave the risk of being trapped in this place to the point of cutting off their own escape route?]
 47:  516| [45] [But his thoughts were interrupted by Ena's subdued voice.]
 48:  619| [47] [Ena]
 49:  622| [45] ["... Maybe it was the killer?"]
 50:  675| [47] [Watase]
 51:  678| [45] ["The killer!? Teach, what are you..."]
 52:  686| [47] [Ena]
 53:  689| [45] ["I'm talking about the one who killed that girl."]
 54:  697| [47] [Ena]
 55:  700| [45] ["Whoever it was is most likely the same person who killed those people in Area 3, right?"]
 56:  705| [45] [Watase's mind flashed back for a second to the grotesque sight he'd witnessed in that room.]
 57:  752| [45] [Two of the corpses there had bullet wounds, just like the girl.]
 58:  757| [47] [Watase]
 59:  758| [45] [(... Yeah, it -is- possible that the killer of those people is one and the same...!)]
 60:  786| [47] [Ena]
 61:  789| [45] ["We've all been trying to ignore those three bodies up until this point, haven't we?"]
 62:  797| [47] [Ena]
 63:  800| [45] ["We shelved away any discussion of it by going with the theory that the killer had 'escaped'."]
 64:  808| [47] [Ena]
 65:  811| [45] ["We all figured that we would worry about searching for the killer -after- we get out of here, yes?"]
 66:  838| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  841| [45] ["... Yes."]
 68:  846| [45] [Kazami had sternly told everyone that back when they found the bodies.]
 69:  872| [47] [Ena]
 70:  875| [45] ["But that assumption has been completely invalidated... It would appear that they could not have escaped so easily."]
 71:  883| [47] [Ena]
 72:  886| [45] ["So I'll say it again: this was no mere accident!"]
 73:  891| [45] [Ena's sharp voice echoed in the silent factory.]
 74:  899| [47] [Watase]
 75:  902| [45] ["What's that supposed to mean?"]
 76:  928| [47] [Ena]
 77:  931| [45] ["To see someone who's been shot to death lying next to our escape route means that it's natural to assume that she was shot while trying to escape, right?"]
 78:  939| [47] [Ena]
 79:  942| [45] ["A murder happened right in the basement of a facility that's currently impossible to escape from... then isn't it possible that the killer's the one who created this closed space?"]
 80:  968| [47] [Kazami]
 81:  971| [45] ["Impossible, why would they do that...?"]
 82:  997| [47] [Ena]
 83: 1000| [45] ["Maybe they wanted to kill someone here and therefore stayed behind so they could do it?"]
 84: 1008| [47] [Ena]
 85: 1011| [45] ["For example, if they did it during the lockdown, then all the evidence would go up in flames with the bodies."]
 86: 1019| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1022| [45] ["Cut it out, Teach! That's just speculation! All you're going to do is get people worked up over nothing!"]
 88: 1027| [45] [Watase finally grew sick of Ena's conspiracy theories and objected.]
 89: 1032| [45] [But then Jun cut in.]
 90: 1061| [47] [Jun]
 91: 1064| [45] ["... Hold on a sec, you guys."]
 92: 1090| [47] [Ena]
 93: 1093| [45] ["What?"]
 94: 1125| [47] [Jun]
 95: 1128| [45] ["Well... I didn't think it had anything to do with all of this up until now..."]
 96: 1136| [47] [Jun]
 97: 1139| [45] ["... But recently, it's believed that Rokumei City-- the city where LABO is located--"]
 98: 1147| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1150| [45] ["--may have been invaded by terrorists."]
100: 1158| [47] [Watase]
101: 1161| [45] ["T-terrorists!?"]
102: 1166| [45] [That sudden phrase left Watase in shock.]
103: 1192| [47] [Ena]
104: 1195| [45] ["What's the basis for that?"]
105: 1221| [47] [Jun]
106: 1224| [45] ["... Well, there might not be anything concrete on the matter, but there's been rumors about that floating around."]
107: 1232| [47] [Jun]
108: 1235| [45] ["There's been similar incidents happening in this city recently... and there was this other huge research facility that was bombed only yesterday."]
109: 1261| [47] [Ena]
110: 1264| [45] ["Terrorists targeting a nuclear reactor...!? Yes, that would make sense!"]
111: 1290| [47] [Ena]
112: 1293| [45] ["All those seemingly random explosions and fires, the sprinkler system being suspiciously offline... when you think about it, these are all clearly human acts."]
113: 1301| [47] [Ena]
114: 1304| [45] ["And if all of that were to be capped off by a nuclear reactor blowing up, that would practically be a masterpiece in terms of an 'act of destruction'."]
115: 1309| [45] [If that theory was indeed correct, then it was no surprise that there'd be bullet holes in all those corpses.]
116: 1314| [47] [Watase]
117: 1315| [45] [(If terrorists truly are behind this, that would also explain why so many unnatural situations have kept on piling up...!)]
118: 1320| [45] [But Ukita scoffed.]
119: 1346| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1349| [45] ["... Have you people been watching one too many movies or something?"]
121: 1375| [47] [Jun]
122: 1378| [45] ["Huh!?"]
123: 1404| [47] [Ukita]
124: 1407| [45] ["Terrorists? Seriously? How preposterous. Are you not aware of how strict our security is?"]
125: 1433| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1436| [45] ["Facilities like this that house nuclear reactors have been granted permission to possess security measures beyond the law."]
127: 1444| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1447| [45] ["We have a 24/7 security team comprised of ex-JSDF soldiers equipped with rifles and riot guns."]
129: 1473| [47] [Ukita]
130: 1476| [45] ["Only in fiction could a terrorist hope to even dream of overcoming such defense."]
131: 1502| [47] [Ena]
132: 1505| [45] ["You talk a big game. But your so-called perfect disaster prevention system breaks apart if anyone so much as opens the lid on the whole damn thing."]
133: 1531| [47] [Ukita]
134: 1534| [45] ["...!"]
135: 1560| [47] [Ena]
136: 1563| [45] ["Isn't there any possibility that a terrorist could have taken advantage of a hole in that security and snuck in unnoticed? Are you sure there's no loopholes anywhere?"]
137: 1589| [47] [Ukita]
138: 1592| [45] ["A loophole...!? How the hell would I know something like that!?"]
139: 1618| [47] [Ukita]
140: 1621| [45] ["You're getting obsessed with your little theory and not thinking logically about this!"]
141: 1647| [47] [Ena]
142: 1650| [45] ["Oh really? Then isn't it also a fact that the mysterious girl lying in that room managed to sneak in here somehow?"]
143: 1676| [47] [Ena]
144: 1679| [45] ["Face it, the defense systems you've put so much faith in aren't looking all that reliable at all."]
145: 1705| [47] [Ukita]
146: 1708| [45] ["... Are -you- that intent on having me take responsibility for our facility...!?"]
147: 1713| [45] [Ukita and Ena felt like they were standing right next to a powder keg ready to explode.]
148: 1739| [47] [Yuuri]
149: 1742| [45] ["U-umm, please stop..."]
150: 1747| [45] [Yuuri timidly pleaded to them.]
151: 1752| [45] [But then someone least expected also spoke up.]
152: 1778| [47] [Kazami]
153: 1781| [45] ["... Yes, perhaps we should consider the involvement of terrorists for the time being."]
154: 1807| [47] [Ukita]
155: 1810| [45] ["What!?"]
156: 1836| [47] [Jun]
157: 1839| [45] ["You believe her, Lieutenant!?"]
158: 1865| [47] [Kazami]
159: 1868| [45] ["Yes, somewhat."]
160: 1894| [47] [Kazami]
161: 1897| [45] ["However-- the idea that a terrorist is actually here is merely a hypothesis."]
162: 1923| [47] [Kazami]
163: 1926| [45] ["As I said before, I believe that there's a high probability that the killer escaped before the lockdown commenced."]
164: 1934| [47] [Watase]
165: 1937| [45] ["Huh? What're your grounds for that?"]
166: 1963| [47] [Kazami]
167: 1966| [45] ["Because if the terrorist were trapped here just like us..."]
168: 1974| [47] [Kazami]
169: 1977| [45] ["... then why have we not run into them in the nearly five hours that have passed since the start of the lockdown?"]
170: 2003| [47] [Ena]
171: 2006| [45] ["..."]
172: 2032| [47] [Kazami]
173: 2035| [45] ["If they have a gun, then they could just hold us hostage and take as much AD from us as they liked."]
174: 2061| [47] [Kazami]
175: 2064| [45] ["And yet they have not done so. It doesn't make sense no matter what angle you think about it from. Those are my thoughts on the matter."]
176: 2090| [47] [Ena]
177: 2093| [45] ["But... that person on the radio just now said that there wasn't anyone who'd escaped to the surface with a gun, right? What about that?"]
178: 2119| [47] [Kazami]
179: 2122| [45] ["That only holds water if they didn't simply discard their firearm somewhere."]
180: 2130| [47] [Kazami]
181: 2133| [45] ["What's more, if they slipped into that huge panic that was going on before the lockdown began, they could have escaped whenever they wanted."]
182: 2138| [45] [It was a well-thought out, logical reasoning that befitted someone like Kazami.]
183: 2164| [47] [Yuuri]
184: 2167| [45] ["I-I think you're right..."]
185: 2172| [45] [Yuuri voiced her own opinion, a rather rare occasion to say the least.]
186: 2198| [47] [Jun]
187: 2201| [45] ["Hold on a sec, Lieutenant! Don't you think it's too soon to decide that?"]
188: 2250| [47] [Kazami]
189: 2253| [45] ["And why is that?"]
190: 2279| [47] [Jun]
191: 2282| [45] ["Aren't you the one who's always telling me to always assume the worst when at work!?"]
192: 2290| [47] [Jun]
193: 2293| [45] ["If there's a terrorist down here with us, then we're in a whole different league of danger, right!?"]
194: 2319| [47] [Kazami]
195: 2322| [45] ["Those are completely different matters! We are not detectives!"]
196: 2348| [47] [Ena]
197: 2351| [45] ["But it's important that we consider the possibility."]
198: 2377| [47] [Ukita]
199: 2380| [45] ["Then what are you saying? Are you implying that one of the nine still trapped here is a terrorist?"]
200: 2388| [47] [Ukita]
201: 2391| [45] ["I never took you for the type who would doubt her own students."]
202: 2417| [47] [Ena]
203: 2420| [45] ["Impossi... don't be ridiculous! No one's saying that at all!"]
204: 2446| [47] [Kazami]
205: 2449| [45] ["Then do you mean to say there's a terrorist amongst the six of us? That's even more unlikely."]
206: 2457| [47] [Kazami]
207: 2460| [45] ["If someone full of malice was amongst us, then we would be in far worse straits than we are now."]
208: 2465| [45] [Everyone was voicing their own opinions, and Watase thought they all had their own good points.]
209: 2470| [45] [But having this debate drag on for so long was truly getting unpleasant.]
210: 2478| [47] [Watase]
211: 2481| [45] ["... All right! Let's just all calm down for a minute, guys!"]
212: 2507| [47] [Ena]
213: 2510| [45] ["What's your problem!? You're the only one who hasn't spoken their thoughts on the matter, right!?"]
214: 2518| [47] [Watase]
215: 2521| [45] ["I know that! But let's all rein in our own personal opinions for the time bei--"]
216: 2526| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
217: 2604| [47] [Watase]
218: 2607| [45] ["!"]
219: 2612| [45] [A shock ran through his head.]
220: 2905| [45] [And right after that, countless scenes flashed through his brain.]
221: 2910| [47] [Watase]
222: 2911| [45] [(Wha!?)]
223: 3252| [45] [Watase was confused by this random phenomenon.]
224: 3545| [45] [The events of the last few hours flashed before him.]
225: 3550| [45] [Everything from when he'd woken up in Area 1 to arriving in Area 6.]
226: 3555| [45] [It all streamed past his eyes like a muddy stream for some reason--]
227: 3603| [45] [--and then disappeared.]
228: 3706| [47] [Watase]
229: 3709| [45] ["...?"]
230: 3717| [47] [Ena]
231: 3720| [45] ["H-hey, what's with the sudden silent treatment?"]
232: 3725| [45] [Ena and the others were staring at Watase with wide eyes.]
233: 3730| [45] [But he was so surprised that he was at a complete loss for words.]
234: 3735| [47] [Watase]
235: 3736| [45] [(... What the hell was that...!?)]
236: 3741| [45] [It was clearly bizarre. It wasn't like he'd been reflecting on his memories.%NNo, this was totally different.]
237: 3746| [45] [He'd remembered everything that'd happened up until this point in a second, and in such minute detail at that.]
238: 3751| [45] [And at that exact moment-- he made several connections about a few of the things he'd observed up until now.]
239: 3756| [47] [Watase]
240: 3757| [45] [(Wait a minute...!?)]
241: 3762| [47] [Watase]
242: 3763| [45] [(Let's say there is a terrorist down here...)]
243: 3768| [47] [Watase]
244: 3769| [45] [(Which one of the nine trapped in this facility would be the most likely suspect...?)]
245: 3967| [45] [Suspicions started faintly flaring up in Watase's heart.]
246: 3972| [45] [They swiftly grew bigger.]
247: 3977| [47] [Watase]
248: 3978| [45] [(He said that LABO's security is so strict that no terrorist could ever sneak in...)]
249: 3983| [47] [Watase]
250: 3984| [45] [(But the old man's a staff member here. It would have been easy for him to let a terrorist in...)]
251: 4042| [47] [Watase]
252: 4043| [45] [(Could the "loophole in security" that Teach was talking about be old man Ukita?)]
253: 4048| [47] [Watase]
254: 4049| [45] [(If so, that would explain why he's getting so worked up and so full of denial...)]
255: 4054| [45] [Those doubts begot even more doubts.]
256: 4108| [47] [Watase]
257: 4109| [45] [(What're the odds that the "loophole in security" Teach was talking about could be old man Ukita...?)]
258: 4114| [47] [Watase]
259: 4115| [45] [(No, wait, it's not restricted to the old man. Maybe it was one of the other researchers who's already evacuated.)]
260: 4120| [45] [Those doubts begot even more doubts.]
261: 4143| [47] [Watase]
262: 4144| [45] [(No, what if it's the other way around...? What're the odds that Teach is a terrorist?)]
263: 4149| [47] [Watase]
264: 4150| [45] [(Now that I think about it, her reason for being here is flimsy to begin with...%NWe have no clue if she was really summoned here by a staffer.)]
265: 4208| [45] [Even the assumption that Ena was a "teacher" was solely based off her word and her word alone.]
266: 4213| [45] [He didn't really have much of a reason to trust her.]
267: 4267| [45] [But Watase immediately denied those suspicions.]
268: 4272| [45] [Ena was a normal teacher no matter what angle one viewed her from; there was nothing about her that seemed remotely like a terrorist.]
269: 4310| [47] [Watase]
270: 4311| [45] [(... What about Tachibana and Moribe?)]
271: 4316| [47] [Watase]
272: 4317| [45] [(There's nothing strange about anything they've said and done. They've always acted in the interest of everyone's safety...)]
273: 4330| [47] [Watase]
274: 4331| [45] [(I'm sure I can trust them.)]
275: 4336| [47] [Watase]
276: 4337| [45] [(In fact... isn't the reason that the lockdown is still going on the thing that's fishy here?)]
277: 4342| [47] [Watase]
278: 4343| [45] [(Is it really because of the radiation leakage control system?)]
279: 4351| [47] [Watase]
280: 4352| [45] [(On the other hand, I can't say for sure that I can unconditionally trust them, but...)]
281: 4357| [47] [Watase]
282: 4358| [45] [(... There's something that's bugging me more than that.)]
283: 4363| [47] [Watase]
284: 4364| [45] [(Isn't the reason that the lockdown is still going on the thing that's fishy here?)]
285: 4369| [47] [Watase]
