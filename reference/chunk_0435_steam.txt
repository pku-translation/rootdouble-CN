  0:   66| [45] [--After learning about Yuuri's death--]
  1:   71| [45] [Mashiro cried for a whole day.]
  2:   76| [45] [Even an entire week after she attended Yuuri's funeral--]
  3:   81| [45] [Mashiro still cried each time she remembered it.]
  4:  160| [45] [Mashiro sobbed as she waited for the bus to go to the hospital.]
  5:  165| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  168| [45] ["*sob*... *sob*..."]
  7:  219| [45] [No matter how much she cried, she could not recover from the sadness of losing a dear friend.]
  8:  224| [45] [Yuuri had an ever-gentle smile on her face.]
  9:  229| [45] [Yuuri had told her she was cute, even when nobody else would treat her like a girl.]
 10:  234| [45] [Yuuri had praised her cooking whenever they played house.]
 11:  239| [45] [--Yuuri was the gentlest, cutest girl that Mashiro wanted to be...]
 12:  323| [45] [Mashiro's memories of Yuuri came and went in her mind.]
 13:  328| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  329| [45] [(Hey, Yuuri... it was only about a year ago that we met, huh?)]
 15:  334| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  335| [45] [(I've admired you ever since that day.)]
 17:  340| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  341| [45] [(I thought that if we kept hanging out together, I'd grow up to be a lovely girl just like you...)]
 19:  346| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  347| [45] [(But... I never thought we'd have to say goodbye just a year later...!)]
 21:  355| [45] [And Mashiro could still not believe that she was gone.]
 22:  360| [45] [But even as sadness filled Mashiro's heart, just one other thing remained--]
 23:  365| [45] [Her worry for Natsuhiko.]
 24:  370| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  371| [45] [(... I wonder if Natsuhiko's okay...)]
 26:  376| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't attend Yuuri's funeral.]
 27:  381| [45] [He was apparently still in the hospital. He hadn't come to school at all.]
 28:  386| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  387| [45] [(I gotta go pay him a visit...!)]
 30:  398| [45] [Mashiro wiped her tears as the bus arrived.]
 31:  465| [45] [--As she got off the bus in front of the hospital, Mashiro went through reception and headed to Natsuhiko's room.]
 32:  533| [45] [Inside the hospital room, Natsuhiko was lying on the bed.]
 33:  538| [45] [Beside him was Dr. Tenkawa.]
 34:  543| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  546| [45] ["Professor..."]
 36:  572| [47] [Miyoko]
 37:  575| [45] ["Ah, Mashiro..."]
 38:  601| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  604| [45] ["You came to visit, didn't you? Thank you for taking the time."]
 40:  609| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  612| [45] ["N-no problem..."]
 42:  617| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  620| [45] ["Um, is Natsuhiko... asleep...?"]
 44:  643| [47] [Miyoko]
 45:  644| [45] ["..."]
 46:  670| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  673| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you see..."]
 48:  678| [45] [The professor glanced at Natsuhiko.]
 49:  683| [45] [Mashiro peeked at Natsuhiko's face-- and gasped.]
 50:  883| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  886| [45] ["!!"]
 52:  891| [45] [He wasn't sleeping.]
 53:  901| [45] [He was lying down with his eyes wide open.]
 54:  906| [45] [But there was no light in those eyes. He just stared blankly at the air.]
 55:  911| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  914| [45] ["... Natsuhiko?"]
 57:  919| [45] [No answer.]
 58:  924| [47] [Mashiro]
 59:  927| [45] ["Natsuhiko."]
 60:  932| [45] [No answer.]
 61:  937| [47] [Mashiro]
 62:  940| [45] ["H-hey! What's wrong, Natsuhiko!?"]
 63:  945| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  948| [45] ["Can't you hear me!? Hey!"]
 65:  953| [45] [As Mashiro shouted in confusion, Dr. Tenkawa answered in her son's stead.]
 66:  958| [47] [Miyoko]
 67:  961| [45] ["... He can't hear you."]
 68:  966| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  969| [45] ["Huh?"]
 70:  974| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  977| [45] ["He's been like that ever since he learned about Yuuri's death..."]
 72:  982| [47] [Miyoko]
 73:  985| [45] ["It's not just you, Mashiro. He won't respond to anyone... not me, nor the doctors."]
 74:  990| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  993| [45] ["He couldn't come to terms with the truth... and he shut his mind away..."]
 76:  998| [47] [Mashiro]
 77: 1001| [45] ["... No..."]
 78: 1046| [45] [Mashiro looked at Natsuhiko in blank amazement.]
 79: 1051| [45] [His gaze pointed off somewhere far into the distance...]
 80: 1101| [45] [--Mashiro left the hospital in disbelief.]
 81: 1167| [45] [As she headed home, her head swirled with various thoughts and feelings.]
 82: 1172| [45] [But the strongest feeling of them all-- was regret.]
 83: 1177| [47] [Mashiro]
 84: 1178| [45] [(... Yuuri went to LABO in my stead and died because of it...)]
 85: 1183| [47] [Mashiro]
 86: 1184| [45] [(That's why Natsuhiko's like that...)]
 87: 1189| [45] [Mashiro's heart was torn apart by the regret of what she could never undo.]
 88: 1194| [45] [She couldn't think of a way to dispel that regret--]
 89: 1199| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1200| [45] [(At least until Natsuhiko returns to normal, I'll...!)]
 91: 1205| [45] [She resolved to put everything she had into watching over Natsuhiko.]
 92: 1210| [45] [She didn't care if she was merely serving as a replacement for Yuuri or about anything else.]
 93: 1215| [45] [Mashiro swore to herself that she would watch over him.]
