  1:   56| [45] [------]
  2:   61| [45] [----]
  3:   66| [45] [--]
  4:  130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  131| [45] [(--...!)]
  6:  136| [45] [--Natsuhiko returned to reality once more.]
  7:  141| [45] [What he first saw was Watase.]
  8:  146| [45] [He had collapsed onto the floor face-down.]
  9:  154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  157| [45] ["C... Captain Kasasagi!?"]
 11:  162| [47] [Watase]
 12:  163| [45] ["..."]
 13:  168| [45] [Watase seemed to have fainted after Natsuhiko had erased his memory.]
 14:  173| [45] [When Natsuhiko tried to shake him awake--]
 15:  181| [47] [Watase]
 16:  184| [45] ["... Guh... ugh...!"]
 17:  228| [45] [Watase got up with a groan.]
 18:  251| [45] [And then he glared at Natsuhiko.]
 19:  256| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  257| [45] [(The malice didn't disappear!?)]
 21:  262| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly covered Yuuri.]
 22:  267| [45] [But-- Watase muttered in confusion.]
 23:  293| [47] [Watase]
 24:  296| [45] ["Wha... what happened...?"]
 25:  304| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  307| [45] ["'What happened'--?"]
 27:  335| [47] [Watase]
 28:  338| [45] ["I hated your guts just a second ago... but that hatred suddenly disappeared?"]
 29:  368| [45] [At those words, Natsuhiko and Yuuri looked at each other.]
 30:  376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  379| [45] ["We did it... It worked!"]
 32:  411| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  414| [45] ["Yeah! Captain Kasasagi's finally free from the malice!"]
 34:  447| [47] [Watase]
 35:  450| [45] ["H-hey! What do you mean, 'free from the malice'?"]
 36:  476| [47] [Watase]
 37:  479| [45] ["Explain what's going on!"]
 38:  487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  490| [45] ["Well, actually--"]
 40:  535| [45] [Natsuhiko explained the circumstances to the dumbfounded Watase.]
 41:  540| [45] [What they had learned from his memories. What had happened inside his brain.]
 42:  545| [45] [How Subject N had manipulated his memories and infected him with malice...]
 43:  569| [45] [After Watase had heard it all, he took a deep breath and spoke.]
 44:  577| [47] [Watase]
 45:  580| [45] ["... So that's what happened, huh."]
 46:  588| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  591| [45] ["So... how are you feeling, Captain Kasasagi?"]
 48:  617| [47] [Watase]
 49:  620| [45] ["... Like I just woke up from a long nightmare."]
 50:  646| [47] [Watase]
 51:  649| [45] ["But in any case, my memory's mostly returned to normal and the hatred ruling my mind's gone too."]
 52:  654| [45] [Watase's tone of voice was calm and composed. The madness had faded from his eyes.]
 53:  681| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  684| [45] ["Thank goodness...!"]
 55:  689| [45] [Yuuri sighed in relief and Natsuhiko felt a weight off his shoulders as well.]
 56:  694| [45] [Everything seemed to be good, considering Watase had returned to his original self brimming with a sense of justice.]
 57:  702| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  705| [45] ["Then... can I ask for your cooperation?"]
 59:  737| [47] [Watase]
 60:  740| [45] ["My cooperation?"]
 61:  748| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  751| [45] ["I want your cooperation to protect Yuuri and aid in her escape."]
 63:  759| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  762| [45] ["I want to set Yuuri free."]
 65:  785| [47] [Watase]
 66:  786| [45] ["..."]
 67:  809| [45] [A suspenseful silence spread through the shelter once more.]
 68:  814| [45] [Finally, Watase made up his mind and spoke up.]
 69:  842| [47] [Watase]
 70:  845| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Natsuhiko. I can't do that."]
 71:  871| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  874| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 73:  900| [47] [Yuuri]
 74:  903| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, why...?"]
 75:  935| [47] [Watase]
 76:  938| [45] ["Even if my malice has disappeared, now that I have my memories back... I'm still part of 'Q'."]
 77:  943| [45] [Natsuhiko twitched at those words.]
 78:  948| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Watase's goal wasn't just to rescue the test subjects.]
 79:  953| [45] [His end goal was strictly to use the test subjects as living witnesses against LABO's crimes against humanity.]
 80:  958| [45] [But if that were the case, then that meant that even if Yuuri escaped, it didn't necessarily mean she was free, naturally.]
 81:  963| [45] [It was most likely that Q would take custody of her and have her cooperate with their activities.]
 82:  968| [45] [As Natsuhiko realized that possibility, Watase continued.]
 83:  976| [47] [Watase]
 84:  979| [45] ["I have a mission. A mission I must carry out no matter what."]
 85:  987| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86:  990| [45] ["Kidnapping Yuuri?"]
 87: 1016| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1019| [45] ["Yeah."]
 89: 1045| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1048| [45] ["No, you can't mean that...!"]
 91: 1074| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1077| [45] ["You're really a gentle person on the inside, so why must you persist in such a thing?"]
 93: 1085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1088| [45] ["Exactly! I don't care how you sugarcoat it by calling it a mission. That doesn't change how it's terrorism!"]
 95: 1114| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1117| [45] ["I understand that."]
 97: 1125| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1128| [45] ["No, you don't understand at all. While your memories were gone, you desperately tried to save everyone, didn't you?"]
 99: 1136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1139| [45] ["That was who you are by nature."]
101: 1147| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1150| [45] ["I'm sure that was the true you. The one who succeeded Wataru's dying wish to become a rescue worker!"]
103: 1176| [47] [Watase]
104: 1179| [45] ["Don't say that name like you knew her. You think you understand me?"]
105: 1187| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1190| [45] ["Of course I do. Our minds were once one, after all!"]
107: 1213| [45] [Watase's eyes widened at those words.]
108: 1221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1224| [45] ["You wanted to save lives, didn't you? That desire was always on your mind ever since Wataru's death."]
110: 1250| [47] [Watase]
111: 1253| [45] ["... Yeah."]
112: 1261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1264| [45] ["So please, just forget about your terrorist mission or whatever. You can still start over again, can't--"]
114: 1269| [45] [Watase interrupted Natsuhiko with a depressed murmur.]
115: 1295| [47] [Watase]
116: 1298| [45] ["Maybe if my comrades hadn't died."]
117: 1321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1324| [45] ["...!"]
119: 1381| [47] [Watase]
120: 1384| [45] ["... Two of my comrades died for this mission."]
121: 1438| [47] [Watase]
122: 1441| [45] ["Those two-- Dojima and Hiyama-- were precious squadmates to me."]
123: 1495| [47] [Watase]
124: 1498| [45] ["We shared the same kind of upbringing, we shared the same job, we shared the same meals, and we saved each other's necks time and time again."]
125: 1506| [47] [Watase]
126: 1509| [45] ["'Friends' doesn't even begin to describe them. We were kindred souls. Partners. Family--..."]
127: 1563| [47] [Watase]
128: 1566| [45] ["... So you see, Natsuhiko, I have to fulfill this mission. If I don't, they'll have died for nothing."]
129: 1571| [45] [Watase's sad words left Natsuhiko speechless.]
130: 1576| [45] [But even so, he squeezed out an earnest reply.]
131: 1584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1587| [45] ["You're... wrong."]
133: 1622| [47] [Watase]
134: 1625| [45] ["How can you say I'm wrong? You saw my past, didn't you?"]
135: 1633| [47] [Watase]
136: 1636| [45] ["Then you should be able to understand why I'm resorting to all this."]
137: 1644| [47] [Watase]
138: 1647| [45] ["Conventional methods won't change a goddamn thing."]
139: 1652| [45] [Watase was right.]
140: 1657| [45] [Natsuhiko understood Watase's feelings. Whether he wanted to or not.]
141: 1662| [45] [However--]
142: 1695| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1696| [45] [(But still... he really has changed...)]
144: 1701| [45] [Regardless of whether or not he was affected by the malice contagion, once Watase had regained his memory, the "amnesiac Watase" had disappeared.]
145: 1706| [45] [But at that moment, Yuuri spoke up.]
146: 1714| [47] [Yuuri]
147: 1717| [45] ["I understand your point..."]
148: 1746| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Yuuri in shock as she made a brooding face.]
149: 1754| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 1757| [45] ["Let's make a deal, Captain Kasasagi."]
151: 1790| [47] [Watase]
152: 1793| [45] ["A deal?"]
153: 1801| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 1804| [45] ["Yes. Once this incident is over--"]
155: 1812| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 1815| [45] ["I'll entrust myself to your care."]
157: 1841| [47] [Natsuhiko & Watase]
158: 1844| [45] ["What!?"]
159: 1852| [47] [Yuuri]
160: 1855| [45] ["Hand me over to Q or whatever you please."]
161: 1863| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 1866| [45] ["But in return, cooperate to make sure everyone escapes."]
163: 1874| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 1877| [45] ["Wh... what are you saying, Yuuri!?"]
165: 1882| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to stop her, but Yuuri wouldn't pull back.]
166: 1908| [47] [Yuuri]
167: 1911| [45] ["It's okay, Hikorin."]
168: 1919| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 1922| [45] ["If I endure this, then nobody else has to get hurt..."]
170: 1927| [45] [Yuuri spoke with a smile.]
171: 1932| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 1933| [45] [(No... there's no way I can approve of this deal!)]
173: 1938| [45] [But Natsuhiko could think of no other way to earn Watase's cooperation.]
174: 1943| [45] [Natsuhiko fell silent as Watase spoke up in a low voice.]
175: 1969| [47] [Watase]
176: 1972| [45] ["Yuuri, I accept your deal."]
177: 1980| [47] [Watase]
178: 1983| [45] ["I promise to get everyone out of here alive."]
179: 2009| [47] [Yuuri]
180: 2012| [45] ["Please do, Captain Kasasagi."]
181: 2017| [45] [The deal was made without Natsuhiko having a say in any of it.]
182: 2022| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2023| [45] [(D-dammit... What do I do...!?)]
184: 2028| [45] [Even if the two of them had consented to the deal, there was no way he could just sit back and watch as Watase took Yuuri away.]
185: 2033| [45] [By no means could Natsuhiko turn a blind eye.]
186: 2143| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 2144| [45] [(I-I guess I've got no choice... If Watase insists on prioritizing that mission of his, then...!)]
188: 2155| [45] [--Then there was a way to put a stop to him.]
189: 2166| [45] [Indeed. There was something Natsuhiko could do.]
190: 2177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2178| [45] [(... If I just erase Watase's memory one more time...)]
192: 2189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2190| [45] [(If I turn him back into an "amnesiac rescue worker unaware that he's really a terrorist"--!)]
194: 2275| [45] [--But on the other hand--]
195: 2280| [45] [His mind hazed with the question of "is this really okay?"]
196: 2331| [45] [Natsuhiko had erased Watase's memory multiple times before.]
197: 2336| [45] [The damage from the erasures had accumulated, leaving Watase's brain at what might be its limit.]
198: 2341| [45] [So if Natsuhiko erased his memories one more time-- it could quite possibly be fatal.]
199: 2346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2347| [45] [(But that's... the only way I can save Yuuri...)]
201: 2432| [45] [He could think of no other method.]
202: 2437| [45] [So at the end of his inner conflict, he was able to justify his conclusion.]
203: 2442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 2443| [45] [(... It's okay. It's okay... I'm sure Watase's brain can withstand just one more erasure.)]
205: 2448| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 2449| [45] [(Besides, it'd be for the best for Watase's sake as well...)]
207: 2454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2455| [45] [(Because at heart, he's not a terrorist, but a rescue worker...!)]
209: 2570| [45] [When he had lost his memories, Watase was a man among men who risked his life to save others.]
210: 2575| [45] [And he was the same way before he had learned the truth behind his family's death and joined Q for revenge.]
211: 2580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 2581| [45] [(So, once everything's over... I'll erase Watase's memory as a terrorist, returning him to how he was "originally".)]
213: 2586| [45] [And Watase will finally be free from all wicked intentions.]
214: 2602| [45] [Natsuhiko decided to believe his plan was the right thing to do.]
215: 2607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2608| [45] [(... Besides, Watase might change his mind before we get out of LABO.)]
217: 2613| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2614| [45] [(It's a low possibility, but... let's just hope for the best.)]
219: 2619| [45] [And with that in mind, Natsuhiko called out to Watase.]
220: 2631| [45] [--As soon as that idea crossed Natsuhiko's mind--]
221: 2675| [45] [A feeling in the deepest depths of his mind welled up to refuse it.]
222: 2680| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 2681| [45] [(!?)]
224: 2686| [45] [That feeling snapped Natsuhiko back to his senses.]
225: 2741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2742| [45] [(Wha...! Wh-what was I... What was I thinking!?)]
227: 2747| [45] [Natsuhiko started trembling at the realization of just how terrifying his own thoughts were.]
228: 2752| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 2753| [45] [(... There's no way I can do that. Even if Watase's a terrorist...!)]
230: 2772| [45] [And besides, inside Watase's brain, Subject N had said this:]
231: 2843| [47] [Subject N]
232: 2846| [45] ["You use inhuman abilities to your heart's content to stomp on others. You know what they call a being like that?"]
233: 2873| [47] [Subject N]
234: 2876| [45] ["A monster, that's what."]
235: 2892| [47] [Natsuhiko]
236: 2893| [45] [(That's right. If I erase Watase's memory now... that makes me a "monster".)]
237: 2898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 2899| [45] [(So I mustn't... I'm not a monster. I'm a human being...!)]
239: 2904| [45] [Natsuhiko strictly forbade himself from abusing his abilities.]
240: 2909| [45] [Even if he had the power to distort people's memory at will-- there was no way he would ever use that power.]
241: 3024| [45] [... But in that case, what would he do? How could he protect Yuuri?]
242: 3029| [45] [He could not find an answer.]
243: 3052| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 3053| [45] [(Dammit... I can't think of anything...!)]
245: 3058| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 3059| [45] [(At least I can hope that Watase changes his mind between now and until we get out of LABO...)]
247: 3075| [45] [Natsuhiko was frustrated that he could do nothing more.]
248: 3080| [45] [He was honestly not at all confident that he had chosen the right path.]
249: 3085| [45] [As Natsuhiko wallowed in hesitation and hopelessness, Watase called out to him.]
250: 3112| [47] [Watase]
251: 3115| [45] ["... Why so quiet? Can't accept that I'll be taking Yuuri with me?"]
252: 3123| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 3126| [45] ["Of course I can't accept that. It's just... there's no time to argue about it now."]
254: 3134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3137| [45] ["I'll just go along with it for now. The deal's meaningless if we're all dead, after all..."]
256: 3163| [47] [Watase]
257: 3166| [45] ["..."]
258: 3174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3177| [45] ["Anyway, we don't have any time. Let's plan out our next course of action."]
260: 3203| [47] [Watase]
261: 3206| [45] ["... Yeah. I got my memories back now, so let's think things over once more."]
262: 3233| [47] [Yuuri]
263: 3236| [45] ["To come up with a way to ensure everyone's escape, right?"]
264: 3267| [45] [The three of them nodded and came face to face.]
265: 3299| [47] [Watase]
266: 3302| [45] ["To ensure everyone's escape, first we need to do -something- about the ones that went crazy."]
267: 3310| [47] [Watase]
268: 3313| [45] ["So first of all, as for the reason why they all went crazy to begin with--"]
269: 3318| [45] [It was a mystery up until recently, but now they knew.]
270: 3326| [47] [Natsuhiko]
271: 3329| [45] ["It's probably safe to assume that Subject N manipulated all of their memories just like she did to you, Captain Kasasagi."]
272: 3355| [47] [Watase]
273: 3358| [45] ["Judging from what happened to me, just getting close to that girl is enough for her to rewrite your memories into a jumbled mess and plant malice inside your head."]
274: 3412| [45] [Subject N was most likely a Communicator with tremendous power.]
275: 3417| [45] [She was an IGF2R Gene Abnormality Type S Communicator whose ability was equal to or perhaps even greater than Natsuhiko's and Yuuri's.]
276: 3468| [45] [Everyone who got too close to her became filled with malice.]
277: 3519| [45] [As if her malice truly "infected" them.]
278: 3527| [47] [Watase]
279: 3530| [45] ["So based on that, when do you think everyone else got infected with Subject N's malice?"]
280: 3535| [45] [Watase, his comrades, and the researchers got infected when they encountered Subject N in Area Zero.]
281: 3585| [45] [But Jun and the others only saw Subject N's dead body. She shouldn't have had a chance to infect them.]
282: 3593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 3596| [45] ["Yuuri, about how far do you think Subject N's Senses Sympathy range was?"]
284: 3628| [47] [Yuuri]
285: 3631| [45] ["Just a guess, but... probably around 6 m, I think."]
286: 3657| [47] [Yuuri]
287: 3660| [45] ["That's what the professor said a long time ago."]
288: 3668| [47] [Yuuri]
289: 3671| [45] ["'There's another test subject with stronger abilities', 'her Senses Sympathy range is 6 m'."]
290: 3697| [47] [Yuuri]
291: 3700| [45] ["In the absence of the melt effect, I personally have a range of 1 m at best, so I'd think the limit is maybe around there."]
292: 3708| [47] [Natsuhiko]
293: 3711| [45] ["I see. So that's how it is..."]
294: 3764| [45] [True enough, Natsuhiko himself couldn't use Senses Sympathy unless his target was close enough to touch them.]
295: 3769| [45] [In that case, Subject N shouldn't have been able to manipulate the others' memories from a distance.]
296: 3801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 3804| [45] ["Just asking, but were there any other Communicators confined in LABO besides you and Subject N, Yuuri?"]
298: 3830| [47] [Yuuri]
299: 3833| [45] ["... No. There were only two test subjects, just like what you learned from Captain Kasasagi's memories."]
300: 3841| [47] [Natsuhiko]
301: 3844| [45] ["Then the root of the problem must be Subject N, huh... So when were Jun and the others infected with malice?"]
302: 3849| [45] [Watase quietly answered Natsuhiko's question.]
303: 3906| [47] [Watase]
304: 3909| [45] ["... I think... I might have a hunch."]
305: 3917| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 3920| [45] ["A hunch?"]
307: 3946| [47] [Watase]
308: 3949| [45] ["You've seen all of my actions so far, right Natsuhiko? So you should know."]
309: 3957| [47] [Watase]
310: 3960| [45] ["We found Subject N's body several hours ago by the cargo lift, remember?"]
311: 4017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
312: 4020| [45] ["Yeah, but what about it...?"]
313: 4028| [47] [Watase]
314: 4031| [45] ["All six of us were there at the time."]
315: 4039| [47] [Watase]
316: 4042| [45] ["And it was after that when everyone went crazy. The timing fits."]
317: 4050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
318: 4053| [45] ["But a dead body using BC...?"]
319: 4061| [47] [Watase]
320: 4064| [45] ["What if Subject N wasn't dead yet?"]
321: 4072| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 4075| [45] ["!?"]
323: 4105| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head.]
324: 4113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
325: 4116| [45] ["That can't be... Ms. Tachibana confirmed her death, didn't she?"]
326: 4124| [47] [Watase]
327: 4127| [45] ["That's right. Her body was pretty much dead, that's for sure."]
328: 4153| [47] [Watase]
329: 4156| [45] ["But what if that was just right after her pulse and other vital signs had ceased... and her consciousness was still barely there?"]
330: 4164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
331: 4167| [45] ["... Huh?"]
332: 4172| [45] [Natsuhiko was surprised for a second-- but then he realized it certainly was a possibility.]
333: 4177| [45] [When using Senses Sympathy, all vital signs drop dramatically.]
334: 4182| [45] [So much so that they could possibly go undetected by the Vital Checker.]
335: 4208| [47] [Watase]
336: 4211| [45] ["... Furthermore, that happened right when it was time for us to administer AD again."]
337: 4219| [47] [Watase]
338: 4222| [45] ["In other words, there was a window where 'AD had worn off'."]
339: 4248| [47] [Watase]
340: 4251| [45] ["I quickly administered AD to me, Yuuri, and Teach when the time came, but--"]
341: 4277| [47] [Watase]
342: 4280| [45] ["Tachibana and the others were busy with CPR, so they injected themselves late."]
343: 4288| [47] [Watase]
344: 4291| [45] ["So if you think about it, that would explain why Tachibana, Moribe, and old man Ukita were infected with malice, but the rest of us weren't."]
345: 4296| [45] [... So at the verge of death, Subject N used the last of her strength to spread her malice into her surroundings...]
346: 4304| [47] [Natsuhiko]
347: 4307| [45] ["She was on the verge of death yet she destroyed several people's personalities without letting any of them be aware of it...!?"]
348: 4333| [47] [Watase]
349: 4336| [45] ["Now I can understand why those high ranked researchers were afraid-- That truly is an 'uncontrollable monster'."]
350: 4344| [47] [Watase]
351: 4347| [45] ["Basically, 'Case N' is the code to prevent her escape, right?"]
352: 4413| [45] [Now that he mentioned it, she described her condition as being "N-ified".]
353: 4418| [45] [The N standing for "Nobody", or perhaps "Nucleus".]
354: 4441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
355: 4442| [45] [(She was designated "Subject N"... truly a fitting name for her.)]
356: 4447| [45] [But what frightened Natsuhiko the most wasn't the strength of her ability.]
357: 4452| [45] [It was Subject N's "malice" itself in how it corroded the minds of every human around her.]
358: 4520| [47] [Yuuri]
359: 4523| [45] ["Then, could it be..."]
360: 4531| [47] [Yuuri]
361: 4534| [45] ["That the bulkheads are under lockdown not to prevent my escape, but hers...?"]
362: 4542| [47] [Natsuhiko]
363: 4545| [45] ["Yeah... judging by the situation, it does seem very likely."]
364: 4550| [45] [Now that Natsuhiko thought about it, Subject N freely walking around a WX particle irradiated LABO would indeed be the worst case scenario.]
365: 4555| [45] [Without AD, there would be no way to stop her BC.]
366: 4563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
367: 4566| [45] ["Yuuri, did Mom or anyone else ever mention anything about how dangerous Subject N was?"]
368: 4592| [47] [Yuuri]
369: 4595| [45] ["N-no, I haven't heard a thing!"]
370: 4621| [47] [Yuuri]
371: 4624| [45] ["I knew I wasn't the only test subject, but... LABO policy prohibits test subjects from meeting each other."]
372: 4632| [47] [Yuuri]
373: 4635| [45] ["I always wanted to meet her since we've grown up in the same environment, but... I never thought she'd be this dangerous...!"]
374: 4662| [47] [Watase]
375: 4665| [45] ["I see... The reason why you were prohibited contact with Subject N was probably to avoid you getting infected by her malice."]
376: 4697| [47] [Watase]
377: 4700| [45] ["Dojima probably got infected by malice-- and shot Subject N in his madness."]
378: 4705| [45] [Now that Watase mentioned it, Natsuhiko remembered the tragic scene they saw in Area 3.]
379: 4761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
380: 4764| [45] ["Two other people besides your comrades died in that room, right? Those researcher-looking guys."]
381: 4772| [47] [Watase]
382: 4775| [45] ["Well, I dunno about them."]
383: 4783| [47] [Watase]
384: 4786| [45] ["Maybe some researchers happened to be present when the malice-infected Dojima tried to shoot Subject N, and they tried to stop him--"]
385: 4794| [47] [Watase]
386: 4797| [45] ["Or maybe the researchers were infected with malice too, and they all tried to kill each other."]
387: 4851| [47] [Natsuhiko]
388: 4854| [45] ["What about 'Hiyama'? His legs were broken, but he died in a different location."]
389: 4862| [47] [Watase]
390: 4865| [45] ["Maybe N got away, so he tried to chase her down and kill her?"]
391: 4873| [47] [Watase]
392: 4876| [45] ["But along the way, his legs broke and he got burned to death..."]
393: 4881| [45] [Which would make Subject N the root of his death as well.]
394: 4949| [47] [Natsuhiko]
395: 4950| [45] [(Did Subject N harbor so much malice as to cause all those tragedies...!?)]
396: 4955| [45] [If that were the case, then Jun and Ukita could start killing each other too.]
397: 4960| [45] [Everyone was already in a critical situation.]
398: 4965| [45] [Balance was being barely maintained by how the brunt of everyone's anger was directed towards Watase.]
399: 4973| [47] [Natsuhiko]
400: 4976| [45] ["We need to do something quick...!"]
401: 5010| [47] [Watase]
402: 5013| [45] ["Yeah. There's also the matter of the bomb set in Area Zero."]
403: 5021| [47] [Watase]
404: 5024| [45] ["It's set to go off right after the lockdown lifts."]
405: 5032| [47] [Watase]
406: 5035| [45] ["So if we all want to survive, we need to escape as soon as the bulkheads open."]
407: 5061| [47] [Watase]
408: 5064| [45] ["I really regret our actions in that regard..."]
409: 5090| [47] [Yuuri]
410: 5093| [45] ["There's no point apologizing about it now. Let's focus on finding out how to evacuate everyone safely now."]
411: 5098| [45] [Yuuri spoke in an oddly strict tone of voice for her.]
412: 5103| [45] [It seemed even she could get angry. Watase answered with a bitter look on his face.]
413: 5129| [47] [Watase]
414: 5132| [45] ["Sorry. You're right... I plan to do everything I can to ensure our escape."]
415: 5140| [47] [Watase]
416: 5143| [45] ["Before the bomb goes off, let's capture everyone, tie them up, and wait for the bulkheads to open."]
417: 5151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
418: 5154| [45] ["I'd love to... but that seems a little difficult."]
419: 5159| [45] [Carrying several bound people out of LABO seemed like an impossible task.]
420: 5285| [45] [Furthermore, Ukita, Jun, and Kazami were all armed.]
421: 5367| [45] [And their party included two wounded kids and a girl. The only one with a fighting chance was Watase.]
422: 5372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
423: 5373| [45] [(But even so, we have to do it...!)]
424: 5390| [45] [Natsuhiko resolved himself.]
425: 5420| [45] [When he looked at Yuuri, she too had a look of determination on her face.]
426: 5428| [47] [Yuuri]
427: 5431| [45] ["... Hikorin, I'll join you...!"]
428: 5462| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and addressed Watase.]
429: 5470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
430: 5473| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... can you bring us to everyone else?"]
431: 5499| [47] [Watase]
432: 5502| [45] ["Mm, what's your plan?"]
433: 5510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 5513| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? We're going to remove everyone's malice and return them to their original selves."]
435: 5539| [47] [Watase]
436: 5542| [45] ["Can you pull it off? That means you'll have to fight that monster that was inside my mind again and again."]
437: 5550| [47] [Natsuhiko]
438: 5553| [45] ["We don't have a choice. Sure, I'll have to confront her again and again, and my mind may be corroded by the malice..."]
439: 5561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
440: 5564| [45] ["But it's an indispensable step for everyone's escape. I want to save everyone. Not just Yuuri."]
441: 5587| [45] [Watase furrowed his eyebrows at Natsuhiko's answer.]
442: 5595| [47] [Watase]
443: 5598| [45] ["I see... but still, there's no need for you two to come with me. I'll leave the shelter alone and bring everyone here."]
444: 5606| [47] [Natsuhiko]
445: 5609| [45] ["You'll what?"]
446: 5635| [47] [Watase]
447: 5638| [45] ["It's suicide to walk around the facility with those wounds of yours, and it's dangerous to take Yuuri too. It's best you kids stay here."]
448: 5646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
449: 5649| [45] ["I see..."]
450: 5654| [45] [True enough, nobody else knew about the shelter's existence but Ukita.]
451: 5659| [45] [So long as they captured him, they would be safe in there.]
452: 5667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
453: 5670| [45] ["... So basically, you'll take everyone to the shelter and Yuuri and I will remove their malice.%NWe repeat that plan until we've gotten everyone, correct?"]
454: 5696| [47] [Watase]
455: 5699| [45] ["Exactly."]
456: 5704| [45] [All three of them were necessary for this plan. Natsuhiko, Yuuri, and Watase. If any one of them were to betray the others, the plan would fail.]
457: 5709| [45] [Natsuhiko held that thought as the conversation continued.]
458: 5717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
459: 5720| [45] ["... Good grief. Looks like we're in the same boat again, huh."]
460: 5746| [47] [Watase]
461: 5749| [45] ["Yeah. If you and I don't cooperate, then the plan to return everyone back to normal's a bust."]
462: 5757| [47] [Natsuhiko]
463: 5760| [45] ["Yeah. I'm a little concerned that you'll betray us, though..."]
464: 5765| [45] [Yuuri tugged on Natsuhiko's sleeve when he said that.]
465: 5798| [47] [Yuuri]
466: 5801| [45] ["It's okay, Hikorin. I'm sure he'll pull through for us."]
467: 5827| [47] [Yuuri]
468: 5830| [45] ["Let's believe in 'Captain Kasasagi'."]
469: 5835| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart ached at those words.]
470: 5840| [45] [Obviously, he understood. He knew that Watase was, by nature, a trustworthy human being.]
471: 5845| [45] [Regardless of his mission or status as a terrorist, he would surely honor his promise to protect Natsuhiko and Yuuri.]
472: 5850| [45] [No, even without that promise, he may have already been considering how to get everyone out of there alive.]
473: 5880| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed and spoke to Watase.]
474: 5888| [47] [Natsuhiko]
475: 5891| [45] ["... Hey, Captain Kasasagi. I hate you."]
476: 5917| [47] [Watase]
477: 5920| [45] ["What?"]
478: 5942| [47] [Natsuhiko]
479: 5945| [45] ["Shouldn't it be obvious? Though it may be for your mission, there's no way I'd like someone who's going to take Yuuri away."]
480: 5953| [47] [Natsuhiko]
481: 5956| [45] ["I dove through your memory over and over again to free you from your malice... How ungrateful can you get?"]
482: 5982| [47] [Watase]
483: 5985| [45] ["... Maybe you're right. I am thankful for what you've done, and I know the matter with Yuuri is inexcusable."]
484: 6011| [47] [Watase]
485: 6014| [45] ["But don't worry. I don't like you either."]
486: 6022| [47] [Watase]
487: 6025| [45] ["You mess around inside people's heads and change things however you please... Do you know how much trouble you put me through?"]
488: 6033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
489: 6036| [45] ["Sure. I saw how hard you worked. I saw everything. But you had it coming, you know?"]
490: 6062| [47] [Watase]
491: 6065| [45] ["Mmgh... I guess you're right. I kinda stirred up a hornet's nest there."]
492: 6070| [45] [The two of them faintly smiled as they held that conversation.]
493: 6075| [45] [They were badmouthing each other, yet there was a somewhat friendly mood between them.]
494: 6084| [47] [Natsuhiko]
495: 6087| [45] ["Shouldn't it be obvious?"]
496: 6095| [47] [Natsuhiko]
497: 6098| [45] ["While you may have been infected with malice, you did try to kill us just because we're Communicators."]
498: 6106| [47] [Natsuhiko]
499: 6109| [45] ["Furthermore, though it may be for your mission, there's no way I'd like someone who's going to take Yuuri away."]
500: 6135| [47] [Watase]
501: 6138| [45] ["... Maybe you're right. That is inexcusable."]
502: 6164| [47] [Watase]
503: 6167| [45] ["But don't worry. I don't like you either."]
504: 6175| [47] [Watase]
505: 6178| [45] ["You mess around inside people's heads and change things however you please... Do you know how much trouble you put me through?"]
506: 6186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
507: 6189| [45] ["Gh... I guess that was a little inexcusable of me, huh."]
508: 6212| [45] [The two of them faintly smiled as they held that conversation.]
509: 6217| [45] [--Right now, Natsuhiko and Watase were completely mismatched.]
510: 6222| [45] [But there was something they needed to do that neither of them could do alone.]
511: 6227| [45] [Something they needed to join forces to do.]
512: 6232| [45] [And as they shared in that joint role, they both shared a smile.]
513: 6240| [47] [Natsuhiko]
514: 6243| [45] ["... Captain Kasasagi. From here on out, we're equals. Let's each fulfill our roles to the best of our ability."]
515: 6269| [47] [Watase]
516: 6272| [45] ["Of course."]
517: 6280| [47] [Watase]
518: 6283| [45] ["Oh, and... drop the formalities. Let's be casual here."]
519: 6288| [45] [At Watase's request, Natsuhiko responded in the tone he had always been using when speaking inside Watase's head.]
520: 6296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
521: 6299| [45] ["Got it... We're counting on you, 'Watase'."]
522: 6325| [47] [Watase]
523: 6328| [45] ["Yeah, leave it to me."]
524: 6333| [45] [And with that exchange, Natsuhiko and Watase made a firm handshake.]
