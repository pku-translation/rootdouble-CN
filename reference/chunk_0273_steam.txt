  1:   63| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself disgusted by Watase's word choice.]
  2:   68| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   69| [45] [(Allies, huh... I can't say I completely agree with that word--)]
  4:   92| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:   93| [45] [(--but Watase certainly is the one I can trust the most right now.)]
  6:  100| [45] [--Indeed. Natsuhiko had the best seat in the house to witness the amnesiac Watase's desperate struggle. So he could attest to his reliability.]
  7:  105| [45] [Now that they were face-to-face like this, things could finally begin.]
  8:  144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  145| [45] [(Let's investigate each matter one at a time, including whether or not a "monster" exists here...)]
 10:  150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  151| [45] [(First, what's the current situation? Who's friend and who's foe?)]
 12:  156| [45] [Could Natsuhiko consider anyone else an ally besides Watase?]
 13:  208| [45] [At the very least, Salyu was probably on his side. Other than her--]
 14:  258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  259| [45] [(It doesn't look like any words are getting through to Jun.)]
 16:  309| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  310| [45] [(And Mr. Ukita appears to be the same way.)]
 18:  360| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  361| [45] [(And the latest one to turn violent is Ms. Tachibana, huh...)]
 20:  366| [45] [Those three were completely deranged. Trying to talk things out with them would likely be a fruitless endeavor.]
 21:  416| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  417| [45] [(... But Prof. Tsubakiyama seemed quite composed in comparison.)]
 23:  422| [45] [However, there were too many mysteries surrounding Ena.]
 24:  472| [45] [Why did she have a gun? Why was she in LABO? Natsuhiko had no idea.]
 25:  522| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  523| [45] [(Then there's that girl who called herself Yuuri... What about her?)]
 27:  528| [45] [He knew next to nothing about this "Yuuri".]
 28:  533| [45] [The girl mysteriously appeared and mysteriously disappeared.]
 29:  538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  539| [45] [(Who in the world is she...?)]
 31:  596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  597| [45] [(... No, don't tell me she's... the "monster"...!?)]
 33:  647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  648| [45] [(I-Is that even possible...!?)]
 35:  653| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind,]
 36:  658| [45] [he suddenly heard something in his head--]
 37:  727| [85] [{--Hikorin}]
 38:  728| [86] [???]
 39:  729| [86] [{--Hikorin}]
 40:  757| [45] [--A familiar voice.]
 41:  772| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  775| [45] ["!?"]
 43:  841| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped as the echoing voice continued inside his brain.]
 44:  898| [85] [{Hikorin, save me...!}]
 45:  899| [86] [???]
 46:  900| [86] [{Hikorin, save me...!}]
 47:  928| [45] [There was no mistaking it. That was BC. And it sounded like Yuuri's voice.]
 48:  936| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  939| [45] [{Y-Yuuri!?}]
 50:  996| [85] [{Huh... Hikorin!?}]
 51:  997| [86] [Yuuri]
 52:  998| [86] [{Huh... Hikorin!?}]
 53: 1026| [45] [An attempt at telepathy on Natsuhiko's part garnered a response from Yuuri.]
 54: 1034| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1037| [45] [{Are-- are you Yuuri!? You are, aren't you!?}]
 56: 1066| [47] [Yuuri]
 57: 1069| [45] [{Y... yeah.}]
 58: 1093| [47] [Yuuri]
 59: 1096| [45] [{I know you might find it hard to believe, though...}]
 60: 1104| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1107| [45] [{Then is this voice your telepathy!?}]
 62: 1131| [47] [Yuuri]
 63: 1134| [45] [{Yeah... You see, I'm a Communicator.}]
 64: 1139| [45] [After a short, silent pause, she continued.]
 65: 1163| [47] [Yuuri]
 66: 1166| [45] [{... I know it doesn't make any sense coming from me when I'm supposed to have died nine years ago...}]
 67: 1190| [47] [Yuuri]
 68: 1193| [45] [{... but please... believe in me, Hikorin.}]
 69: 1198| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1201| [45] [{You see, I'm actually still alive...}]
 71: 1206| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1209| [45] [{And I knew you were here in this facility.}]
 73: 1233| [47] [Yuuri]
 74: 1236| [45] [{This whole time, I've been thinking... if only I could see you...!}]
 75: 1241| [45] [The tone of her voice perfectly matched that of the one Yuuri used in his memories.]
 76: 1246| [45] [No, it was more than just that.]
 77: 1251| [45] [The emotions conveyed with her telepathy and the contents of her words--%Nboth seemed to indicate that Yuuri was indeed the owner of that voice.]
 78: 1256| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1257| [45] [(Yuuri...!)]
 80: 1262| [45] [Various emotions ebbed and flowed within Natsuhiko's mind.]
 81: 1267| [45] [He was convinced that she was no monster.]
 82: 1272| [45] [There were countless things he wanted to tell her. Countless things he wanted to ask her.%NBut Natsuhiko stayed his heart and responded.]
 83: 1280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1283| [45] [{Of course, Yuuri...}]
 85: 1291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1294| [45] [{Of course I believe you. I believe anything you say.}]
 87: 1302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1305| [45] [{I've wanted to see you all this time, too.}]
 89: 1364| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1367| [45] [{...!}]
 91: 1391| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1394| [45] [{Th... thank you, Hikorin.}]
 93: 1399| [45] [Her telepathy conveyed to Natsuhiko how touched she felt.]
 94: 1404| [45] [So he continued as a means to give her some peace of mind.]
 95: 1412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1415| [45] [{By the way, Yuuri, are you safe?}]
 97: 1439| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1442| [45] [{Y-yeah! I'm not hurt in particular or anything.}]
 99: 1450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1453| [45] [{Thank goodness. So where are you now?}]
101: 1477| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1480| [45] [{Um... I'm in a place called the "shelter".}]
103: 1488| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1491| [45] [{Shelter?}]
105: 1515| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1518| [45] [{There's a secret room in Area 5.}]
107: 1526| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1529| [45] [{A-a secret room!?}]
109: 1534| [45] [He was surprised for a second, but now that he thought about it, he -was- in an peculiar facility.]
110: 1539| [45] [Perhaps it wasn't such an oddity for it to have a secret room or two.]
111: 1547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1550| [45] [{Yuuri, please give me the details. Where exactly is that room?}]
113: 1555| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1558| [45] [{Area 5's outer ring, B1. There should be a numeric keypad on the wall close to the emergency staircase...}]
115: 1563| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1566| [45] [{If you press in 107215, the wall should open, revealing a door.}]
117: 1574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1577| [45] [{So that's it...!}]
119: 1582| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, he did see something like that when he had been inside Watase's mind.]
120: 1635| [47] [Watase]
121: 1638| [45] ["Hey, hold on a sec, guys."]
122: 1792| [47] [Kazami]
123: 1795| [45] ["Huh?"]
124: 1803| [47] [Watase]
125: 1806| [45] ["What do you think this is?"]
126: 1811| [45] [Attached to the wall was a small panel that read "EMERGENCY".]
127: 1816| [45] [Right below it was a keypad of sorts with ten buttons labeled from 0 to 9.]
128: 1922| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1925| [45] [{... Okay. Got it, Yuuri. 107215, right? Are you alone there?}]
130: 1949| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 1952| [45] [{Yeah, but...}]
132: 1976| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 1979| [45] [{When I tried using empathy on everybody, I heard such horrid thoughts coming from them...%NI'm scared...!}]
134: 1987| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 1990| [45] [{Okay, Yuuri. I'll be right there, so wait for me!}]
136: 2042| [45] [After telling her that, Natsuhiko got up.]
137: 2050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 2053| [45] ["Khh..."]
139: 2079| [47] [Watase]
140: 2082| [45] ["Hmm? What's wrong?"]
141: 2090| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2093| [45] ["I've gotta go..."]
143: 2098| [45] [Natsuhiko withstood the pain in his entire body and started to rise to his feet.]
144: 2152| [47] [Watase]
145: 2155| [45] ["H-hey, hold up!"]
146: 2181| [47] [Watase]
147: 2184| [45] ["Where do you think you're going!? You're severely wounded, you know?"]
148: 2210| [47] [Watase]
149: 2213| [45] ["The transfusion's not even done yet. And Tachibana and the others could be lurking out there. It's too dangerous to leave this room."]
150: 2218| [45] [Watase was right. Natsuhiko was indeed severly wounded.]
151: 2223| [45] [He could very well use up the rest of his strength trying to look for Yuuri.]
152: 2228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2229| [45] [(Guess that leaves me with no choice...!)]
154: 2253| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko looked Watase squarely in the eye.]
155: 2261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2264| [45] ["... In that case, Captain Kasasagi..."]
157: 2272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2275| [45] ["Can you bring me to where Yuuri is?"]
159: 2301| [47] [Watase]
160: 2304| [45] ["Hmm? You know her?"]
161: 2312| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 2315| [45] ["Yeah... she's a precious friend of mine."]
163: 2341| [47] [Watase]
164: 2344| [45] ["I see. I'd love to bring you to her, but I don't know where she--"]
165: 2352| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2355| [45] ["There's a secret shelter in Area 5's outer ring on B1. If you can't find her, that might be where she is..."]
167: 2381| [47] [Watase]
168: 2384| [45] ["A shelter!? How would you know about something like that!?"]
169: 2392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2395| [45] ["Well-- only LABO staff members know about it."]
171: 2403| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2406| [45] ["Did you happen to find a place in the Area 5 hallway that had a numeric keypad?"]
173: 2432| [47] [Watase]
174: 2435| [45] ["Y-yeah, now that you mention it..."]
175: 2443| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2446| [45] ["That was the shelter entrance."]
177: 2454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2457| [45] ["Yuuri and I are both children of LABO staff members, you see... so we heard about it from our parents."]
179: 2462| [45] [Yuuri had told Watase that she was a relative of a LABO staff member.]
180: 2467| [45] [So Natsuhiko thought that Watase would buy that half-truth, but--]
181: 2493| [47] [Watase]
182: 2496| [45] ["Wait a sec... I'm confused about a few things here."]
183: 2504| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2507| [45] ["Huh?"]
185: 2533| [47] [Watase]
186: 2536| [45] ["How'd you even know Yuuri was here in LABO in the first place?"]
187: 2544| [47] [Watase]
188: 2547| [45] ["Yuuri disappeared before I found you out cold, you know? Did you guys meet up somewhere before you passed out in Area N?"]
189: 2555| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2558| [45] ["That's the one thing I can't tell you for now... but please, believe me..."]
191: 2584| [47] [Watase]
192: 2587| [45] ["... But still..."]
193: 2595| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2598| [45] ["I understand why you'd doubt me. But there's one thing I can say for sure--"]
195: 2606| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2609| [45] ["You and I share the same desire to save Yuuri."]
197: 2632| [47] [Watase]
198: 2633| [45] ["..."]
199: 2641| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2644| [45] ["... So please..."]
201: 2649| [45] [Natsuhiko bowed his head down and pleaded to Watase.]
202: 2654| [45] [Watase hesitated for a while-- but he eventually nodded meekly.]
203: 2680| [47] [Watase]
204: 2683| [45] ["... Okay. I'll believe in you."]
205: 2773| [45] [With that affirmation, Watase carried Natsuhiko on his back.]
206: 2778| [45] [And as he held the blood transfusion kit underneath his arm, they left the room.]
207: 2853| [47] [Watase]
208: 2856| [45] ["This shelter or whatever is in kind of a hard place to get to. The staircases are collapsed all over the place, you see."]
209: 2864| [47] [Watase]
210: 2867| [45] ["So we'll take a detour through Area 1. Kind of a roundabout way, but you okay with that?"]
211: 2875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 2878| [45] ["Yeah. I'm counting on you."]
213: 2886| [47] [Watase]
214: 2889| [45] ["All right. Hang on tight."]
215: 2900| [45] [Watase walked on with Natsuhiko on his back.]
216: 2905| [45] [And as Watase carried him, Natsuhiko sent telepathy to Yuuri.]
217: 2974| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2977| [45] [{Yuuri, can you hear me?}]
219: 2982| [45] [An answer soon came back.]
220: 3011| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 3014| [45] [{I hear you, Hikorin.}]
222: 3022| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 3025| [45] [{Watase and I are heading your way.}]
224: 3049| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 3052| [45] [{Huh...!? C-Captain Kasasagi's with you too!?}]
226: 3060| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 3063| [45] [{Don't worry. Watase's our ally now.}]
228: 3087| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 3090| [45] [{Our ally...?}]
230: 3095| [45] [Natsuhiko could feel Yuuri's surprise and bewilderment.]
231: 3100| [45] [So she really was being extremely cautious about Watase, then.]
232: 3108| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3111| [45] [{... I don't really understand what kind of person Watase is either.}]
234: 3119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3122| [45] [{I think he probably was a human filled with malice originally.}]
236: 3146| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 3149| [45] [{Y-yeah.}]
238: 3157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 3160| [45] [{But now that Watase's lost his memory, he's become a harmless being.}]
240: 3184| [47] [Yuuri]
241: 3187| [45] [{... That's true. He's saved me several times too, after all...}]
242: 3211| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 3214| [45] [{But why did he lose his memory? Do you have any idea, Hikorin?}]
244: 3222| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 3225| [45] [{You might not believe this--}]
246: 3233| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 3236| [45] [{But it's because I erased his memory.}]
248: 3295| [47] [Yuuri]
249: 3298| [45] [{!!}]
250: 3306| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 3309| [45] [{And after that, I've even been sharing his senses. Seeing his actions through his eyes.}]
252: 3317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 3320| [45] [{I guess I've got that sort of ability now, apparently.}]
254: 3325| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 3328| [45] [{Hikorin, you mean--}]
256: 3352| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 3355| [45] [{You've completely mastered the "third ability"!?}]
258: 3363| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3366| [45] [{W-wait, what!?}]
260: 3371| [45] [Hearing that phrase took Natsuhiko by surprise.]
261: 3379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
262: 3382| [45] [{You know about the existence of the third ability too!?}]
263: 3406| [47] [Yuuri]
264: 3409| [45] [{Yeah... That explains a lot, then.}]
265: 3433| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 3436| [45] [{I didn't even consider that possibility... but I guess I should've expected you could do it.}]
267: 3441| [45] [Yuuri spoke as if she were talking to herself.]
268: 3446| [45] [She seemed to know a lot more than Natsuhiko did.]
269: 3454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 3457| [45] [{... Let's save the details for when we can talk face-to-face. We're almost there.}]
271: 3481| [47] [Yuuri]
272: 3484| [45] [{Okay. I'll be waiting...}]
273: 3505| [45] [And thus, their communication ended--]
274: 3564| [45] [--and Natsuhiko entrusted himself to Watase's back.]
