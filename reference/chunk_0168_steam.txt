  1:   81| [47] [Ena]
  2:   84| [45] ["I know I've said before that BC is direct brain-to-brain communication, but..."]
  3:  110| [47] [Ena]
  4:  113| [45] ["Let's take a look at what exactly happens from a physical standpoint to achieve that."]
  5:  118| [45] [Ena worked on her computer as she spoke.]
  6:  123| [45] [Which caused the screen to display a figure of a person's head.]
  7:  212| [47] [Ena]
  8:  215| [45] ["First of all, these 'BC particles' I've mentioned fill our surroundings and have the capability to move through all matter."]
  9:  223| [47] [Ena]
 10:  226| [45] ["Which of course includes your skulls and your brains within..."]
 11:  234| [47] [Ena]
 12:  237| [45] ["Also, brain activity itself is 'thought information' which is generated by the brain's electrical signals."]
 13:  245| [47] [Ena]
 14:  248| [45] ["This 'thought information' is transmittable to the outside."]
 15:  305| [47] [Ena]
 16:  308| [45] ["In a similar fashion to how your voice uses the air as an intermediary in normal conversation, your thoughts use these elementary particles as an intermediary."]
 17:  316| [47] [Ena]
 18:  319| [45] ["Though obviously, the information energy created from thoughts is extremely minuscule."]
 19:  327| [47] [Ena]
 20:  330| [45] ["When BC particles leave the brain, their energy diffuses in the blink of an eye, causing the thought information to disappear as well."]
 21:  338| [47] [Ena]
 22:  341| [45] ["Normally it'd be impossible to use this method to convey your thoughts to others, but..."]
 23:  349| [47] [Ena]
 24:  352| [45] ["It is possible for certain individuals, namely you 'Communicators'."]
 25:  360| [47] [Ena]
 26:  363| [45] ["You use this part of the brain here."]
 27:  421| [47] [Ena]
 28:  424| [45] ["This part of the human brain, the prefrontal cortex, has an organ called the 'BC receptor'."]
 29:  432| [47] [Ena]
 30:  435| [45] ["The function of this organ was once unknown, but--"]
 31:  443| [47] [Ena]
 32:  446| [45] ["In recent years, its use in the transmission and reception of BC has been clarified."]
 33:  454| [47] [Ena]
 34:  457| [45] ["Your BC receptor's structure and capacity for growth is determined at birth by genetics.%NThat is what determines your 'aptitude'..."]
 35:  465| [47] [Ena]
 36:  468| [45] ["And the extent to which you can consciously use it is what determines your 'ability level'."]
 37:  473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  474| [45] [(I see. So in other words, the BC receptor in my brain is apparently quite different from that of an ordinary person.)]
 39:  479| [45] [That said, he could not understand at all how that would actually allow them to use BC.]
 40:  484| [45] [But just as if she had seen through him, Ena continued.]
 41:  542| [47] [Ena]
 42:  545| [45] ["Now then, allow me to explain step-by-step the process that occurs with telepathy."]
 43:  602| [47] [Ena]
 44:  605| [45] ["First, the telepathy user perceives the 'characteristic brain waveform' of the target the user wants to send their voice to."]
 45:  613| [47] [Ena]
 46:  616| [45] ["The characteristic brain waveform is the pattern of the electric current that constantly flows through your BC receptor. It varies from person to person."]
 47:  624| [47] [Ena]
 48:  627| [45] ["That pattern is also mediated by BC particles and is faintly transmitted to your surroundings. Even if you're not a Communicator."]
 49:  635| [47] [Ena]
 50:  638| [45] ["Everyone with a functioning brain leaks out a minute amount of information energy."]
 51:  646| [47] [Ena]
 52:  649| [45] ["It's a truly minute amount of energy that most people can't perceive, but Communicators can."]
 53:  657| [47] [Ena]
 54:  660| [45] ["By perceiving a target's pattern, you can use it to give your telepathy directionality.%NBasically, you can selectively specify who receives it."]
 55:  668| [47] [Ena]
 56:  671| [45] ["In terms of a phone call, it's akin to knowing someone's phone number."]
 57:  728| [47] [Ena]
 58:  731| [45] ["So, after you've perceived the target's characteristic brain waveform, you concentrate strongly on it."]
 59:  739| [47] [Ena]
 60:  742| [45] ["Doing so causes your characteristic brain waveform and that of the target to interact with atmospheric BC particles--"]
 61:  750| [47] [Ena]
 62:  753| [45] ["Thereby establishing a remote brain-brain connection mediated by the BC particles."]
 63:  761| [47] [Ena]
 64:  764| [45] ["In terms of a phone call, it's perhaps the same as connecting to the other person's line."]
 65:  821| [47] [Ena]
 66:  824| [45] ["Then you concentrate very, very, very hard on the message you want to send to your target--"]
 67:  832| [47] [Ena]
 68:  835| [45] ["And the BC receptor inside the Communicator's brain begins to work hard."]
 69:  843| [47] [Ena]
 70:  846| [45] ["Which amplifies the normally minute information energy in the brain anywhere from several thousand to several hundred million times."]
 71:  854| [47] [Ena]
 72:  857| [45] ["The amplified energy is sent in the form of BC particles to the BC receptor in the target's brain..."]
 73:  865| [47] [Ena]
 74:  868| [45] ["Which causes the auditory complex to secrete neurotransmitters that makes it sound like a voice is inside their head."]
 75:  876| [47] [Ena]
 76:  879| [45] ["In terms of a phone call, it would be actually talking to the person on the phone."]
 77:  887| [47] [Ena]
 78:  890| [45] ["Those are the three steps to the process of expressing telepathy."]
 79:  949| [45] [Just about everybody who had dealt with BC had heard at least a little about that process.]
 80:  954| [45] [But Salyu kept nodding as she listened intently.]
 81:  980| [47] [Salyu]
 82:  983| [45] ["So you're saying that Communicators can generate information energy inside their brains?"]
 83: 1009| [47] [Salyu]
 84: 1012| [45] ["That sounds like you're creating something out of nothing."]
 85: 1107| [47] [Ena]
 86: 1110| [45] ["That's not exactly the case. Actually, when a Communicator uses BC, it consumes calories just like exercise does."]
 87: 1136| [47] [Ena]
 88: 1139| [45] ["Essentially, to create information energy, you need to convert it from the body's heat energy."]
 89: 1234| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1237| [45] ["Huh!? So you mean you can diet by using telepathy all day!?"]
 91: 1332| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1335| [45] ["Many people are under that impression... but before you can actually affect your weight, your brain usually tires out and loses concentration, rendering you incapable of continuing telepathy."]
 93: 1430| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1433| [45] ["Tch, too bad...!"]
 95: 1528| [47] [Ena]
 96: 1531| [45] ["Well, in any case, since Communicators can process information energy through concentration, they are in a sense similar to Maxwell's demon."]
 97: 1557| [47] [Ena]
 98: 1560| [45] ["But in the end, you cannot create something out of nothing. Not even demons can break universal laws."]
 99: 1655| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1658| [45] ["I understand now. So Communicators are still just a category of normal human beings."]
101: 1663| [45] [Even Salyu nodded in agreement with Ena's words.]
102: 1758| [47] [Ena]
103: 1761| [45] ["There are quite a few Communicators who can use telepathy despite not knowing a thing about its underlying mechanisms or theories."]
104: 1787| [47] [Ena]
105: 1790| [45] ["In the same way that you don't need to understand the physiology of the lungs and diaphragm to breathe."]
106: 1879| [47] [Ena]
107: 1882| [45] ["... But the part those Communicators easily fail at is the process that precedes the actual telepathy."]
108: 1890| [47] [Ena]
109: 1893| [45] ["That is, perceiving the target's characteristic brain waveform and giving their telepathy directionality."]
110: 1901| [47] [Ena]
111: 1904| [45] ["Unless you get this step correct, your telepathy will leak everywhere."]
112: 1912| [47] [Ena]
113: 1915| [45] ["Everyone in the vicinity will hear your message."]
114: 1923| [47] [Ena]
115: 1926| [45] ["Now, I know I'm saying this as someone who can't use BC, but leaky telepathy is annoying,%Nso I don't like it."]
116: 1934| [47] [Ena]
117: 1937| [45] ["What I do like is smart use of telepathy. If others hear your confessions of love or other such private talk, it ruins the purpose of telepathy."]
118: 2011| [45] [Ena's remark reminded Natsuhiko of business as usual at school.]
119: 2016| [45] [How telepathy would fly about at random and how Ena would have to use the intercom to warn against it.]
120: 2021| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2022| [45] [(True, it really is annoying...)]
122: 2027| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Ena fiddled with the computer once more.]
123: 2054| [47] [Ena]
124: 2057| [45] ["... And with that, let's now introduce the 'Enneagram'!"]
125: 2136| [45] [And with that, a diagram of a irregular nine-pointed star appeared on the screen.]
126: 2141| [45] [It was a figure often seen in BC practice.]
127: 2211| [47] [Ena]
128: 2214| [45] ["Now, you might be asking 'the Enneagram again?', but the basics are always important."]
129: 2240| [47] [Ena]
130: 2243| [45] ["Today, let's try practicing with this in mind."]
131: 2248| [45] [Salyu looked at the figure quizzically and muttered.]
132: 2343| [47] [Salyu]
133: 2346| [45] ["... Enneagram?"]
134: 2441| [47] [Ena]
135: 2444| [45] ["Hmm? Is this figure not widespread in the French method of BC training programs?"]
136: 2539| [47] [Salyu]
137: 2542| [45] ["--Yeah."]
138: 2637| [47] [Ena]
139: 2640| [45] ["I see. Well, let me use this opportunity to explain it once again."]
140: 2666| [47] [Ena]
141: 2669| [45] ["Everyone else listen closely too, to make sure you know it front and back."]
142: 2674| [45] [Ena then began to explain the figure.]
143: 2682| [47] [Ena]
144: 2685| [45] ["This figure was originally created for another purpose, but we now use it in BC training to classify the nine types of characteristic brain waveforms."]
145: 2711| [47] [Ena]
146: 2714| [45] ["Even though the characteristic brain waveform varies from person to person, they don't deviate too far from these nine types. It's mostly minor individual variations."]
147: 2722| [47] [Ena]
148: 2725| [45] ["You should fall into one of these nine types as well, Ms. Sannomiya."]
149: 2820| [47] [Salyu]
150: 2823| [45] ["I understand now."]
151: 2828| [45] [Salyu nodded deeply at Ena's explanation.]
152: 2854| [47] [Salyu]
153: 2857| [45] ["So basically you can use this as a model to help perceive your target's brain waveform.%NFrom there, you can adjust for individual variation, right?"]
154: 2952| [47] [Ena]
155: 2955| [45] ["Very perceptive of you, Ms. Sannomiya. The Enneagram is indeed a BC beginner's guide to perceiving brain waveforms."]
156: 2981| [47] [Ena]
157: 2984| [45] ["Incidentally, a person's characteristic brain waveform is said to reflect that person's personality."]
158: 3010| [47] [Ena]
159: 3013| [45] ["Perceiving someone's waveform could help you understand them and serve as the first step to forming an emotional bond... Though, it might be a little forced to say that much."]
160: 3018| [45] [Ena smiled wryly before addressing the students.]
161: 3044| [47] [Ena]
162: 3047| [45] ["Anyway, class? Let's practice telepathy with a particular focus on directionality today."]
163: 3073| [47] [Ena]
164: 3076| [45] ["So, as always, split up into groups of two, okay?"]
165: 3129| [45] [And with that, the students turned to their neighbors and began practicing.]
166: 3140| [45] [Natsuhiko was about to partner up with Mashiro, but--]
167: 3148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 3151| [45] ["Oh wait, that means Salyu's missing a partner."]
169: 3177| [47] [Salyu]
170: 3180| [45] ["Can't practice alone... so I'll go sleep."]
171: 3206| [47] [Mashiro]
172: 3209| [45] ["Hey, you can't do that, Salyu."]
173: 3214| [45] [Mashiro turned her head and spoke to Ena.]
174: 3271| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 3274| [45] ["Ms. Ena, can we form a group of three to include Ms. Sannomiya?"]
176: 3300| [47] [Ena]
177: 3303| [45] ["Of course."]
178: 3329| [47] [Ena]
179: 3332| [45] ["Ah, that's right. I believe you've already mastered telepathy, Ms. Toba, so could you lead Mr. Tenkawa and Ms. Sannomiya for me?"]
180: 3358| [47] [Mashiro]
181: 3361| [45] ["Yes, ma'am, leave it to me!"]
182: 3387| [47] [Ena]
183: 3390| [45] ["Good. Please, begin then."]
184: 3441| [45] [And with that, Ena started to look around the classroom.]
185: 3446| [45] [Mashiro smirked and turned to Natsuhiko and Salyu.]
186: 3521| [47] [Mashiro]
187: 3524| [45] ["Okay then, let's get things started, guys!"]
188: 3532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 3535| [45] ["You sure seem enthusiastic... Look, I know she said to lead us, but you don't really need to do anything special, right?"]
190: 3561| [47] [Mashiro]
191: 3564| [45] ["What's that, Natsuhiko? Talking back to your senior drill instructor, are we?"]
192: 3572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 3575| [45] ["S-senior drill instructor?"]
194: 3580| [45] [As Natsuhiko spoke in confusion, Mashiro puffed up her chest in pride.]
195: 3705| [47] [Mashiro]
196: 3708| [45] ["I am Gunnery Sergeant Mashiro Toba, your senior BC drill instructor!"]
197: 3716| [47] [Mashiro]
198: 3719| [45] ["From now on, the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be 'Sir'.%NDo you babies understand that?"]
199: 3724| [45] [Those were lines from a famous war movie. Though she did try to tone down the language.]
200: 3732| [47] [Salyu]
201: 3735| [45] ["... Mashiro got scary all of a sudden. Why's that?"]
202: 3743| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 3746| [45] ["Just play along and say 'Sir, yes Sir'. That's the only way to please her when she gets like this."]
204: 3754| [47] [Salyu]
205: 3757| [45] ["Okay. Sir, yes Sir."]
206: 3765| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 3768| [45] ["Good, then let's commence training on the double!"]
208: 3773| [45] [Mashiro faced Natsuhiko and Salyu as she spoke.]
209: 3844| [47] [Mashiro]
210: 3847| [45] ["First, perceive each other's brain waveforms!"]
211: 3855| [47] [Mashiro]
212: 3858| [45] ["Even baby Communicators can do it if they try! Now move it!"]
213: 3866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3869| [45] ["Sir, yes Sir."]
215: 3874| [45] [Natsuhiko played along for the time being as he focused on Salyu in front of him.]
216: 3879| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 3880| [45] [(This is the only part I'm good at...)]
218: 3951| [45] [He shut his eyes and sharpened his senses.]
219: 3962| [45] [And eventually--]
220: 4058| [45] [Salyu's characteristic brain waveform flickered in the back of Natsuhiko's mind.]
221: 4063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 4064| [45] [(I saw it! It's Type 4!)]
223: 4069| [45] [It was the waveform of artists and eccentrics.]
224: 4074| [45] [Hers was quite varied from the archetypal characteristic, but he somehow managed to perceive it correctly.]
225: 4149| [45] [Natsuhiko opened his eyes and spoke to Salyu.]
226: 4157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 4160| [45] ["I perceived it. You're a Type 4, Salyu."]
228: 4165| [45] [Salyu opened her eyes wide as Natsuhiko pointed at the Enneagram.]
229: 4191| [47] [Salyu]
230: 4194| [45] ["Is that so? Never knew that."]
231: 4202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 4205| [45] ["What about you, Salyu? Did you perceive my waveform?"]
233: 4231| [47] [Salyu]
234: 4234| [45] ["... Umm, probably. I think it's that one."]
235: 4239| [45] [Salyu pointed to the upper part of the Enneagram.]
236: 4247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 4250| [45] ["Wow Salyu, you really are a quick learner. That's right, I'm a Type 7."]
238: 4255| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't quite understand why it was his classification, but it was said to be the brain waveform of enthusiastic people.]
239: 4260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 4261| [45] [(Well, I guess predicting personality with brainwaves is kind of like predicting it with blood types. That is, it's not that accurate at all...)]
241: 4266| [45] [As Natsuhiko pondered, Mashiro spoke with satisfaction.]
242: 4344| [47] [Mashiro]
243: 4347| [45] ["Today, you people are no longer babies! Today, you are Communicators. You're part of a brotherhood."]
244: 4355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 4358| [45] ["Huh, boot camp over already?"]
246: 4384| [47] [Mashiro]
247: 4387| [45] ["Nah, well, it's tiring to keep talking like that, so I just wanted to go back to normal."]
248: 4413| [47] [Salyu]
249: 4416| [45] ["That helps a lot."]
250: 4442| [47] [Mashiro]
251: 4445| [45] ["Now, now, that hurts."]
252: 4450| [45] [Mashiro laughed out loud before continuing.]
253: 4476| [47] [Mashiro]
254: 4479| [45] ["Now then, why don't we try actually communicating through telepathy?"]
255: 4487| [47] [Mashiro]
256: 4490| [45] ["The trick to telepathy is to concentrate hard with all your mind."]
257: 4516| [47] [Mashiro]
258: 4519| [45] ["So it might be easier to go with something you feel from the bottom of your heart rather than something you don't really mean."]
259: 4527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
260: 4530| [45] ["I see. So something I feel from the bottom of my heart, huh..."]
261: 4535| [45] [As Natsuhiko pondered that trick, Salyu tugged on his sleeve.]
262: 4561| [47] [Salyu]
263: 4564| [45] ["Natsuhiko, try it."]
264: 4572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 4575| [45] ["Okay, then, let's get to it--"]
266: 4580| [45] [Natsuhiko concentrated to the best of his ability.]
267: 4585| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 4586| [45] [(... I'm starving. Maybe the rice gruel was too good with helping digestion.)]
269: 4591| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 4592| [45] [(I hope class ends soon so we can have lunch already...!)]
271: 4597| [45] [He intended to send the message that he truly felt from the bottom of his heart.]
272: 4602| [45] [But no matter how desperately he concentrated, Salyu said nothing and her expression didn't change at all.]
273: 4610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
274: 4613| [45] ["... So, did you get my telepathy?"]
275: 4639| [47] [Salyu]
276: 4642| [45] ["Not at all."]
277: 4650| [47] [Natsuhiko]
278: 4653| [45] ["I see. I knew it..."]
279: 4658| [45] [He really was bad at BC.]
280: 4663| [45] [The telepathy he used three days ago was looking more and more like some sort of fluke.]
281: 4689| [47] [Mashiro]
282: 4692| [45] ["Stay patient and take turns practicing. Salyu, you're up next."]
283: 4780| [47] [Salyu]
284: 4783| [45] ["Roger."]
285: 4806| [45] [Salyu put her hand up to her temple.]
286: 4811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 4812| [45] [(Mmgh, she looks serious...)]
288: 4817| [45] [That was their first time seeing Salyu using BC.]
289: 4822| [45] [Natsuhiko watched in bated breath to see the extent of her ability--]
290: 4848| [47] [Salyu]
291: 4851| [45] ["... I'm hungry."]
292: 4856| [45] [That's the voice he heard.]
293: 4861| [45] [But it wasn't information firing off in his brain, but her natural voice passing through her lips.]
294: 4866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
295: 4867| [45] ["..."]
296: 4970| [47] [Mashiro]
297: 4973| [45] ["... Umm, Salyu? You spoke out loud, you know?"]
298: 4999| [47] [Salyu]
299: 5002| [45] ["Yes."]
300: 5007| [45] [Salyu calmly answered Mashiro's question.]
301: 5061| [47] [Natsuhiko]
302: 5064| [45] ["Wait, Salyu, are you perhaps bad at BC too?"]
303: 5090| [47] [Salyu]
304: 5093| [45] ["Bad? ... Yes, essentially."]
305: 5101| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 5104| [45] ["I see..."]
307: 5109| [45] [The school naturally attracted students who wanted to become great Communicators.]
308: 5114| [45] [People who were fully aware of how bad they were at BC like Natsuhiko and Salyu were a tiny minority.]
309: 5127| [45] [That alone was enough to make him feel genuine camaraderie.]
310: 5135| [47] [Natsuhiko]
311: 5138| [45] ["I guess everyone really does have a weak spot after all, huh..."]
312: 5164| [47] [Salyu]
313: 5167| [45] ["Shut up."]
314: 5175| [47] [Natsuhiko]
315: 5178| [45] ["Ah, no, no, I wasn't making fun of you or anything."]
316: 5186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
317: 5189| [45] ["I guess I'm a little relieved, actually..."]
318: 5215| [47] [Salyu]
319: 5218| [45] ["...?"]
320: 5223| [45] [Salyu looked on dubiously as Natsuhiko tried to gloss things over.%NAnd that's when Ena spoke up to them.]
321: 5234| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 5237| [45] ["... Looks like you're gonna have a tough time from now on."]
323: 5263| [47] [Salyu]
324: 5266| [45] ["Your concern is unnecessary. And I don't want to hear it from you."]
325: 5292| [47] [Salyu]
326: 5295| [45] ["Your ability level's 0 too after all."]
327: 5303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
328: 5306| [45] ["Well, yeah, that's true, but..."]
329: 5311| [45] [Natsuhiko looked somewhat daunted.]
330: 5316| [47] [Natsuhiko]
331: 5317| [45] [(Well, Salyu's right. My real motivation is to not make other people worry, but...)]
332: 5322| [45] [That's when Ena spoke out to them.]
333: 5408| [47] [Ena]
334: 5411| [45] ["Oh my? Ms. Sannomiya, are you not good with BC?"]
335: 5472| [47] [Mashiro]
336: 5475| [45] ["That appears to be the case."]
337: 5536| [47] [Ena]
338: 5539| [45] ["I see... but I heard Ms. Sannomiya had Rank D Aptitude."]
339: 5544| [45] [Aptitude was, in a sense, a Communicator's talent or latent ability.]
340: 5549| [45] [Rank D Aptitude was fifth from the top. It was the lowest aptitude among students at this school, but--]
341: 5575| [47] [Ena]
342: 5578| [45] ["You should be able to master telepathy depending on how hard you train... so how about it?"]
343: 5639| [47] [Salyu]
344: 5642| [45] ["... Actually, I have trouble using telepathy. Not only am I bad at BC, but it's also dependent on my physical condition."]
345: 5650| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 5653| [45] ["Hmm, you not feeling good today?"]
347: 5662| [47] [Salyu]
348: 5665| [45] ["Yes. When I can't use it, I can't use it at all. Especially during menstruation and such."]
349: 5741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 5744| [45] ["Huh!?"]
351: 5749| [45] [Natsuhiko and the others were taken aback by her abrupt use of that word.]
352: 5781| [47] [Ena]
353: 5784| [45] ["I-I see... well, try not to push yourself, okay?"]
354: 5853| [45] [Ena forced a stiff smile and let them be.]
355: 5905| [47] [Mashiro]
356: 5908| [45] ["... You know, Salyu. I don't think it's good for you to say stuff like that in the presence of boys."]
357: 5958| [47] [Salyu]
358: 5961| [45] ["Really? Okay, I'll be careful."]
359: 5969| [47] [Natsuhiko]
360: 5972| [45] ["Yeah, that'd be for the best..."]
361: 5978| [45] [Natsuhiko once again began to think that she really was an odd girl.]
362: 6010| [47] [Mashiro]
363: 6013| [45] ["So I guess you two are around the same level, huh?"]
364: 6039| [47] [Mashiro]
365: 6042| [45] ["In that case, let Gunnery Sergeant Mashiro here show you a textbook example."]
366: 6050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
367: 6053| [45] ["Sure, that sounds like it'd be good for Salyu."]
368: 6079| [47] [Salyu]
369: 6082| [45] ["Mm, please do."]
370: 6108| [47] [Mashiro]
371: 6111| [45] ["Okay, then I'll do some practice myself-- and show you guys a bunch of different types of telepathy."]
372: 6116| [45] [Mashiro took out her parapsychology textbook as she spoke.]
373: 6121| [45] [There were several BC skill training methods written in there.]
374: 6126| [45] [For example, according to the text, the best shortcut to improving telepathy skill was to actually use that ability.]
375: 6152| [47] [Mashiro]
376: 6155| [45] ["So, starting with Telepathy Improvement Manual Part 15: Transmitting Abstract Thoughts."]
377: 6163| [47] [Mashiro]
378: 6166| [45] ["This is practice for sending thoughts that can't be expressed in words."]
379: 6192| [47] [Salyu]
380: 6195| [45] ["Thoughts that can't be expressed in words?"]
381: 6221| [47] [Mashiro]
382: 6224| [45] ["For example, you can send abstract messages that are hard to describe like happy feelings or sad emotions."]
383: 6250| [47] [Mashiro]
384: 6253| [45] ["So with that said, I'll try sending you guys some different emotions through telepathy. Close your eyes and concentrate on receiving them."]
385: 6279| [47] [Natsuhiko & Salyu]
386: 6282| [45] ["Okay."]
387: 6393| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu closed their eyes--]
388: 6398| [45] [and eventually, Mashiro's voice rang out in their heads.]
389: 6406| [47] [Mashiro]
390: 6409| [45] [{Okay, so first I'll start with a calm emotion.}]
391: 6417| [47] [Mashiro]
392: 6420| [45] [{First I'll send it to Natsuhiko, and then to Salyu.}]
393: 6481| [45] [--And then, a gentle feeling welled up from the bottom of their hearts.]
394: 6489| [47] [Natsuhiko]
395: 6492| [45] ["Mm... I feel kinda relaxed."]
396: 6500| [47] [Salyu]
397: 6503| [45] ["... I feel all snuggly."]
398: 6511| [47] [Mashiro]
399: 6514| [45] [{I know, right? By the way, this is generally how I always feel.}]
400: 6522| [47] [Mashiro]
401: 6525| [45] [{Next up is a sad emotion.}]
402: 6586| [45] [--The moment Mashiro said that, the pit of Natsuhiko's heart was torn out.]
403: 6594| [47] [Salyu]
404: 6597| [45] ["*sniff*..."]
405: 6605| [47] [Natsuhiko]
406: 6608| [45] ["Wh-what... what is this? I want to cry now."]
407: 6616| [47] [Mashiro]
408: 6619| [45] [{This is how I felt when I dropped my wallet the other day... It makes me want to cry just sending it to you.}]
409: 6627| [47] [Mashiro]
410: 6630| [45] [{Okay, time to pull ourselves back together. Next I'll send you what it feels like to fall in love.}]
411: 6692| [45] [--Right after he heard those words, Natsuhiko felt his heart clench.]
412: 6700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
413: 6703| [45] ["W-w-whoa...! It's so mushy and saccharine... yet so passionate...!"]
414: 6711| [47] [Salyu]
415: 6714| [45] ["M-Mashiro, is this how you yourself feel when you're in love...?"]
416: 6722| [47] [Mashiro]
417: 6725| [45] [{Non non. This is what I imagined as I read a romance manga the day before yesterday.}]
418: 6733| [47] [Natsuhiko]
419: 6736| [45] ["Wait, what the hell kind of manga did you read to get -this-...?"]
420: 6744| [47] [Salyu]
421: 6747| [45] ["It feels so adult, and, well, a little erotic, too..."]
422: 6755| [47] [Mashiro]
423: 6758| [45] [{That's a secret. Though it's true that its content might be a little too mature for Salyu, though.}]
424: 6763| [45] [And with that, Mashiro's telepathy performance came to a close.]
425: 6857| [47] [Mashiro]
426: 6860| [45] ["... And, welp, that's how it goes!"]
427: 6886| [47] [Mashiro]
428: 6889| [45] ["How was it, guys? What do you think of expert-level telepathy?"]
429: 6915| [47] [Salyu]
430: 6918| [45] ["Mm, it felt quite mysterious."]
431: 6944| [47] [Salyu]
432: 6947| [45] ["I never met such a skilled Communicator back home. That was a first. You're amazing, Mashiro."]
433: 6955| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 6958| [45] ["Yeah, you're getting better and better at telepathy, huh."]
435: 6984| [47] [Mashiro]
436: 6987| [45] ["Heheheh, it's all thanks to training."]
437: 7013| [47] [Mashiro]
438: 7016| [45] ["Well, just goes to show how if you train hard enough, you can gain access to communication that only Communicators can use."]
439: 7042| [47] [Salyu]
440: 7045| [45] ["Interesting. What else is possible?"]
441: 7071| [47] [Mashiro]
442: 7074| [45] ["Let's see... well, there's stuff like transmitting complex logical thought processes."]
443: 7100| [47] [Mashiro]
444: 7103| [45] ["Okay, so let me look at the text for a little bit... as I send you the value of pi."]
445: 7108| [45] [As Mashiro said this, a long string of numbers pounded Natsuhiko's brain.]
446: 7131| [47] [Mashiro]
447: 7134| [45] [{3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288--}]
448: 7142| [47] [Natsuhiko]
449: 7145| [45] ["Uwah, that feels kinda gross!"]
450: 7171| [47] [Salyu]
451: 7174| [45] ["But I'm pretty sure you can still convey this with normal words."]
452: 7200| [47] [Mashiro]
453: 7203| [45] ["Well, it's at least a convenience since it takes less time than explaining verbally."]
454: 7229| [47] [Mashiro]
455: 7232| [45] ["But it's most effective to do simple straightforward training like this."]
456: 7237| [45] [The truth was that outside of her training time with Natsuhiko, Mashiro would work hard at this sort of practice.]
457: 7242| [45] [And as a result, her telepathy precision increased and she became capable of many different types of telepathy applications.]
458: 7268| [47] [Mashiro]
459: 7271| [45] ["At any rate, it's an extremely interesting ability, so you two should get into it and try hard too!"]
460: 7297| [47] [Mashiro]
461: 7300| [45] ["First, let's start with point-blank range transmission to a familiar target."]
462: 7326| [47] [Natsuhiko & Salyu]
463: 7329| [45] ["Sir, yes Sir."]
464: 7425| [45] [At Mashiro's suggestion, the two of them began telepathy practice a little more seriously than usual.]
465: 7430| [45] [But in the end, before either Natsuhiko or Salyu could successfully send a single message--]
466: 7435| [45] [--the first hour of class came to an end.]
467: 7524| [47] [Salyu]
468: 7527| [45] ["... I tried my best, but it's still hard."]
469: 7535| [47] [Natsuhiko]
470: 7538| [45] ["Looks like we've still got a tough journey ahead of us, huh."]
471: 7588| [47] [Mashiro]
472: 7591| [45] ["Now, now, just take it nice and slow."]
473: 7596| [45] [As they were having that conversation, Ena addressed the students.]
474: 7717| [47] [Ena]
475: 7720| [45] ["Class, if you've got any questions about today's lecture, feel free to ask!"]
476: 7746| [47] [Ena]
477: 7749| [45] ["My vast stock of BC knowledge is always ready for open ears!"]
478: 7754| [47] [Natsuhiko]
479: 7755| [45] [(Vast stock of BC knowledge, huh? I usually ignore all that, but...)]
480: 7760| [45] [Feeling just a little bit more open to BC now, Natsuhiko decided to ask a small question for once.]
481: 7768| [47] [Natsuhiko]
482: 7771| [45] ["Umm, Professor?"]
483: 7797| [47] [Ena]
484: 7800| [45] ["Oh my, Mr. Tenkawa, how rare of you to ask a question~%NWhat is it?"]
485: 7808| [47] [Natsuhiko]
486: 7811| [45] ["I know you said that more and more BC discoveries have been made in recent years--"]
487: 7819| [47] [Natsuhiko]
488: 7822| [45] ["But telepathy and stuff existed even before the Grand BC Discovery, right?"]
489: 7830| [47] [Natsuhiko]
490: 7833| [45] ["So how was it all treated back in those days?"]
491: 7859| [47] [Ena]
492: 7862| [45] ["I see, that dates back to when I was a child."]
493: 7888| [47] [Ena]
494: 7891| [45] ["Hmm, let's see... well, first of all, nobody even considered the possibility that humans could directly conduct brain-brain exchange of 'information' through elementary particles."]
495: 7899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
496: 7902| [45] ["I can imagine. That was before we even knew about the true form of 'information', after all."]
497: 7928| [47] [Ena]
498: 7931| [45] ["But it's possible that everyone vaguely perceived the existence of BC itself, though."]
499: 7939| [47] [Ena]
500: 7942| [45] ["What had previously been labeled as a person's 'atmosphere' or 'aura' was likely their 'characteristic brain waveform' in actuality."]
501: 7950| [47] [Natsuhiko]
502: 7953| [45] ["Huh, so that way of thinking existed back then, too..."]
503: 7958| [45] [Right after Natsuhiko spoke, Salyu cut into the conversation.]
504: 8053| [47] [Salyu]
505: 8056| [45] ["Ena. Have non-Communicators ever used telepathy in the past?"]
506: 8061| [45] [Ena was taken aback by a student calling her by just her first name, but she still answered in good humor.]
507: 8156| [47] [Ena]
508: 8159| [45] ["Very good question, Ms. Sannomiya. It's quite rare, but it is possible depending on the situation."]
509: 8182| [47] [Ena]
510: 8185| [45] ["For example, there's the so-called 'premonition'-- like that phenomenon when someone dies that causes their family to somehow sense it from far away."]
511: 8193| [47] [Ena]
512: 8196| [45] ["What happens is that on the verge of death, survival instincts kick in, giving a temporary surge of brain functionality, which of course, includes the BC receptor as well..."]
513: 8204| [47] [Ena]
514: 8207| [45] ["The prevailing viewpoint is that the brain then transmits telepathy to the person's family.%NIn other words, it's the person's first and last use of telepathy in their life."]
515: 8302| [47] [Salyu]
516: 8305| [45] ["I see. Very interesting."]
517: 8310| [45] [Mashiro then added even more to the conversation.]
518: 8373| [47] [Mashiro]
519: 8376| [45] ["So, Ms. Ena? Does that mean that things once considered occult in the past can be explained as a sort of BC?"]
520: 8471| [47] [Ena]
521: 8474| [45] ["Exactly. That's what makes parapsychology so interesting. It's a field that scientifically elucidates all kinds of mysterious phenomena."]
522: 8500| [47] [Ena]
523: 8503| [45] ["It's no exaggeration to say that with the discovery of BC particles, every sort of occultic phenomena you can think of has become the target of scientific research."]
524: 8529| [47] [Ena]
525: 8532| [45] ["In an extreme example, some people are even considering the possibility that 'ghosts' just might be another type of BC."]
526: 8540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
527: 8543| [45] ["Huh? Ghosts?"]
528: 8569| [47] [Ena]
529: 8572| [45] ["Yes. Remember how I said that people on the verge of death have expressed telepathy even without being Communicators?"]
530: 8580| [47] [Ena]
531: 8583| [45] ["BC energy created by telepathy starts decaying after it's sent, but it's not like it fades to zero immediately."]
532: 8609| [47] [Ena]
533: 8612| [45] ["So in other words, with or without a target, extraordinarily strong BC can remain in place for a while... which means?"]
534: 8707| [47] [Mashiro]
535: 8710| [45] ["Umm, if you go to that person's place of death, you can hear their voice from when they were alive?"]
536: 8805| [47] [Ena]
537: 8808| [45] ["Exactly. Like 'curse you~' and such."]
538: 8834| [47] [Ena]
539: 8837| [45] ["Furthermore, since BC can also express emotions, the bitterness the person felt at death could accompany their voice."]
540: 8932| [47] [Salyu]
541: 8935| [45] ["... That's frightening."]
542: 8989| [47] [Mashiro]
543: 8992| [45] ["But that also means that the feelings of the dead remain in this world, doesn't it?"]
544: 9087| [47] [Ena]
545: 9090| [45] ["It sure is romantic, isn't it, Ms. Toba? But that actually might be the case."]
546: 9116| [47] [Ena]
547: 9119| [45] ["If your thoughts, memories, and spirit all exist as energy, then it's only natural for your feelings to remain in the world of the living after death, isn't it?"]
548: 9124| [45] [Ena and Mashiro smiled at each other.]
549: 9129| [47] [Natsuhiko]
550: 9130| [45] [(Geez, these two really like that sort of stuff, don't they...)]
551: 9135| [45] [As Natsuhiko mulled over the content of their conversation--]
552: 9205| [45] [Break time came to an end.]
