  1:   15| [47] [Watase]
  2:   18| [45] ["Moribe, what's wrong!? Hang in there!"]
  3:   23| [45] [Watase frantically ran over to Jun and shook her body.]
  4:   28| [47] [Jun]
  5:   29| [45] ["..."]
  6:   34| [45] [But she didn't respond no matter how much he called out to her. Her eyes were rolled back: she'd clearly lost consciousness.]
  7:   39| [45] [Instinctively sensing danger, Watase took Jun in his arms and ran back to the passageway.]
  8:  151| [47] [Yuuri]
  9:  154| [45] ["Ghh..."]
 10:  240| [47] [Ena]
 11:  243| [45] ["Gaah... agh... haah...!?"]
 12:  263| [45] [Yuuri and Ena groaned in agony and collapsed on top of each other.]
 13:  325| [47] [Watase]
 14:  328| [45] ["Yuuri! Teach!"]
 15:  333| [45] [Three of them had collapsed one after another.]
 16:  338| [45] [Kazami ran over after having noticed this unexpected turn of events.]
 17:  364| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  367| [45] ["What's wrong!?"]
 19:  372| [45] [Her face then went as pale as a sheet.]
 20:  399| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  402| [45] ["Oh no-- is this oxygen-deficient air!?"]
 22:  410| [47] [Watase]
 23:  413| [45] ["What's that!?"]
 24:  439| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  442| [45] ["A type of lethal gas that renders you unconscious in a few seconds!"]
 26:  450| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  453| [45] ["It's created when the oxygen density in the air severely decreases due to fires!"]
 28:  461| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  464| [45] ["Breathing it in puts you into a state similar to drowning on land, knocks you unconscious--%Nand at worst, kills you!"]
 30:  469| [45] [Ukita then started shouting in a shrill voice after hearing that.]
 31:  496| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  499| [45] ["Oh no! The AC in here's broken, and the ventilation can't keep up with it!"]
 33:  507| [47] [Watase]
 34:  510| [45] ["So the outer ring's full of this gas!?"]
 35:  515| [45] [The gas had been sealed in the outer ring so far because the gate had been closed up until this point, but now--]
 36:  523| [47] [Watase]
 37:  526| [45] ["We won't get any further like this!"]
 38:  531| [45] [To make matters worse, their way back was blocked by fire.]
 39:  623| [47] [Watase]
 40:  624| [45] [(There's nowhere... to run!)]
 41:  629| [45] [If Watase, Kazami, and Ukita were also to lose consciousness, it probably wouldn't be long before they were incinerated by the flames.]
 42:  634| [45] [They'd be fine if they could put out the source of the fire, but they didn't even know where it was.]
 43:  706| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  709| [45] ["..."]
 45:  714| [45] [Kazami scrunched her face in deep thinking for a second-- then she made up her mind and spoke.]
 46:  722| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  725| [45] ["We have no choice! We'll have to hold our breaths and run through the gas until we make it to the engine room!"]
 48:  733| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  736| [45] ["If the map is correct, then it's about 30 meters from here! It'll be a bit of an anaerobic exercise, but it won't be a problem!"]
 50:  744| [47] [Watase]
 51:  747| [45] ["But what do we do with the people who've fainted!?"]
 52:  773| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  776| [45] ["I'll carry Ms. Tsubakiyama! You'll take care of Moribe and Ms. Yuuri!"]
 54:  827| [47] [Watase]
 55:  828| [45] [(Two people at once!?)]
 56:  833| [47] [Watase]
 57:  834| [45] [(I'm supposed to run and hold my breath -while- carrying two people!?)]
 58:  839| [45] [That worry crossed his mind for a second, but Kazami saw through Watase's concerns and quickly appended her statement.]
 59:  847| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  850| [45] ["I know you can do it! Please have faith in yourself!"]
 61:  855| [47] [Watase]
 62:  856| [45] ["--..."]
 63:  871| [45] [Her voice filled Watase's spirit with fire. He felt self-confidence well up in him.]
 64:  879| [47] [Watase]
 65:  882| [45] ["--Got it! Leave it to me!"]
 66:  908| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  911| [45] ["That's the Captain I know."]
 68:  934| [45] [Kazami smiled for a second, then grew stern again and continued.]
 69:  947| [47] [Watase]
 70:  950| [45] ["... N-no, I can't do it! Carrying two people at once!? I just can't--"]
 71:  955| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase before he could finish.]
 72:  981| [47] [Kazami]
 73:  984| [45] ["Just do it already! Dammit, you can do this!"]
 74:  992| [47] [Watase]
 75:  995| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 76: 1021| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1024| [45] ["Uh, I mean-- I know you can do it. If you can't believe in yourself, then please believe in what I'm saying."]
 78: 1032| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1035| [45] ["..."]
 80: 1040| [45] [Her words were strangely persuasive.]
 81: 1045| [45] [And though it came a few seconds late, he felt self-confidence well up in him.]
 82: 1053| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1056| [45] ["G-got it. Leave it to me."]
 84: 1082| [47] [Kazami]
 85: 1085| [45] ["I'm counting on you!"]
 86: 1090| [45] [Kazami nodded with a stern look on her face, then turned to Ukita.]
 87: 1131| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1134| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, I apologize for asking this of you, but can you run by yourself?"]
 89: 1142| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1145| [45] ["A... all right, I'll give it a try."]
 91: 1171| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1174| [45] ["Much obliged!"]
 93: 1271| [45] [Kazami propped Ena up on her shoulder at the same time she said this.]
 94: 1277| [45] [Watase did the same with Jun, making sure to copy the way Kazami did it.]
 95: 1282| [45] [He then held Yuuri with his other hand.]
 96: 1287| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1288| [45] [(--So light!)]
 98: 1293| [45] [The two of them combined had to weigh about 100 kg. Yet they felt light to Watase.]
 99: 1301| [47] [Watase]
100: 1304| [45] ["All right! Let's go, guys!"]
101: 1338| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1341| [45] ["Yes!"]
103: 1383| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1386| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
105: 1391| [45] [The three nodded at each other, then started racing down the connecting passageway.]
106: 1506| [45] [They held their breaths through the hallways full of white smoke and oxygen-deficient air.]
107: 1511| [45] [Smoke stung their eyes, causing them to tear up.]
108: 1517| [47] [Watase]
109: 1518| [45] [(Khh... it's far...!)]
110: 1523| [45] [He'd only traveled 30 meters, but it felt extraordinarily long to him.]
111: 1528| [45] [But the weight of the two lives he bore gave Watase strength.]
112: 1533| [47] [Watase]
113: 1534| [45] [(I've gotta hang in there! If I faint, then Yuuri and Moribe die too!)]
114: 1539| [45] [As he kicked off the ground with those thoughts sprinting through him--]
115: 1554| [45] [Kazami suddenly stopped in front of a room.]
116: 1559| [47] [Watase]
117: 1560| [45] [(Did we make it!?)]
118: 1565| [45] [Kazami took a card out of her pocket and inserted it into the slot.]
119: 1641| [45] [The group filed into the room right when the door opened.]
120: 1759| [45] [There was a ladder in there, just as Ukita had said.]
121: 1764| [45] [The air in there hadn't been polluted at all.]
122: 1769| [45] [Watase quickly closed the door and took a huge breath.]
123: 1777| [47] [Watase]
124: 1780| [45] ["--Haah!"]
125: 1842| [47] [Kazami]
126: 1845| [45] ["Haah, haah...!"]
127: 1872| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1875| [45] ["*wheeze* *wheeze*..."]
129: 1880| [45] [Kazami and Ukita were also struggling to catch their breath.]
130: 1921| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1924| [45] ["Ugh...!"]
132: 1929| [45] [But Ukita fell to his knees with a thud.]
133: 1957| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1960| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, are you okay!?"]
135: 1994| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1997| [45] ["I-I have this horrible headache... It seems I inhaled a bit of the gas...!"]
137: 2008| [45] [But none of the gas had gotten in the room.]
138: 2013| [45] [They were safe for the time being-- but...]
139: 2018| [45] [Watase realized they weren't out of the woods just yet.]
140: 2023| [47] [Watase]
141: 2024| [45] [(The AD won't last much longer...!)]
142: 2035| [45] [According to his watch, it was currently "11:10 AM".]
143: 2040| [45] [Not only were there just six minutes left until their prior dosage wore off, but they didn't have any AD at all.]
144: 2045| [47] [Watase]
145: 2046| [45] [(We're screwed! Is there anything we can do!?)]
146: 2051| [45] [The manual had said that there should be spare AD in Area 3. It was very probable that it was in the outer ring.]
147: 2056| [45] [But they couldn't search the area with that gas still filling the hallways.]
148: 2061| [47] [Watase]
149: 2062| [45] [(Before we can do that, we have to find out what's keeping the sprinkler system off,%Nreactivate it, put out the source of the fire, wait for the ventilation to finish, then look for the AD--)]
150: 2067| [47] [Watase]
151: 2068| [45] [(It's useless, that'll take way too long!)]
152: 2073| [45] [But taking their time was simply not an option.]
153: 2124| [45] [Even if they got rid of the gas and restored the sprinkler system, it'd be for naught if they couldn't find AD. Everyone here would probably die.]
154: 2129| [47] [Watase]
155: 2130| [45] [(No, wait... if I die looking for the AD, then it'll all be for nothing...!)]
156: 2135| [45] [Even if they went looking for the AD after restarting the sprinkler system, it might not take as much time as expected.]
157: 2140| [45] [Then they wouldn't have to go very long without any AD. Their cumulative exposure probably wouldn't increase all that much.]
158: 2145| [47] [Watase]
159: 2146| [45] [(Should I prioritize my own safety and look toward precautions... or should I brave the danger to find AD for everyone...!?)]
160: 2162| [45] [Watase had already figured out the answer to that question.]
161: 2216| [45] [He was still hesitant.]
162: 2221| [45] [Watase silently gazed at the door.]
163: 2226| [45] [A whole hall full of potentially lethal gas was lying there. Just one sniff of it and he would most likely pass out.]
164: 2242| [47] [Watase]
165: 2243| [45] [(N-no.... it's way too dangerous...)]
166: 2248| [45] [Watase then wrung his answer out of his throat.]
167: 2256| [47] [Watase]
168: 2259| [45] ["W-we don't have a choice... let's activate the sprinkler system first. We'll look for AD after that."]
169: 2267| [47] [Watase]
170: 2270| [45] ["Tachibana, I know it'll be hard on you, but please hang in there for a little while longer."]
171: 2296| [47] [Kazami]
172: 2299| [45] ["... Yes, don't concern yourself over me. I believe you've made the correct choice."]
173: 2307| [47] [Watase]
174: 2310| [45] ["Sorry..."]
175: 2318| [47] [Watase]
176: 2321| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, could you guide us to the engine room?"]
177: 2347| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2350| [45] ["S-sure... it's right this way..."]
179: 2355| [45] [The three of them picked up their fallen companions, headed deeper into the room, then climbed the ladder.]
180: 2415| [47] [Watase]
181: 2416| [45] [(N-no... backing down is not an option!)]
182: 2424| [47] [Watase]
183: 2427| [45] ["--Tachibana! Bring everyone up the ladder!"]
184: 2453| [47] [Kazami]
185: 2456| [45] ["Captain!? What do you think you're doing!?"]
186: 2464| [47] [Watase]
187: 2467| [45] ["I'm gonna go back into the gas one more time and look for AD!"]
188: 2472| [45] [Watase said that, took a deep breath, and rushed out of the room.]
189: 2523| [47] [Kazami]
190: 2526| [45] ["Captain! Please wait, Captain!"]
191: 2531| [45] [Kazami's cries fell on deaf ears--]
