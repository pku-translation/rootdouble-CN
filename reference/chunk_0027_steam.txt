  1:   69| [47] [Watase]
  2:   72| [45] ["Moribe, what's wrong!? Hang in there!"]
  3:   77| [45] [Watase frantically ran over to Jun and shook her body.]
  4:   82| [47] [Jun]
  5:   83| [45] ["..."]
  6:   88| [45] [But she didn't respond no matter how much he called out to her. Her eyes were rolled back: she'd clearly lost consciousness.]
  7:   93| [45] [Instinctively sensing danger, Watase took Jun in his arms and ran back to the passageway.]
  8:  205| [47] [Yuuri]
  9:  208| [45] ["Ghh..."]
 10:  294| [47] [Ena]
 11:  297| [45] ["Gaah... agh... haah...!?"]
 12:  317| [45] [Yuuri and Ena groaned in agony and collapsed on top of each other.]
 13:  379| [47] [Watase]
 14:  382| [45] ["Yuuri! Teach!"]
 15:  387| [45] [Three of them had collapsed one after another.]
 16:  392| [45] [Kazami ran over after having noticed this unexpected turn of events.]
 17:  418| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  421| [45] ["What's wrong!?"]
 19:  426| [45] [Her face then went as pale as a sheet.]
 20:  453| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  456| [45] ["Oh no-- is this oxygen-deficient air!?"]
 22:  464| [47] [Watase]
 23:  467| [45] ["What's that!?"]
 24:  493| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  496| [45] ["A type of lethal gas that renders you unconscious in a few seconds!"]
 26:  504| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  507| [45] ["It's created when the oxygen density in the air severely decreases due to fires!"]
 28:  515| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  518| [45] ["Breathing it in puts you into a state similar to drowning on land, knocks you unconscious--%Nand at worst, kills you!"]
 30:  523| [45] [Ukita then started shouting in a shrill voice after hearing that.]
 31:  550| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  553| [45] ["Oh no! The AC in here's broken, and the ventilation can't keep up with it!"]
 33:  561| [47] [Watase]
 34:  564| [45] ["So the outer ring's full of this gas!?"]
 35:  569| [45] [The gas had been sealed in the outer ring so far because the gate had been closed up until this point, but now--]
 36:  577| [47] [Watase]
 37:  580| [45] ["We won't get any further like this!"]
 38:  585| [45] [To make matters worse, their way back was blocked by fire.]
 39:  677| [47] [Watase]
 40:  678| [45] [(There's nowhere... to run!)]
 41:  683| [45] [If Watase, Kazami, and Ukita were also to lose consciousness, it probably wouldn't be long before they were incinerated by the flames.]
 42:  688| [45] [They'd be fine if they could put out the source of the fire, but they didn't even know where it was.]
 43:  760| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  763| [45] ["..."]
 45:  768| [45] [Kazami scrunched her face in deep thinking for a second-- then she made up her mind and spoke.]
 46:  776| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  779| [45] ["We have no choice! We'll have to hold our breaths and run through the gas until we make it to the engine room!"]
 48:  787| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  790| [45] ["If the map is correct, then it's about 30 meters from here! It'll be a bit of an anaerobic exercise, but it won't be a problem!"]
 50:  798| [47] [Watase]
 51:  801| [45] ["But what do we do with the people who've fainted!?"]
 52:  827| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  830| [45] ["I'll carry Ms. Tsubakiyama! You'll take care of Moribe and Ms. Yuuri!"]
 54:  881| [47] [Watase]
 55:  882| [45] [(Two people at once!?)]
 56:  887| [47] [Watase]
 57:  888| [45] [(I'm supposed to run and hold my breath -while- carrying two people!?)]
 58:  893| [45] [That worry crossed his mind for a second, but Kazami saw through Watase's concerns and quickly appended her statement.]
 59:  901| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  904| [45] ["I know you can do it! Please have faith in yourself!"]
 61:  909| [47] [Watase]
 62:  910| [45] ["--..."]
 63:  925| [45] [Her voice filled Watase's spirit with fire. He felt self-confidence well up in him.]
 64:  933| [47] [Watase]
 65:  936| [45] ["--Got it! Leave it to me!"]
 66:  962| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  965| [45] ["That's the Captain I know."]
 68:  988| [45] [Kazami smiled for a second, then grew stern again and continued.]
 69: 1001| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1004| [45] ["... N-no, I can't do it! Carrying two people at once!? I just can't--"]
 71: 1009| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase before he could finish.]
 72: 1035| [47] [Kazami]
 73: 1038| [45] ["Just do it already! Dammit, you can do this!"]
 74: 1046| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1049| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 76: 1075| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1078| [45] ["Uh, I mean-- I know you can do it. If you can't believe in yourself, then please believe in what I'm saying."]
 78: 1086| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1089| [45] ["..."]
 80: 1094| [45] [Her words were strangely persuasive.]
 81: 1099| [45] [And though it came a few seconds late, he felt self-confidence well up in him.]
 82: 1107| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1110| [45] ["G-got it. Leave it to me."]
 84: 1136| [47] [Kazami]
 85: 1139| [45] ["I'm counting on you!"]
 86: 1144| [45] [Kazami nodded with a stern look on her face, then turned to Ukita.]
 87: 1185| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1188| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, I apologize for asking this of you, but can you run by yourself?"]
 89: 1196| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1199| [45] ["A... all right, I'll give it a try."]
 91: 1225| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1228| [45] ["Much obliged!"]
 93: 1325| [45] [Kazami propped Ena up on her shoulder at the same time she said this.]
 94: 1331| [45] [Watase did the same with Jun, making sure to copy the way Kazami did it.]
 95: 1336| [45] [He then held Yuuri with his other hand.]
 96: 1341| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1342| [45] [(--So light!)]
 98: 1347| [45] [The two of them combined had to weigh about 100 kg. Yet they felt light to Watase.]
 99: 1355| [47] [Watase]
100: 1358| [45] ["All right! Let's go, guys!"]
101: 1392| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1395| [45] ["Yes!"]
103: 1437| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1440| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
105: 1445| [45] [The three nodded at each other, then started racing down the connecting passageway.]
106: 1560| [45] [They held their breaths through the hallways full of white smoke and oxygen-deficient air.]
107: 1565| [45] [Smoke stung their eyes, causing them to tear up.]
108: 1571| [47] [Watase]
109: 1572| [45] [(Khh... it's far...!)]
110: 1577| [45] [He'd only traveled 30 meters, but it felt extraordinarily long to him.]
111: 1582| [45] [But the weight of the two lives he bore gave Watase strength.]
112: 1587| [47] [Watase]
113: 1588| [45] [(I've gotta hang in there! If I faint, then Yuuri and Moribe die too!)]
114: 1593| [45] [As he kicked off the ground with those thoughts sprinting through him--]
115: 1608| [45] [Kazami suddenly stopped in front of a room.]
116: 1613| [47] [Watase]
117: 1614| [45] [(Did we make it!?)]
118: 1619| [45] [Kazami took a card out of her pocket and inserted it into the slot.]
119: 1695| [45] [The group filed into the room right when the door opened.]
120: 1813| [45] [There was a ladder in there, just as Ukita had said.]
121: 1818| [45] [The air in there hadn't been polluted at all.]
122: 1823| [45] [Watase quickly closed the door and took a huge breath.]
123: 1831| [47] [Watase]
124: 1834| [45] ["--Haah!"]
125: 1896| [47] [Kazami]
126: 1899| [45] ["Haah, haah...!"]
127: 1926| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1929| [45] ["*wheeze* *wheeze*..."]
129: 1934| [45] [Kazami and Ukita were also struggling to catch their breath.]
130: 1975| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1978| [45] ["Ugh...!"]
132: 1983| [45] [But Ukita fell to his knees with a thud.]
133: 2011| [47] [Kazami]
134: 2014| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, are you okay!?"]
135: 2048| [47] [Ukita]
136: 2051| [45] ["I-I have this horrible headache... It seems I inhaled a bit of the gas...!"]
137: 2062| [45] [But none of the gas had gotten in the room.]
138: 2067| [45] [They were safe for the time being-- but...]
139: 2072| [45] [Watase realized they weren't out of the woods just yet.]
140: 2077| [47] [Watase]
141: 2078| [45] [(The AD won't last much longer...!)]
142: 2089| [45] [According to his watch, it was currently "11:10 AM".]
143: 2094| [45] [Not only were there just six minutes left until their prior dosage wore off, but they didn't have any AD at all.]
144: 2099| [47] [Watase]
145: 2100| [45] [(We're screwed! Is there anything we can do!?)]
146: 2105| [45] [The manual had said that there should be spare AD in Area 3. It was very probable that it was in the outer ring.]
147: 2110| [45] [But they couldn't search the area with that gas still filling the hallways.]
148: 2115| [47] [Watase]
149: 2116| [45] [(Before we can do that, we have to find out what's keeping the sprinkler system off,%Nreactivate it, put out the source of the fire, wait for the ventilation to finish, then look for the AD--)]
150: 2121| [47] [Watase]
151: 2122| [45] [(It's useless, that'll take way too long!)]
152: 2127| [45] [But taking their time was simply not an option.]
153: 2178| [45] [Even if they got rid of the gas and restored the sprinkler system, it'd be for naught if they couldn't find AD. Everyone here would probably die.]
154: 2183| [47] [Watase]
155: 2184| [45] [(No, wait... if I die looking for the AD, then it'll all be for nothing...!)]
156: 2189| [45] [Even if they went looking for the AD after restarting the sprinkler system, it might not take as much time as expected.]
157: 2194| [45] [Then they wouldn't have to go very long without any AD. Their cumulative exposure probably wouldn't increase all that much.]
158: 2199| [47] [Watase]
159: 2200| [45] [(Should I prioritize my own safety and look toward precautions... or should I brave the danger to find AD for everyone...!?)]
160: 2216| [45] [Watase had already figured out the answer to that question.]
161: 2270| [45] [He was still hesitant.]
162: 2275| [45] [Watase silently gazed at the door.]
163: 2280| [45] [A whole hall full of potentially lethal gas was lying there. Just one sniff of it and he would most likely pass out.]
164: 2296| [47] [Watase]
165: 2297| [45] [(N-no.... it's way too dangerous...)]
166: 2302| [45] [Watase then wrung his answer out of his throat.]
167: 2310| [47] [Watase]
168: 2313| [45] ["W-we don't have a choice... let's activate the sprinkler system first. We'll look for AD after that."]
169: 2321| [47] [Watase]
170: 2324| [45] ["Tachibana, I know it'll be hard on you, but please hang in there for a little while longer."]
171: 2350| [47] [Kazami]
172: 2353| [45] ["... Yes, don't concern yourself over me. I believe you've made the correct choice."]
173: 2361| [47] [Watase]
174: 2364| [45] ["Sorry..."]
175: 2372| [47] [Watase]
176: 2375| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, could you guide us to the engine room?"]
177: 2401| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2404| [45] ["S-sure... it's right this way..."]
179: 2409| [45] [The three of them picked up their fallen companions, headed deeper into the room, then climbed the ladder.]
180: 2469| [47] [Watase]
181: 2470| [45] [(N-no... backing down is not an option!)]
182: 2478| [47] [Watase]
183: 2481| [45] ["--Tachibana! Bring everyone up the ladder!"]
184: 2507| [47] [Kazami]
185: 2510| [45] ["Captain!? What do you think you're doing!?"]
186: 2518| [47] [Watase]
187: 2521| [45] ["I'm gonna go back into the gas one more time and look for AD!"]
188: 2526| [45] [Watase said that, took a deep breath, and rushed out of the room.]
189: 2577| [47] [Kazami]
190: 2580| [45] ["Captain! Please wait, Captain!"]
191: 2585| [45] [Kazami's cries fell on deaf ears--]
