  0:   80| [45] [--It was a memory of just a few hours ago.]
  1:   85| [45] [Salyu held Kazami's neck tight in her grip to force Watase to release Natsuhiko.]
  2:  112| [47] [Salyu]
  3:  115| [45] ["... That gun probably belonged to this man to begin with."]
  4:  120| [47] [Salyu]
  5:  123| [45] ["He used it to shoot Natsuh--"]
  6:  128| [45] [But at that moment,]
  7:  158| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  161| [45] ["--I SAID STOP!"]
  9:  195| [45] [Kazami screamed and violently shook Salyu off her.]
 10:  200| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  203| [45] ["!"]
 12:  208| [45] [Salyu's body was sent flying backwards.]
 13:  221| [45] [She then landed on the staircase--]
 14:  261| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  264| [45] ["..."]
 16:  269| [45] [The impact jolted her chest and her consciousness quickly faded.]
 17:  332| [45] [Salyu fainted as if she had fallen asleep.]
 18:  337| [45] [... In the short time she was asleep,]
 19:  342| [45] [she had a dream.]
 20:  416| [45] [--A dream of some unknown, faraway past.]
 21:  421| [45] [Someone was speaking in the corner of a cold laboratory.]
 22:  426| [47] [?]
 23:  429| [45] ["So that's Communicator A's daughter, huh..."]
 24:  434| [47] [??]
 25:  437| [45] ["She has absolutely no aptitude. We cannot confirm any influence of NBC."]
 26:  442| [47] [Salyu]
 27:  445| [45] ["Auuu~..."]
 28:  450| [45] [For some reason, Salyu couldn't move her body.]
 29:  455| [45] [She seemed to be lying down on some sort of bed, but she couldn't get up. She couldn't even talk.]
 30:  460| [45] [All she could do was listen to someone's conversation.]
 31:  465| [47] [??]
 32:  468| [45] ["It's quite plausible that she could have been infected with malice in utero..."]
 33:  473| [47] [?]
 34:  476| [45] ["We should err on the side of caution and dispose of her, shouldn't we?"]
 35:  502| [47] [Miyoko]
 36:  505| [45] ["Wh... what are you saying!?"]
 37:  531| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  534| [45] ["You people have gone mad, you know!?"]
 39:  542| [47] [Miyoko]
 40:  545| [45] ["You had a higher sense of ethics back when we were in the PRC--"]
 41:  550| [47] [?]
 42:  553| [45] ["You don't understand, Dr. Tenkawa."]
 43:  558| [47] [?]
 44:  561| [45] ["You weren't at the PRC on the night of the Great Arson."]
 45:  566| [47] [?]
 46:  569| [45] ["You didn't face the N-ified Communicator A. That's why you don't understand her ferocity."]
 47:  574| [47] [?]
 48:  577| [45] ["She probably had a third ability, beyond both telepathy and empathy."]
 49:  582| [47] [?]
 50:  585| [45] ["It felt like she was inside our heads, rewriting our minds directly... Do you even know how terrifying that is?"]
 51:  611| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  614| [45] ["..."]
 53:  619| [47] [?]
 54:  622| [45] ["Up until that point, I had thought of Communicators as people in need of protection."]
 55:  627| [47] [?]
 56:  630| [45] ["But that line of thought took a complete 180 that night."]
 57:  635| [47] [?]
 58:  638| [45] ["They're not people in need of protection at all... They're not even people. They're unmistakable monsters with inhuman power."]
 59:  643| [47] [?]
 60:  646| [45] ["I can't even hold back my fear of that girl."]
 61:  672| [47] [Miyoko]
 62:  675| [45] ["... Mr. Eriguchi, you..."]
 63:  680| [47] [Eriguchi]
 64:  683| [45] ["I what?"]
 65:  709| [47] [Miyoko]
 66:  712| [45] ["... It's nothing."]
 67:  738| [47] [Miyoko]
 68:  741| [45] ["But in any case... I cannot consent to you 'disposing' of that child."]
 69:  746| [47] [Eriguchi]
 70:  749| [45] ["Then what do you suggest we do?"]
 71:  754| [47] [Eriguchi]
 72:  757| [45] ["Naturally, we absolutely cannot consent to letting this girl loose in the outside world."]
 73:  765| [47] [Miyoko]
 74:  768| [45] ["... I'll take responsibility for her..."]
 75:  794| [47] [Miyoko]
 76:  797| [45] ["And raise her here."]
 77:  856| [45] [--That was when Salyu awoke.]
 78:  911| [47] [Salyu]
 79:  912| [45] [(... What a strange dream.)]
 80:  917| [45] [It was truly a dreamlike, unbelievable scene.]
 81:  922| [45] [Because her dream took place in LABO's neuroscience laboratory.]
 82:  927| [47] [Salyu]
 83:  928| [45] [(I went there for the first time today... and it's already in my dreams?)]
 84:  933| [45] [But nevertheless, it was a somewhat frightening dream.]
 85:  938| [45] [Salyu took a deep breath and stood up.]
 86:  943| [45] [She then began to drag her staggering body once more.]
 87:  948| [45] [In search of Natsuhiko.]
 88: 1009| [45] [--She had finally reunited with Natsuhiko, only for him to disappear somewhere again.]
 89: 1014| [47] [Salyu]
 90: 1015| [45] [(That terrorist probably has him...)]
 91: 1020| [45] [No matter how much she searched and searched for Mashiro, she couldn't find her.]
 92: 1025| [45] [Which suggested that she had safely escaped before lockdown-- At least, that was what Salyu wanted to believe.]
 93: 1030| [47] [Salyu]
 94: 1031| [45] [(... Anyway, I need to look for Natsuhiko.)]
 95: 1036| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1037| [45] [(Because it's my duty to protect him...)]
 97: 1042| [45] [She had decided to do anything to fulfill that duty.]
 98: 1110| [45] [--Which was why, when she had discovered 20 ampules of AD in the neuroscience laboratory--]
 99: 1115| [45] [She took the AD and hid it in the supply closet for the girl's restroom.]
100: 1120| [45] [She thought she'd quickly distribute the AD to Natsuhiko and Mashiro once she found them.]
101: 1125| [45] [There was a letter written by Ena by the AD, but Salyu tore it up since she couldn't trust her.]
102: 1130| [47] [Salyu]
103: 1131| [45] [(... Maybe I'm doing something cruel.)]
104: 1136| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1137| [45] [(But those guys in the orange suits are probably all terrorists.)]
106: 1142| [47] [Salyu]
107: 1143| [45] [(If Ukita's the sleeper agent, then there's a high probability that Ena's with the terrorists too.)]
108: 1148| [45] [Salyu had no chance of winning against such superior numbers.]
109: 1153| [45] [So she had no choice but to gamble on the effects of radiation weakening the enemy.]
110: 1222| [45] [Eventually, Salyu found an axe by the corpse of a terrorist.]
111: 1227| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1228| [45] [(I can finally launch a counterattack with this...)]
113: 1273| [45] [But even with that weapon, she was no match for Watase.]
114: 1278| [45] [She decided that the next time they crossed paths, she would do whatever it took to defeat him and save Natsuhiko.]
115: 1339| [45] [--Perhaps the terrorist didn't intend to kill Natsuhiko.]
116: 1344| [45] [But it was for certain that Natsuhiko was heavily injured.]
117: 1349| [47] [Salyu]
118: 1350| [45] [(... That's why I can never forgive that man.)]
119: 1355| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1356| [45] [(Because there's no way I can break my promise to protect Natsuhiko.)]
121: 1406| [45] [That promise was the only thing supporting the lonely Salyu, pushing her forward...]
