  1:   85| [45] [That night--]
  2:  142| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro told Yuuri about the incident as they gathered around the dinner table.]
  3:  289| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:  292| [45] ["... So that's what happened..."]
  5:  318| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  321| [45] ["Man, it was sooo shocking!"]
  7:  344| [45] [Despite how tense Mashiro was right after the accident, she was now back to her cheerful self, excitedly telling the tale.]
  8:  370| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  373| [45] ["And right after we realized we'd witnessed the scene of an accident, Natsuhiko suddenly used telepathy!"]
 10:  381| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  384| [45] ["Two huge events happened one after another! I was so shook up!"]
 12:  410| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  413| [45] ["Huh? Hikorin used telepathy?"]
 14:  421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  424| [45] ["Yeah... somehow I used it back then."]
 16:  450| [47] [Yuuri]
 17:  453| [45] ["Just then? You can't use it anymore?"]
 18:  479| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  482| [45] ["Seems like it. I guess it's that fight or flight response sorta thing."]
 20:  505| [45] [After Natsuhiko had seemingly gained the ability of telepathy, he tried to use it again on Mashiro on the way back.]
 21:  510| [45] [But Natsuhiko was unable to send even the feeblest of messages, much less reproduce the large-scale telepathy he used back there.]
 22:  518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  521| [45] ["Well, it's not a big deal. If there's something I want to convey, I can just convey it with my voice, after all."]
 24:  547| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  550| [45] ["Man, you really don't have any interest in BC, do you?"]
 26:  576| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  579| [45] ["I mean, you usually don't even cry sour grapes over not being able to use BC~"]
 28:  605| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  608| [45] ["Hmm... well, I don't see a problem. Talking's more fun, anyway."]
 30:  616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  619| [45] ["Got that right."]
 32:  645| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  648| [45] ["Hmm? Looks like the BC-challenged gotta stick up for each other, huh... Now you're making me feel like the odd man out."]
 34:  845| [45] [Just as Mashiro implied, Yuuri was completely incapable of using BC as well.]
 35:  850| [45] [She had Rank C Aptitude, but hadn't practiced much at all.]
 36:  855| [45] [Yuuri didn't seem to like BC all that much either, so Natsuhiko quickly tried to change the subject.]
 37:  915| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  918| [45] ["... But still, today sure was ridiculous, huh. It's really rare for accidents to happen in this city."]
 39:  960| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  963| [45] ["Sure is. I wonder how Mr. Ukita still got into an accident, though..."]
 41:  972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  975| [45] ["Beats me. Maybe there was a system error in his car's ADS?"]
 43: 1078| [45] [Rokumei City was the first city in the nation to adopt trial runs of ADS-- that is, Automatic Driving Systems.]
 44: 1083| [45] [Cars inside the city were all equipped with that system. You just entered a desired address and your car safely took you to your destination.]
 45: 1143| [47] [Mashiro]
 46: 1146| [45] ["But I thought ADS failures were exceptionally rare? I heard they have an accident rate of only 4%% compared to human drivers."]
 47: 1154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48: 1157| [45] ["Meaning it's still not 0%%, right? I guess you still can't expect perfection even if you rely on computers for everything."]
 49: 1162| [45] [Despite data suggesting automatic driving to be far safer than human operation, there was still something about it that seemed unreliable.]
 50: 1167| [45] [And when Yuuri heard this discussion-- she muttered in a trembling voice.]
 51: 1193| [47] [Yuuri]
 52: 1196| [45] ["It really is scary outside, isn't it..."]
 53: 1228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54: 1229| [45] [(!)]
 55: 1237| [45] [Natsuhiko twitched at her statement.]
 56: 1242| [45] [But without revealing so much as a hint of that gut reaction, he smiled at Yuuri and reassured her.]
 57: 1250| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58: 1253| [45] ["It's okay. There's nothing for you to worry about, Yuuri."]
 59: 1261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60: 1264| [45] ["If you just relax at home, you won't get into any danger."]
 61: 1336| [47] [Yuuri]
 62: 1339| [45] ["Mm..."]
 63: 1365| [47] [Yuuri]
 64: 1368| [45] ["Yeah, you're right."]
 65: 1376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1379| [45] ["Yeah, you're fine. Unlike -some people- who jump headfirst into danger."]
 67: 1405| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 1408| [45] ["What was that? You're not criticizing me by any chance, are you?"]
 69: 1450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1453| [45] ["I wouldn't go so far as to say I was criticizing you, but you know..."]
 71: 1461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1464| [45] ["I really don't think it's a good idea to act on impulse without any consideration for your own safety."]
 73: 1469| [45] [Mashiro's kindness was a good thing, but her lack of prudence was one of her weak points.]
 74: 1477| [47] [Mashiro]
 75: 1480| [45] ["Hah, you're just the one lacking in manliness, Natsuhiko."]
 76: 1488| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1491| [45] ["Manliness? But you're a girl, remember?"]
 78: 1499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1502| [45] ["How could I watch a girl leap into danger and -not- worry?"]
 80: 1528| [47] [Mashiro]
 81: 1531| [45] ["... You were worried?"]
 82: 1539| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1542| [45] ["Of course. You may have forgotten this, but you are a girl, at least biologically, you know?"]
 84: 1568| [47] [Mashiro]
 85: 1571| [45] ["O-oh, you're right..."]
 86: 1597| [47] [Mashiro]
 87: 1600| [45] ["Well, I'm sorry I worried you."]
 88: 1626| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1629| [45] ["But you know, you used to leap into danger a lot when you were young too, Natsuhiko."]
 90: 1637| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1640| [45] ["Huh? Well, I guess..."]
 92: 1645| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words in the face of that embarrassing point.]
 93: 1705| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1708| [45] ["Anyway, just don't do things that'll make Yuuri worry, okay?"]
 95: 1734| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1737| [45] ["Mmph..."]
 97: 1745| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1748| [45] ["Right, Yuuri? You wouldn't want Mashiro to get in danger, would you?"]
 99: 1774| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1777| [45] ["Yeah... it's not like I blame Mashiron, but..."]
101: 1803| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1806| [45] ["It's nerve-wracking to be unable to do anything but wait."]
103: 1832| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1835| [45] ["Hmm, well if you say so, Yuuri..."]
105: 1858| [45] [Mashiro politely drew back. She always heard Yuuri out.]
106: 1866| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1869| [45] ["Well, I'm sorry I worried you."]
108: 1895| [47] [Mashiro]
109: 1898| [45] ["But you know, you used to leap into danger a lot when you were young too, Natsuhiko."]
110: 1906| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1909| [45] ["Huh? Well, I guess..."]
112: 1914| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words in the face of that embarrassing point.]
113: 1949| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1952| [45] ["I'm not criticizing you, just saying it was dangerous."]
115: 1960| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1963| [45] ["Don't do things that'll make those around you worry."]
117: 1989| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1992| [45] ["Oh? What a mature viewpoint."]
119: 2018| [47] [Mashiro]
120: 2021| [45] ["But Natsuhiko, you've had your fair share of giving people heart attacks you when you were a kid, you know?"]
121: 2029| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 2032| [45] ["Huh? Well, I guess..."]
123: 2037| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words in the face of that embarrassing point.]
124: 2073| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 2076| [45] ["Indeed I am. You didn't even notice the gasoline leak. That was as dangerous as could be."]
126: 2102| [47] [Mashiro]
127: 2105| [45] ["Whoa, now that's a rude thing to say."]
128: 2131| [47] [Mashiro]
129: 2134| [45] ["I was trying my best to save Mr. Ukita..."]
130: 2142| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2145| [45] ["But if an explosion did happen, it would've been terrible for both you and Mr. Ukita, you know?"]
132: 2153| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2156| [45] ["Geez, you just don't think these things through."]
134: 2182| [47] [Mashiro]
135: 2185| [45] ["Mmgh...!"]
136: 2211| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 2214| [45] ["You sure seem full of yourself, Natsuhiko. I did nothing wrong!"]
138: 2219| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself dumbfounded as Mashiro puffed up her cheeks.]
139: 2224| [45] [Mashiro's kindness was a good thing, but her lack of prudence was one of her weak points.]
140: 2232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2235| [45] ["I really don't think it's a good idea to act on impulse without any consideration for your own safety."]
142: 2261| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 2264| [45] ["Hmph! Natsuhiko, you used to be a boy like that too you know!"]
144: 2272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2275| [45] ["Huh? Well, I guess..."]
146: 2280| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words in the face of that embarrassing point.]
147: 2327| [45] [Yuuri smiled and started speaking again.]
148: 2335| [47] [Yuuri]
149: 2338| [45] ["That's true~ Hikorin used to be a mischievous boy too."]
150: 2364| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 2367| [45] ["Whenever he found danger, he'd happily leap into it~"]
152: 2375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2378| [45] ["True, I guess I was like that in the past, but..."]
154: 2383| [45] [As Natsuhiko answered, he recalled his childhood days.]
155: 2502| [45] [--A scene about a decade old.]
156: 2513| [45] [Back in those days, Natsuhiko was something of a leader among the children.]
157: 2556| [45] [If there was anything interesting, he'd leap right into it without any regard for danger.]
158: 2561| [45] [If he saw a kid getting bullied, he'd go through any lengths to protect them, even if it meant facing a bully bigger than him.]
159: 2566| [45] [And uncharacteristic of a boy his age-- he was a kid who would play with girls even if it meant other boys making fun of him.]
160: 2668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 2671| [45] ["Hey, Yuuri! Mashiro! Let's go out and play!"]
162: 2676| [45] [Two young girls responded to the young Natsuhiko's voice.]
163: 2702| [47] [Mashiro]
164: 2705| [45] ["Okay. Where?"]
165: 2731| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 2734| [45] ["Let's go to the park~ I met a cute puppy there the other day~"]
167: 2742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2745| [45] ["Okay, so today we go look for that doggy. Follow me, you two!"]
169: 2885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2888| [45] ["Where are you, doggy? Doggy~ If you can hear me, say so!"]
171: 2952| [47] [Yuuri]
172: 2955| [45] ["Hikorin, it's not like he can answer you."]
173: 2997| [47] [Mashiro]
174: 3000| [45] ["Okay then, Natsuhiko. Wanna have a competition to see who can find him first?"]
175: 3008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 3011| [45] ["Oh, then how about the loser has to do what the winner says?"]
177: 3037| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 3040| [45] ["Geez, you two always make a competition out of everything..."]
179: 3161| [45] [Brat Boss Natsuhiko and Tomboy Mashiro had something of a boyish rivalry.]
180: 3166| [45] [Since they both always lived in the same neighborhood in Rokumei City, they were already acquainted before they could remember.]
181: 3225| [45] [And once Yuuri moved in, the three of them quickly became friends.]
182: 3230| [45] [--They had many friends, but they most enjoyed playing with just the three of them.]
183: 3336| [45] [They would go on faraway tests of courage.]
184: 3413| [47] [Yuuri]
185: 3416| [45] ["Uuugh, I'm scared..."]
186: 3459| [47] [Mashiro]
187: 3462| [45] ["I-I-I-I-It's okay, Yuuri! I'm here for you!"]
188: 3470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 3473| [45] ["Mashiro, your voice is trembling~"]
190: 3580| [45] [--Or practice BC together.]
191: 3621| [47] [Yuuri]
192: 3624| [45] ["Hmm, hmm..."]
193: 3650| [47] [Mashiro]
194: 3653| [45] ["... Haaah! It's no use, Natsuhiko. I can't do telepathy."]
195: 3661| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 3664| [45] ["Don't give up! Let's try hard until we can!"]
197: 3770| [45] [--They didn't just play outside, either. They'd also visit each other's houses.]
198: 3796| [47] [Mashiro]
199: 3799| [45] ["Pardon the intrusion!"]
200: 3825| [47] [Mashiro]
201: 3828| [45] ["Wah! Natsuhiko, your house is soooo big!"]
202: 3897| [47] [Yuuri]
203: 3900| [45] ["Hey, hey, what should we play?"]
204: 3908| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 3911| [45] ["Pogs! Or maybe tops!"]
206: 3938| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 3941| [45] ["That's so old-fashioned, Natsuhiko! Let's watch anime! 'Beyond*BEYOND' is airing right now!"]
208: 3967| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 3970| [45] ["Hmm... how about we all read a book together? I'm sure the professor has lots."]
210: 3996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3999| [45] ["Then we can play with tops while we watch anime and read a book..."]
212: 4025| [47] [Mashiro]
213: 4028| [45] ["We can't do all that at once!"]
214: 4054| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 4057| [45] ["That's so greedy, Hikorin~"]
216: 4080| [45] [Yuuri was two years older than the other two, but the age difference was inconsequential.]
217: 4126| [45] [Their hobbies and personalities were all over the place, but the three of them were always together.]
218: 4137| [45] [As long as they were all together, they had fun no matter what they did.]
219: 4375| [45] [--And their relationship continued even now.]
220: 4380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 4381| [45] [(The boys were really dead set on making fun of me back then, huh...)]
222: 4386| [45] [But thanks to his perseverance, he was able to build the interpersonal relationships he had now.]
223: 4391| [45] [The familial relationships one builds from childhood are nigh irreplaceable.]
224: 4396| [45] [And that's exactly why one can both scold someone and worry about them at the same time.]
225: 4421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 4424| [45] ["Well, now that I think about it, I was only doing it to show off to everyone."]
227: 4450| [47] [Mashiro]
228: 4453| [45] ["Really? I quite enjoyed it myself, though."]
229: 4461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 4464| [45] ["But still, peace and quiet really is the best. There's no point in putting yourself in danger."]
231: 4472| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 4475| [45] ["It's because we have this peace in our lives that we can eat delicious dinners like this, after all."]
233: 4501| [47] [Mashiro]
234: 4504| [45] ["Hmm... well, I guess you're right."]
235: 4509| [45] [Mashiro's mood seemed to more or less improve after being praised for her cooking.]
236: 4514| [45] [And naturally, Yuuri joined in too.]
237: 4540| [47] [Yuuri]
238: 4543| [45] ["Hey, Mashiron. This fish is super delicious."]
239: 4551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 4554| [45] ["Sure is. What kind of fish is this?"]
241: 4580| [47] [Mashiro]
242: 4583| [45] ["Ah, that's hairtail. I tried to carefully cook its crumbly meat a la meuniere."]
243: 4609| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 4612| [45] ["You're amazing, Mashiron. Your cooking skill's been improving every day."]
245: 4620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 4623| [45] ["Sure is. You can even put a pro to shame now."]
247: 4649| [47] [Mashiro]
248: 4652| [45] ["Nah, you flatter me... but I love it! Flatter me more!"]
249: 4691| [45] [With a simple change of topic, the smiles returned to the dinner table.]
250: 4696| [45] [Natsuhiko found such peaceful times to be the most pleasant...]
