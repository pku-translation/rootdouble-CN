  0:   51| [55] [âˆšCurrent Chapter 2]
  1:   68| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   69| [45] [(...)]
  3:   74| [45] [Trap, bomb, gun, dud--]
  4:   79| [45] [The quick succession of events left Natsuhiko dumbfounded.]
  5:  162| [45] [It was then that Jun and Ukita came rushing in one after another.]
  6:  188| [47] [Jun]
  7:  191| [45] ["Ah, Captain, Ms. Tsubakiyama!"]
  8:  317| [47] [Ukita]
  9:  320| [45] ["I heard a most peculiar sound! What happened!?"]
 10:  326| [45] [Watase looked at Ena's hands in surprise to see the black luster of a pistol.]
 11:  373| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  376| [45] ["M-Ms. Tsubakiyama...!"]
 13:  384| [47] [Jun]
 14:  387| [45] ["Wh-what are... what are you doing with a pistol!?"]
 15:  419| [45] [But Natsuhiko's surprise was incomparable to theirs.]
 16:  424| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  425| [45] [(Why... Why would Prof. Tsubakiyama have a gun...???)]
 18:  430| [45] [His doubts about Ena rapidly deepened.]
 19:  512| [45] [--She didn't offer Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu any help when they asked for her cooperation.]
 20:  517| [45] [Mashiro said that she wasn't opening her heart to them.]
 21:  522| [45] [But while that may have been true, it wasn't as if Natsuhiko had grown to hate Ena.]
 22:  527| [45] [In Natsuhiko's eyes, Ena was at times gentle, at time strict, and at times charming--%Nan all around good teacher.]
 23:  532| [45] [And yet here she was, holding a pistol.]
 24:  537| [45] [She was a completely different Ena from the one Natsuhiko had known.]
 25:  547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  548| [45] [(Professor... what on Earth are you?)]
 27:  553| [45] [As soon as he had that thought, he recalled the gruesome scene he saw earlier.]
 28:  784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  785| [45] [(N-no, no, no! Prof. Tsubakiyama isn't a killer!)]
 30:  790| [45] [As Natsuhiko shook off that doubt that'd plagued him for just a moment, Ukita and Jun began to interrogate Ena.]
 31:  816| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  819| [45] ["What's the meaning of this!? Why do you have something like that with you!?"]
 33:  845| [47] [Jun]
 34:  848| [45] ["Yeah! I thought you were a teacher!"]
 35:  874| [47] [Ena]
 36:  877| [45] ["Hold on a minute, you're all making a big misunderstanding!"]
 37:  903| [47] [Ena]
 38:  906| [45] ["This pistol isn't mine! I found it here in LABO!"]
 39:  911| [45] [That sounded like a lazy excuse, but Watase told everyone to believe in her.]
 40:  937| [47] [Jun]
 41:  940| [45] ["Wait, you believe her?"]
 42:  948| [47] [Watase]
 43:  951| [45] ["Well, we can't prove otherwise, so yeah, nothing we can do about that."]
 44:  956| [45] [Eventually, at Watase's suggestion, they disassembled the gun and divided the parts between Ukita, Ena, and Jun.]
 45:  961| [45] [But that still didn't clear Natsuhiko's reservations.]
 46: 1134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47: 1135| [45] [(... Professor...)]
 48: 1140| [45] [As Watase and the others moved towards Area 6 to chase after Salyu, a somewhat lonely breeze blew through Natsuhiko's mind.]
