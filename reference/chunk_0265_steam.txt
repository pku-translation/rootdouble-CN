  1:   82| [45] [--Once they finally arrived at the infirmary, Watase and Kazami began Natsuhiko's blood transfusion.]
  2:   90| [47] [Watase]
  3:   93| [45] ["... How's his condition? Think he can pull through?"]
  4:  119| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  122| [45] ["His respiration and pulse are extremely feeble. But his vital signs are just barely stable--"]
  6:  148| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  151| [45] ["I can't make any guesses as to how it'll turn out in the end, but I think he'll just pull through if we keep the transfusion going."]
  8:  156| [45] [Though Natsuhiko was relieved to hear Kazami's words-- he couldn't help but think.]
  9:  161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  162| [45] [(Still... how did I survive for so long in that state...?)]
 11:  167| [45] [Now that it had been established that there was no nuclear reactor in Area N, he understood that his body had not been affected by radiation.]
 12:  172| [45] [But Natsuhiko had been inflicted with such serious wounds that put him at such obvious risk for death from blood loss.]
 13:  177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  178| [45] [(Could it possibly have something to do with how I've been connected with Watase through BC this entire time?)]
 15:  183| [45] [He had no other hunches.]
 16:  188| [45] [But he did remember what he learned in class a few days ago.]
 17:  193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  194| [45] [(Now that I think about it... when we practiced telepathy in the BC room, didn't Prof. Tsubakiyama say...)]
 19:  282| [47] [Ena]
 20:  285| [45] ["The most important thing for BC is-- without a doubt, 'concentration'!"]
 21:  293| [47] [Ena]
 22:  296| [45] ["Unlike the other five senses, you need concentration that transcends common sense if you want to draw out the 'sixth sense'!"]
 23:  322| [47] [Ena]
 24:  325| [45] ["It's said that the concentration necessary for BC use is so extreme that it causes the five senses to dampen in turn."]
 25:  333| [47] [Ena]
 26:  336| [45] ["In certain cases, even vital signs like body temperature and pulse can drop..."]
 27:  362| [47] [Ena]
 28:  365| [45] ["Once you reach that state of concentration, a new power will awaken in your brain, opening the door to the world of BC."]
 29:  456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  457| [45] [(... I see. I get it now.)]
 31:  462| [45] [--When using BC, depending on the situation, the five senses can dampen and vital signs like breathing and pulse can decrease.]
 32:  467| [45] [All the answers were there.]
 33:  472| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  473| [45] [(Ever since I lost consciousness back then, I've been connected to Watase through BC.)]
 35:  478| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  479| [45] [(So in other words, my brain's been concentrating this entire time for the continuous use of BC.)]
 37:  484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  485| [45] [(And as a result, my body's respiration and pulse have decreased dramatically--)]
 39:  490| [45] [When Natsuhiko had used long-distance telepathy on Mashiro, his face had gone pale.]
 40:  495| [45] [Use of BC's "third ability" likely required even more extreme concentration from the brain.]
 41:  500| [45] [Enough to cause the body to go into hibernation--]
 42:  505| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  506| [45] [(I see... so that's how my body was able to minimize blood loss despite being shot by Watase so many times.)]
 44:  511| [45] [By the time Natsuhiko finally reached that conclusion, a sound rang out from behind Watase.]
 45:  693| [45] [Watase turned around-- and found Ukita standing in the doorway to the infirmary.]
 46:  719| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  722| [45] ["Well well, if it isn't Captain Kasasagi and Lieutenant Tachibana."]
 48:  748| [47] [Ukita]
 49:  751| [45] ["I thought I heard noises coming from here. What might you two be up to?"]
