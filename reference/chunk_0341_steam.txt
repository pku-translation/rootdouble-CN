  0:   57| [45] [--When Natsuhiko looked into those memories--]
  1:   62| [45] [He saw scenes comprising Jun's entire life appear and disappear.]
  2:   67| [45] [--Everything had changed one day nine years ago--]
  3:  132| [45] [Jun had been playing with Kazami's sister "Nagisa" in a park.]
  4:  166| [47] [Nagisa]
  5:  169| [45] ["Hey Jun, what do you wanna play?"]
  6:  177| [47] [Jun]
  7:  180| [45] ["Oh, I know, how 'bout we play house?"]
  8:  185| [45] [Nagisa, who was five years younger than Jun, was like a little sister to her.]
  9:  192| [45] [Not long after they started playing, Kazami walked over.]
 10:  225| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  228| [45] ["Jun. I'm so sorry you had to watch over Nagisa for me."]
 12:  236| [47] [Jun]
 13:  239| [45] ["Oh, Kazami. Nah, it's cool, I was having fun too."]
 14:  244| [45] [--Kazami had yet to become a rescue worker at the time.]
 15:  249| [45] [She was just a calm and kind older sister who worked at a flower shop.]
 16:  308| [45] [The three of them got along extremely well... almost like Jun was one of their sisters too.]
 17:  313| [45] [Though she wasn't related to them in any way, they were still closer than family.]
 18:  322| [45] [She wished they could all stay that way forever--]
 19:  379| [45] [But their happiness was suddenly robbed from them.]
 20:  384| [45] [One day, when Jun went over to Kazami and Nagisa's apartment to visit--]
 21:  530| [45] [A large gas explosion damaged the apartment complex.]
 22:  535| [45] [Kazami was still at work at the time, so only Jun and Nagisa were caught up in the accident.]
 23:  595| [45] [Jun managed to survive--]
 24:  600| [45] [But Nagisa had suffered a serious head injury as a result of the accident, and passed away...]
 25:  661| [47] [Buddhist Priest]
 26:  664| [45] ["--not created, not annihilated, not impure, not pure, not increasing, not decreasing. Therefore, in the void"]
 27:  675| [47] [Buddhist Priest]
 28:  678| [45] ["there are no forms and no feelings, conceptions, impulses and no consciousness: there is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind; there is no form, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea--..."]
 29:  683| [45] [On the day of Nagisa's funeral-- Jun just stood there in a daze as she listened to the priest chant his sutras.]
 30:  688| [47] [Jun]
 31:  689| [45] [(Nagisa's... dead...)]
 32:  694| [47] [Jun]
 33:  695| [45] [(... The tears... just won't come...)]
 34:  700| [45] [She still couldn't believe that Nagisa had died.]
 35:  705| [45] [But Kazami's sorrow was far greater than Jun's.]
 36:  713| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  716| [45] ["Nagisa..."]
 38:  721| [45] [Kazami was staring at Nagisa's casket with empty eyes.]
 39:  726| [45] [Naturally, Nagisa didn't respond.]
 40:  731| [45] [Jun felt her heart wrench as she watched Kazami...]
 41:  785| [45] [--Nagisa's death changed Kazami and Jun's lives forever.]
 42:  790| [45] [Kazami cursed her own powerlessness for failing to save her sister--]
 43:  795| [45] [And so to atone for that, she quit her job at the flower shop and worked to become a rescue worker.]
 44:  800| [45] [She probably wished to save others' lives in place of the deceased sister she felt she had failed to save.]
 45:  805| [45] [Jun understood how Kazami felt, but it still worried her.]
 46:  810| [47] [Jun]
 47:  811| [45] [(Sis has this slightly fragile side to her...)]
 48:  816| [47] [Jun]
 49:  817| [45] [(... I've gotta watch over her.)]
 50:  822| [45] [It wasn't long before Jun acted on those feelings, following in Kazami's footsteps by becoming a rescue worker as well.]
 51:  887| [45] [--Then on August 1, 2030, Jun was made a member of the rescue team under Watase Kasasagi's command.]
 52:  892| [45] [She then easily completed several dispatches, waiting for the opportunity to truly shine.]
 53:  944| [45] [It wasn't long before that opportunity came knocking.]
 54:  949| [45] [--September 16, early morning.]
 55: 1009| [45] [The ear-splitting scream of a dispatch siren screeched through the station.]
 56: 1014| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have occurred in the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization."]
 57: 1020| [45] [And with that ominous report-- the curtain rose on the longest day of Jun's life.]
 58: 1076| [45] [She and the rest of the team lined up in LABO's entrance hall, garbed in protection suits.]
 59: 1084| [47] [Kazami]
 60: 1087| [45] ["Captain! All members of Team A present and accounted for!"]
 61: 1095| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1098| [45] ["Excellent. Listen up, people!"]
 63: 1106| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1109| [45] ["Countless people are trapped in this lab as we speak!"]
 65: 1117| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1120| [45] ["And due to the nature of this facility, this will be no ordinary dispatch."]
 67: 1128| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1131| [45] ["We don't know what will happen here, nor what unforeseen circumstances await us."]
 69: 1139| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1142| [45] ["..."]
 71: 1147| [45] [Jun gulped behind her faceplate.]
 72: 1152| [47] [Jun]
 73: 1153| [45] [(Unforeseen circumstances...!)]
 74: 1158| [45] [Radiation exposure, radiation damage, and death-- those phrases all clouded her head.]
 75: 1163| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1164| [45] [(If our cold as ever Captain is the one saying this... then this dispatch must really be serious.)]
 77: 1169| [45] [Jun braced herself as she thought that--]
 78: 1220| [45] [But unforeseen problems far beyond her wildest dreams kept happening one after another.]
 79: 1285| [45] [They lost contact with Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama.]
 80: 1354| [45] [They damaged their protection suits.]
 81: 1420| [45] [Lastly, Jun and Kazami were trapped in LABO's basement due to the declaration of the "Case N".]
 82: 1468| [45] [--Despite that, the two rescue workers combined their efforts to look for survivors and an escape route.]
 83: 1473| [45] [But they weren't able to find either. And just as they were about to finish searching Areas 2 and 1--]
 84: 1529| [47] [Jun]
 85: 1532| [45] ["... Ah! That's--"]
 86: 1565| [47] [Kazami]
 87: 1568| [45] ["Is that the Captain!?"]
 88: 1573| [45] [They found Watase lying in a hallway in Area 1.]
 89: 1580| [45] [The three rescue workers then began their long and arduous battle through the facility...]
 90: 1610| [45] [--At that moment--]
 91: 1615| [45] [A floral scent suddenly wafted in from somewhere.]
 92: 1620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1621| [45] [(The floral scent...!)]
 94: 1626| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1627| [45] [(The memories after this point were tampered with!)]
 96: 1651| [47] [Yuuri]
 97: 1654| [45] [{Ms. Jun should go back to normal if you repair those memories!}]
 98: 1659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1660| [45] [(Yeah!)]
100: 1709| [45] [Natsuhiko agreed, resuming memory access.]
101: 1714| [45] [His search criterion was-- "floral-scented memories".]
