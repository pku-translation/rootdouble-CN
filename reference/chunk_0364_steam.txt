  0:   95| [55] [√Double Chapter 5]
  1:  219| [47] [Watase]
  2:  222| [45] ["Gaagh... agh...!"]
  3:  227| [45] [--The rope wrapped around his neck was digging into his throat.]
  4:  258| [45] [Kazami put all her strength into her grip as she strangled Watase from behind.]
  5:  263| [45] [She had apparently taken the rescue rope Watase had left in Area 6's inner ring and brought it with her.]
  6:  268| [45] [All for the sake of killing Watase.]
  7:  321| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  324| [45] ["It hurts, doesn't it...? Then I'll put you to rest soon...!"]
  9:  329| [45] [Kazami's voice sounded pained.]
 10:  334| [45] [Though Watase was barely conscious, he was still able to make that out.]
 11:  347| [47] [Watase]
 12:  348| [45] [(... Why...?)]
 13:  353| [47] [Watase]
 14:  354| [45] [(What does Kazami think I did to her...!?)]
 15:  359| [45] [Kazami then spoke right after Watase had that thought.]
 16:  364| [45] [It was almost like she read his mind.]
 17:  372| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  375| [45] ["You don't understand...? I'm doing this all for you."]
 19:  395| [45] [He could never understand.]
 20:  400| [45] [Kazami's deranged thoughts were beyond Watase's comprehension.]
 21:  405| [45] [When he realized he was about to die without understanding a thing--]
 22:  410| [45] [Watase heard a voice in the corner of his mind.]
 23:  467| [85] [{--... se.}]
 24:  468| [86] [???]
 25:  469| [86] [{--... se.}]
 26:  497| [47] [Watase]
 27:  498| [45] [(... An auditory hallucination...!?)]
 28:  503| [45] [No, that wasn't it.]
 29:  635| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  638| [45] [{Watase! Wha... rong, ... you okay!?}]
 31:  643| [45] [It was telepathy from Natsuhiko.]
 32:  648| [45] [His voice was faint due to all the white noise filtering it out, but Watase could just barely make out his concerned shouts.]
 33:  653| [47] [Watase]
 34:  654| [45] [(Na... Natsuhiko...!)]
 35:  679| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  682| [45] [{... chibana!? Ms. Tachibana is trying to kill...--...!?}]
 37:  687| [47] [Watase]
 38:  688| [45] [(Y... yeah...)]
 39:  713| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  716| [45] [{Hang in... -... Prof. Tsubakiyama and Jun...--... be there soon!}]
 41:  721| [45] [Watase tried to hold out for them, but it didn't look like they'd make it in time.]
 42:  726| [47] [Watase]
 43:  727| [45] [(I'm... sorry...)]
 44:  732| [45] [Watase mentally apologized to him.]
 45:  737| [47] [Watase]
 46:  738| [45] [(It looks like... this is the end of the line... for me...!)]
 47:  763| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  766| [45] [{Wha...!}]
 49:  791| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  794| [45] [{What're you apologizing for!? Are you giving up!?}]
 51:  858| [47] [Watase]
 52:  859| [45] [(... N... o... But I really... don't think... I can hold out... anymore...)]
 53:  864| [47] [Watase]
 54:  865| [45] [(Everything's... going black...)]
 55:  887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  890| [45] [{--onsense! Are you...--planning on letting it end after a--...}]
 57:  895| [47] [Watase]
 58:  896| [45] [(I don't want to either... but I just can't...)]
 59:  902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  905| [45] [{--ugh with that shit! We need...-- it'll be a huge pain in the ass for us if you die--...}]
 61:  910| [47] [Watase]
 62:  911| [45] [(Sorry... but you'll need to find yet another pawn--)]
 63:  922| [45] [But when Watase thought that,]
 64:  927| [45] [he heard another voice.]
 65:  935| [47] [Jun]
 66:  938| [45] ["C-Captain!"]
 67:  961| [47] [Watase]
 68:  964| [45] ["!!"]
 69:  969| [45] [--This was no mental voice. It was actually coming from a person's throat.]
 70:  974| [45] [Kazami's strength loosened at that moment.]
 71: 1057| [45] [Watase could make out Jun and Ena in corner of his eye. They were about 5 m away from him and Kazami.]
 72: 1083| [47] [Ena]
 73: 1086| [45] ["Stop it, Ms. Tachibana!"]
 74: 1191| [45] [Ena took out her gun and pointed it at Kazami.]
 75: 1199| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1202| [45] ["Oh, a gun, huh...? So you're in league with Watase too!?"]
 77: 1210| [47] [Ena]
 78: 1213| [45] ["It doesn't matter if I am or not!"]
 79: 1221| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1224| [45] ["Just let go of Captain Kasasagi already! Or else I'll shoot!"]
 81: 1308| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1311| [45] ["Then please go on ahead. I'll put an end to Watase's life before you do."]
 83: 1319| [47] [Ena]
 84: 1322| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 85: 1330| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1333| [45] ["So long as you don't shoot me in the head, I'll have cut off his breathing before I die."]
 87: 1341| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1344| [45] ["Wh-what're you talking about, Sis!?"]
 89: 1352| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1355| [45] ["What, you ask? Isn't it obvious?"]
 91: 1384| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1387| [45] ["I'm saying I'm going to kill Watase."]
 93: 1395| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1398| [45] ["Wha... That can't be! Why!?"]
 95: 1406| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1409| [45] ["In order to protect his good name."]
 97: 1414| [45] [Kazami answered Jun's question.]
 98: 1422| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1425| [45] ["You see, Jun, this man is a terrorist."]
100: 1433| [47] [Jun]
101: 1436| [45] ["Huh...?"]
102: 1494| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1497| [45] ["It's his fault all those people died today."]
104: 1552| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1555| [45] ["The one who killed those five people-- was none other than Watase."]
106: 1563| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1566| [45] ["He was supposed to be a hero, and yet he..."]
108: 1632| [47] [Watase]
109: 1633| [45] [(S... so that's it...!)]
110: 1638| [45] [Watase finally understood what Kazami had been talking about.]
111: 1643| [45] [He managed to wring his voice out of his nearly crushed throat.]
112: 1651| [47] [Watase]
113: 1654| [45] ["Ka... Kazami..."]
114: 1662| [47] [Watase]
115: 1665| [45] ["You... realized that I was a terrorist..."]
116: 1673| [47] [Watase]
117: 1676| [45] ["So you're trying to kill me before my crimes can come to light!?"]
118: 1684| [47] [Kazami]
119: 1687| [45] ["Yes."]
120: 1695| [47] [Kazami]
121: 1698| [45] ["Didn't I say from the start that there were no terrorists?"]
122: 1706| [47] [Kazami]
123: 1709| [45] ["That's the way it should be. You will die not as a terrorist, but as a rescue worker."]
124: 1717| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1720| [45] ["'Watase Kasasagi, Captain of Sirius' Team A, passed away in the line of duty in an accident at LABO'--"]
126: 1728| [47] [Kazami]
127: 1731| [45] ["That is the 'truth' that will be revealed to the world once the lockdown ends."]
128: 1739| [47] [Kazami]
129: 1742| [45] ["So in order to prevent your sins from being revealed... you must die here."]
130: 1747| [45] [A faint thought entered Watase's head when he heard Kazami finish rambling to herself.]
131: 1808| [47] [Watase]
132: 1809| [45] [(Yeah... maybe that wouldn't be so bad either...)]
133: 1814| [45] [That way, at least he wouldn't sully the good name of Sirius.]
134: 1819| [45] [That way, the truth about Dojima and Hiyama would most likely be lost to the world.]
135: 1824| [45] [Then the following story would be printed on tomorrow's paper:]
136: 1862| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
137: 1865| [45] [--"Three Rescue Workers Killed on Duty in Nuclear Research Facility Accident"--]
138: 1869| [85] [ %N]
139: 1872| [85] [ %N]
140: 1875| [45] [--"These brave men died honorably to save the lives of trapped civilians."--]
141: 1901| [45] [People would then accept those distorted facts as the truth.]
142: 1906| [45] [Just like how they were all lied to about the truth behind the fire 16 years ago.]
143: 1911| [45] [Then there would be no problems for anyone aside from those directly involved.]
144: 1916| [47] [Watase]
145: 1917| [45] [(... Maybe it's the perfect way for me to atone for my sins.)]
146: 1922| [47] [Watase]
147: 1923| [45] [(If that's what Kazami wants too, then...)]
148: 1928| [45] [But at that moment,]
149: 1988| [85] [{The hell are you saying, dumbass!?}]
150: 1989| [86] [Natsuhiko]
151: 1990| [86] [{The hell are you saying, dumbass!?}]
152: 2005| [85] [{Are you planning on breaking your promise to Yuuri!?}]
153: 2006| [86] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2007| [86] [{Are you planning on breaking your promise to Yuuri!?}]
155: 2035| [47] [Watase]
156: 2036| [45] [(-----!!)]
157: 2041| [45] [Those words spurred Watase back into action.]
158: 2102| [47] [Watase]
159: 2105| [45] ["KAZAMIIIIII!"]
160: 2124| [47] [Kazami]
161: 2127| [45] ["!?"]
162: 2132| [45] [Kazami's hands trembled the moment Watase shouted.]
163: 2138| [45] [This caused her to slightly loosen her grip on the rope, allowing Watase to pull on it with all his might.]
164: 2150| [45] [Jun dashed forward at the same time.]
165: 2155| [45] [She took her army knife out,]
166: 2167| [45] [and cut the rope.]
167: 2235| [47] [Watase]
168: 2238| [45] ["Ack, aaaaaah! *cough* *cough* *cough*!"]
169: 2243| [45] [Watase coughed violently, feeling all of the pressure on his throat suddenly relent.]
170: 2269| [47] [Jun]
171: 2272| [45] ["Yes!!"]
172: 2277| [45] [Jun shouted in victory.]
173: 2282| [45] [But Kazami let go of the rope at the exact same time--]
174: 2315| [47] [Kazami]
175: 2318| [45] ["Don't interfere!!"]
176: 2323| [45] [--and pushed Jun away with all her strength.]
177: 2411| [47] [Jun]
178: 2414| [45] ["Agh!"]
179: 2419| [45] [Jun's small body was sent flying hard into the wall.]
180: 2427| [47] [Jun]
181: 2430| [45] ["..."]
182: 2441| [45] [She then slowly collapsed to the floor.]
183: 2467| [45] [A crack then sharply echoed through the air.]
184: 2475| [47] [Watase & Kazami]
185: 2478| [45] ["!!"]
186: 2527| [45] [Watase and Kazami looked at Ena in shock.]
187: 2532| [45] [Ena had apparently fired a bullet towards Kazami's feet.]
188: 2540| [47] [Ena]
189: 2543| [45] ["That's your last warning shot!"]
190: 2610| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2613| [45] ["...!!"]
192: 2618| [45] [Hesitation rose to Kazami's face for a second--]
193: 2672| [45] [She then picked up Subject N's body and ran off.]
194: 2749| [47] [Ena]
195: 2752| [45] ["Hold it!"]
196: 2757| [45] [Ena moved to pursue Kazami, but Watase immediately called for her to stop.]
197: 2765| [47] [Watase]
198: 2768| [45] ["Teach, don't!"]
199: 2795| [47] [Ena]
200: 2798| [45] ["Huh!?"]
201: 2806| [47] [Watase]
202: 2809| [45] ["Y-you don't have to follow her... It's too dangerous to chase her all alone..."]
203: 2835| [47] [Ena]
204: 2838| [45] ["But Captain Kasasagi--!"]
205: 2846| [47] [Watase]
206: 2849| [45] ["That's enough. We should be more worried about Moribe now."]
207: 2866| [45] [Watase looked over at Jun.]
208: 2954| [45] [She was lying out limply on the floor. She had apparently hit her head.]
209: 2968| [47] [Watase]
210: 2971| [45] ["... Let's just take Moribe with us and regroup with the others."]
211: 2979| [47] [Watase]
212: 2982| [45] ["It'll be better for us to stay in a group."]
213: 3057| [47] [Ena]
214: 3058| [45] ["..."]
215: 3063| [45] [Ena fell silent at the same time they heard Kazami running for Area 1.]
216: 3068| [45] [After a short silence, Watase heard Natsuhiko's telepathy echo in his head.]
217: 3134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 3137| [45] [{--... se, are you okay?}]
219: 3142| [47] [Watase]
220: 3143| [45] [(Yeah, somehow...)]
221: 3167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3170| [45] [{...--I've also--... --firmed the situati...--}]
223: 3175| [47] [Watase]
224: 3176| [45] [(I see. Kazami's been completely consumed by the malice... How're things on your end?)]
225: 3200| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3203| [45] [{We met up with Salyu--...-- e wasn't infected with...--}]
227: 3227| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3230| [45] [{--... egroup in the control room and figure out what to do n--....}]
229: 3235| [47] [Watase]
230: 3236| [45] [(The control room? Got it. I'll be heading over there with Teach and Moribe.)]
231: 3251| [45] [Watase finished answering him, then turned to Ena.]
232: 3259| [47] [Watase]
233: 3262| [45] ["Let's go, Teach. We'll rendezvous with Natsuhiko and the others in the control room."]
234: 3288| [47] [Ena]
235: 3291| [45] ["... Yes."]
236: 3296| [45] [Ena finally nodded.]
237: 3307| [45] [Watase then carried Jun on his back and started making his way for Area 4.]
