  0:  155| [55] [√After Chapter 3]
  1:  171| [45] [Watase ran through the poisonous air.]
  2:  176| [45] [He kept his breath held completely all the while.]
  3:  181| [45] [He believed that there was AD in one of the several offices that lined the outer ring.]
  4:  239| [45] [The first room-- yielded no luck.]
  5:  331| [45] [But there was an iron box lying in the second room.]
  6:  429| [47] [Watase]
  7:  430| [45] [(A medical box!)]
  8:  435| [45] [Watase ran over to it and opened it up.]
  9:  444| [45] [Inside of it was--]
 10:  449| [45] [some AD.]
 11:  454| [45] [But only two ampules of it.]
 12:  459| [47] [Watase]
 13:  460| [45] [(This isn't enough!!)]
 14:  466| [45] [Watase shoved the AD in his pocket and tossed the medical box aside.]
 15:  471| [45] [He needed four more to keep everyone, especially Kazami, alive.]
 16:  476| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth and ran into the next room.]
 17:  570| [45] [But there was no AD to be found there, nor in the room after that, or even in the room after that one.]
 18:  575| [47] [Watase]
 19:  576| [45] [(Goddammit, there's nothing here!)]
 20:  581| [45] [Going through a second round of anaerobic exercise was particularly harsh on Watase.]
 21:  586| [45] [Though it was still easier than when he'd been carrying Jun and Yuuri.]
 22:  591| [47] [Watase]
 23:  592| [45] [(This would be so much easier if I could just breathe...!)]
 24:  597| [45] [His lungs were seeking oxygen so desperately that his heart felt like it was going to explode.]
 25:  602| [45] [He put up with it and entered the next room--]
 26:  787| [45] [Only to be greeted by the swaying of flames.]
 27:  792| [45] [Pitch black smoke spread, sending a striking pain through his eyes.]
 28:  797| [47] [Watase]
 29:  798| [45] [(Great, so not only do I have to hold my breath, but now I'm against fire!?)]
 30:  803| [45] [If there was any AD in there, he had to get it now or it would be incinerated.]
 31:  808| [45] [But Watase could very well lose his life for real searching in a place like this.]
 32:  820| [47] [Watase]
 33:  821| [45] [(--No, I can do this!)]
 34:  875| [45] [Watase's heart let out a scream.]
 35:  880| [47] [Watase]
 36:  881| [45] [(I can't hold out much longer... can I make it!?)]
 37:  898| [47] [Watase]
 38:  899| [45] [(--No, I can do this!)]
 39:  904| [45] [Watase steeled his resolve and stood his ground.]
 40:  909| [45] [He wiped his tears and looked around carefully.]
 41: 1007| [45] [And soon enough-- he spotted a medical box in a gap between the flames!]
 42: 1012| [47] [Watase]
 43: 1013| [45] [(Is there anything in it!?)]
 44: 1018| [45] [He frantically ran over to the box.]
 45: 1027| [45] [Inside of it were--]
 46: 1032| [45] [five ampules of AD.]
 47: 1037| [47] [Watase]
 48: 1038| [45] [(Yes! They're here!!)]
 49: 1044| [45] [Watase grabbed the box and took it with him.]
 50: 1049| [45] [He then mustered his strength and fled from the room.]
 51: 1154| [45] [--But he didn't have any strength left.]
 52: 1164| [45] [His consciousness was fading from oxygen deprivation.]
 53: 1169| [45] [His feet were as heavy as lead, and tears filled his eyes, distorting his line of sight.]
 54: 1174| [47] [Watase]
 55: 1175| [45] [(Dammit... I've hit... my limit...!)]
 56: 1180| [45] [Watase walked through the darkness, still holding his breath.]
 57: 1185| [47] [Watase]
 58: 1186| [45] [(Let me...)]
 59: 1191| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1192| [45] [(Let me get this AD to everyone, if nothing else...!)]
 61: 1197| [45] [He leaned against the wall and fumbled his way down the hall.]
 62: 1202| [45] [But before long-- his hand came into contact with something soft.]
 63: 1207| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1208| [45] [(... A hand?)]
 65: 1213| [45] [Someone's hand was firmly gripping Watase's.]
 66: 1218| [45] [Watase wiped his tears and looked in front of him.]
 67: 1242| [45] [Kazami was standing there.]
 68: 1247| [47] [Watase]
 69: 1248| [45] [(Tachi... bana...)]
 70: 1253| [45] [He called out to her in a voice that wasn't a voice.]
 71: 1276| [45] [Kazami also wordlessly replied to him. She appeared to have said "Captain".]
 72: 1281| [45] [Kazami lent Watase her shoulder-- and then broke off into a mad dash.]
 73: 1363| [45] [They reached the room with the ladder and practically dived into it.]
 74: 1425| [45] [Both of them took deep breaths once the door was closed.]
 75: 1433| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1436| [45] ["Haaaaaaaaaaaah!"]
 77: 1462| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1465| [45] ["Haah, haah... whew..."]
 79: 1491| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1494| [45] ["... Captain, are you all right?"]
 81: 1502| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1505| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 83: 1510| [45] [Watase took out the AD he'd retrieved as he continued to pant.]
 84: 1518| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1521| [45] ["More importantly, take this... it's AD."]
 86: 1529| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1532| [45] ["... Now... we can save... everyone..."]
 88: 1558| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1561| [45] ["...!"]
 90: 1566| [45] [Kazami gave him a pointed look.]
 91: 1574| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1577| [45] ["I'm sorry... guess I made you worry about me again, huh?"]
 93: 1582| [45] [Watase was prepared to face another scolding from her.]
 94: 1587| [45] [But instead-- Kazami gave him a sweet smile.]
 95: 1613| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1616| [45] ["Sheesh, you really are always so reckless...!"]
 97: 1624| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1627| [45] ["Y-you're not going to scold me?"]
 99: 1653| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1656| [45] ["I don't endorse heroics, but... I cannot deny that your actions deserve merit this time."]
101: 1664| [47] [Watase]
102: 1667| [45] ["Is... that right...? That's good."]
103: 1675| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1678| [45] ["Yes."]
105: 1683| [45] [Kazami said that and held her hand out to Watase.]
106: 1694| [45] [It was right at that moment that Kazami's watch alarm went off.]
107: 1721| [47] [Kazami]
108: 1724| [45] ["It's time to administer the AD. Let's go upstairs."]
109: 1732| [47] [Watase]
110: 1735| [45] ["R-right."]
111: 1783| [45] [Watase took Kazami's hand and climbed up the ladder.]
112: 1788| [45] [And soon enough--]
113: 1842| [45] [they reached the engine room.]
114: 1847| [45] [Jun, Yuuri, and Ena were already lying there, and Ukita was sitting next to them.]
115: 1855| [47] [Watase]
116: 1858| [45] ["All right, then let's administer AD to everyone."]
117: 1920| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1923| [45] ["Let's split up the work. Let me have three of them."]
119: 1928| [45] [Watase and Kazami soon began injecting everyone.]
120: 1970| [45] [First Jun, then Ukita, then Ena, then Yuuri--]
121: 1987| [45] [And last, they injected themselves.]
122: 2013| [47] [Kazami]
123: 2016| [45] ["Next, let's do a vitals check."]
124: 2049| [45] [Kazami then removed her Vital Checker and wrapped it around everyone's wrists one by one.]
125: 2054| [45] [Watase watched with bated breath as she checked everyone's blood pressure and temperature--]
126: 2059| [45] [only for her to finish and start speaking with a relieved tone of voice.]
127: 2085| [47] [Kazami]
128: 2088| [45] ["... Check completed. Everyone checks out as green."]
129: 2114| [47] [Kazami]
130: 2117| [45] ["They're all unconscious, but I believe they'll recover soon enough."]
131: 2122| [45] [Watase then breathed a huge sigh of relief.]
132: 2130| [47] [Watase]
133: 2133| [45] ["Haah... thank God everyone's okay..."]
134: 2141| [47] [Kazami]
135: 2144| [45] ["Yes. So it should be all right for us to rest a while."]
136: 2152| [47] [Watase]
137: 2155| [45] ["They don't need any antidotes or anything?"]
138: 2181| [47] [Kazami]
139: 2184| [45] ["Oxygen-deficient air is extremely harmful to humans, but it's not poisonous. They should be all right if they keep inhaling fresh air."]
140: 2192| [47] [Watase]
141: 2195| [45] ["Good, then you stay here and look after the others. I'll take this time to start up this sprinkler system."]
142: 2221| [47] [Kazami]
143: 2224| [45] ["But where is it? This place is like a maze..."]
144: 2229| [45] [Kazami examined her surroundings.]
145: 2234| [45] [Just as she'd said, there were various sized pipes and pieces of equipment strewn all over the place. It was difficult to tell where -anything- was here.]
146: 2242| [47] [Watase]
147: 2245| [45] ["Is there a blueprint to this place or anything like that...?"]
148: 2250| [45] [He looked around with that thought in mind, and eventually spotted a machine with a small monitor on it located by the ladder.]
149: 2276| [47] [Kazami]
150: 2279| [45] ["What's that?"]
151: 2284| [45] [Watase and Kazami ran up to the machine and found the following written on the screen.]
152: 2352| [45] [<Engine Room Engineer Terminal Menu>]
153: 2355| [85] [　]
154: 2358| [45] [* Electronics Manuals Screen]

156: 2364| [45] [* Work Management Screen]

158: 2370| [45] [* Editing Screen]
159: 2373| [85] [　%N　%N]
160: 2376| [45] [(Please touch the screen you wish to view.)]
161: 2402| [45] [--It appeared they were electronics manuals for the staff who supervised the engine room.]
162: 2407| [45] [Watase decided to tap the "Electronics Manuals" bar first, causing the contents of the screen to change.]
163: 2440| [45] [<Electronics Manuals Screen Menu>]
164: 2443| [85] [　]
165: 2446| [45] ["WX particle amplifier operation manual"]

174: 2473| [45] [...]
175: 2502| [47] [Watase]
176: 2505| [45] ["Can't really tell what each one does from the titles alone."]
177: 2531| [47] [Kazami]
178: 2534| [45] ["What's this 'WX particle amplifier operation manual' one?"]
179: 2539| [45] [Kazami pressed that section, changing the screen yet again.]
180: 2583| [45] [It drew up a graph of a cylindrical machine, along with the manual's table of contents.]
181: 2588| [45] [But there wasn't anything important listed in it.]
182: 2615| [47] [Kazami]
183: 2618| [45] ["... Doesn't look like it has anything to do with the sprinkler system, does it?"]
184: 2626| [47] [Watase]
185: 2629| [45] ["Dammit, is there no sprinkler system manual?"]
186: 2634| [45] [Watase tried to fiddle around with the screen some more, but then--]
187: 2714| [47] [Ukita]
188: 2717| [45] ["W-wait..."]
189: 2722| [45] [Ukita called out in a pained voice as he kept sitting on the floor.]
190: 2730| [47] [Watase]
191: 2733| [45] ["Mr. Ukita? You okay?"]
192: 2801| [47] [Ukita]
193: 2804| [45] ["Y-yes... somehow."]
194: 2809| [45] [Ukita stood up and shook his head.]
195: 2835| [47] [Ukita]
196: 2838| [45] ["... More importantly, I know where the sprinkler system is. They showed it to me during my orientation days, you see."]
197: 2864| [47] [Ukita]
198: 2867| [45] ["It's further in. I'll guide you there."]
199: 2875| [47] [Watase]
200: 2878| [45] ["I see. That'd be great."]
201: 2904| [47] [Kazami]
202: 2907| [45] ["We apologize for inconveniencing you, but we'll kindly take you up on your offer."]
203: 2912| [45] [Ukita nodded and started walking on unsteady feet.]
204: 2917| [45] [Watase followed him with a similar stumble in his steps.]
