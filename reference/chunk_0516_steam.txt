  0:   53| [45] [--After Yuuri had come across Watase and he knocked her out--]
  1:   64| [45] [--Yuuri was woken up by a strange sound and an extreme heat.]
  2:  147| [47] [Yuuri]
  3:  150| [45] ["Mm, mmm..."]
  4:  158| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  161| [45] ["H... Hikorin..."]
  6:  166| [45] [For a moment, she remembered the time she was locked away in LABO with Natsuhiko, so she unthinkingly called out his name.]
  7:  171| [45] [But she was mistaken. It was currently September 16, 2030, nine years after that memory.]
  8:  176| [45] [Yuuri looked around. She didn't see the man, but--]
  9:  199| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  202| [45] ["Aah...!"]
 11:  207| [45] [The hallway was engulfed in flames.]
 12:  212| [45] [The fires had probably spread while she was unconscious.]
 13:  220| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  223| [45] ["I... I gotta get away...!"]
 15:  234| [45] [Yuuri stood up in confusion and ran away from the flames.]
 16:  239| [45] [As she ran, Yuuri thought to herself.]
 17:  244| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  245| [45] [(How long have I been unconscious?)]
 19:  250| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  251| [45] [(Where did that man go!?)]
 21:  256| [45] [The man had disappeared after knocking Yuuri out.]
 22:  261| [45] [From that observation, she couldn't understand what his goal was at all.]
 23:  266| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  267| [45] [(No, there's no time to think about all of that! First, I need to find a way to survive!)]
 25:  316| [45] [Yuuri shook off her doubts and ran through the hallway.]
 26:  365| [45] [On the way, she stopped by a room and obtained a Lv. 6 security card that had been left behind.]
 27:  419| [45] [She tried going to Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa's office, but saw no sign of Natsuhiko and the others.]
 28:  424| [45] [They probably escaped by their own means.]
 29:  429| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  430| [45] [(Thank goodness...)]
 31:  458| [45] [Right when Yuuri sighed in relief, the flames assailed her.]
 32:  466| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  469| [45] ["Kyah!"]
 34:  474| [45] [Yuuri kept running as the fire and smoke chased her.]
 35:  532| [45] [She went through the blazing factory--]
 36:  610| [45] [And then into Area 1.]
 37:  615| [45] [But there were no escape routes to be found.]
 38:  631| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  634| [45] ["Ah, ah, ah...!"]
 40:  640| [45] [There was no longer any way out.]
 41:  645| [45] [Every path she took was blocked by fire.]
 42:  653| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  656| [45] ["That room..."]
 44:  661| [45] [Yuuri plunged into a nearby room, every fiber of her being focused only on escaping from the flames.]
 45:  747| [45] [She lowered her body and crawled under a desk so as to not breathe in the smoke.]
 46:  752| [45] [But she could tell it was only a matter of time before that room burned up too.]
 47:  803| [47] [Yuuri]
 48:  804| [45] [(Ah... Am I going to die here...?)]
 49:  851| [45] [She thought that might not be such a bad thing.]
 50:  856| [45] [Even if she were to survive, she probably would still never make it out of LABO.]
 51:  861| [45] [As long as Natsuhiko and the others managed to escape in the end, that was probably good enough for her.]
 52:  866| [47] [Yuuri]
 53:  867| [45] [(That's right... the lie we kept telling is now coming true. That's all.)]
 54:  951| [45] [And with this, Yuuri would disappear in both name and in substance.]
 55:  956| [45] [The curse that haunted Natsuhiko and Mashiro would slip out of existence.]
 56:  961| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  962| [45] [(This is for the best... It wouldn't even have been strange if I actually had died long ago, anyway.)]
 58: 1017| [47] [Yuuri]
 59: 1018| [45] [(Because if Hikorin didn't use telepathy back then, I would've died.)]
 60: 1023| [47] [Yuuri]
 61: 1024| [45] [(So these nine extra years were more like a bonus, if anything...)]
 62: 1076| [47] [Yuuri]
 63: 1077| [45] [(I'm glad I was able to stay with them for a little longer, even if it was just as a phantom...)]
 64: 1082| [45] [She kept telling herself that, and when she finally readied herself--]
 65: 1090| [45] [And with that thought, Yuuri prepared herself, but then--]
 66: 1269| [45] [She heard an explosion from outside the room.]
 67: 1277| [47] [Yuuri]
 68: 1280| [45] ["Kyaahh!!"]
 69: 1293| [45] [Yuuri couldn't help but scream.]
 70: 1298| [45] [The door to the room was crushed and flames rushed in.]
 71: 1303| [45] [And then, the force of the flames fiercely intensified. Perhaps something explosive had caught on fire.]
 72: 1319| [47] [Yuuri]
 73: 1322| [45] ["A-aah..."]
 74: 1333| [45] [The heat was so intense that it was difficult to breathe.]
 75: 1338| [45] [A heat haze rose from the entire floor, warping the sight of Yuuri's surroundings.]
 76: 1343| [45] [As she watched the haze, all of the preparation Yuuri had made to accept her death--]
 77: 1348| [45] [--turned into fear.]
 78: 1364| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1367| [45] ["N-no..."]
 80: 1375| [47] [Yuuri]
 81: 1378| [45] ["No, no, no... I don't want to die... I don't want to die...!"]
 82: 1383| [45] [She kept screaming in solitude.]
 83: 1388| [45] [The fear of actual impending death blew away what little resolve to die Yuuri thought she had.]
 84: 1393| [45] [A heat wave blew through like a windstorm.]
 85: 1398| [45] [Smoke filled the room.]
 86: 1421| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1424| [45] ["*cough*! *cough*!"]
 88: 1429| [45] [Yuuri coughed violently. Her eyes watered.]
 89: 1434| [45] [But then-- she heard voices from somewhere in the distance.]
 90: 1454| [47] [???]
 91: 1457| [45] ["Get a hose ready!"]
 92: 1465| [47] [???]
 93: 1468| [45] ["Roger!"]
 94: 1488| [47] [Yuuri]
 95: 1489| [45] [(!?)]
 96: 1494| [45] [They were female voices.]
 97: 1502| [47] [???]
 98: 1505| [45] ["Whoa-- outta the way, Captain!"]
 99: 1513| [47] [???]
100: 1516| [45] ["Commence water release!"]
101: 1524| [47] [???]
102: 1527| [45] ["Roger! Here it comes!!"]
103: 1532| [45] [Judging by their conversation, they seemed to be firefighters or something.]
104: 1537| [45] [When Yuuri lifted her head, she heard the sound of water coming from the other side of the crushed door.]
105: 1548| [45] [They were extinguishing the fires outside.]
106: 1553| [45] [The violent heat wave rapidly died down.]
107: 1558| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1559| [45] [(Th-there's no doubt about it... They're firefighters!)]
109: 1567| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1570| [45] ["S-someone..."]
111: 1578| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1581| [45] ["He... help me...!"]
113: 1586| [45] [She heard a voice in response.]
114: 1594| [47] [???]
115: 1597| [45] ["Someone's... in that room!?"]
116: 1602| [45] [Yuuri called out once more to whomever it was that was rushing over to her.]
117: 1610| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1613| [45] ["Someone... help... me..."]
119: 1618| [45] [And finally, the owner of the footsteps came running into the room.]
120: 1652| [47] [???]
121: 1655| [45] ["Are you okay!?"]
122: 1660| [45] [Yuuri desperately reached out her hand.]
123: 1665| [45] [But as soon as she made eye contact with the owner of the voice--]
124: 1694| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1697| [45] ["--!?"]
126: 1702| [45] [Yuuri gasped in shock.]
127: 1791| [45] [Standing there was the man who had just attacked her earlier.]
128: 1796| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1797| [45] [(Why!? Why did he come to save me!?)]
130: 1802| [45] [She was thoroughly confused and understood nothing of the situation.]
131: 1840| [45] [The man's face stiffened too for some reason, and he froze in place.]
132: 1845| [45] [Meanwhile, the fires drew closer to Yuuri.]
133: 1850| [45] [Eventually the man shot off like a bullet--]
134: 1882| [45] [--straight into the room to save Yuuri.]
135: 2091| [45] [--Yuuri went back through her memories countless times, and in the process, she reaffirmed her feelings in detail.]
136: 2096| [45] [Her feelings for Natsuhiko and the others.]
137: 2101| [45] [And-- her feelings for "her".]
138: 2106| [45] [The girl who was truly isolated, unable to interact with anybody.]
139: 2111| [45] [As Yuuri thinks about that girl's existence, a new memory rises up from the innermost depths of her mind...]
