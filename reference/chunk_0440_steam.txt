  0:   65| [45] [--It was a story of when Natsuhiko and Mashiro had gotten along and had also become friends with Yuuri--]
  1:  118| [45] [Mashiro had come with the other two to a ruined building on the outskirts of town as part of a test of courage.]
  2:  154| [45] [Yuuri muttered with a quivering voice as she walked next to Mashiro.]
  3:  215| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:  218| [45] ["Uuugh, I'm scared..."]
  5:  223| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  226| [45] ["I-I-I-I-It's okay, Yuuri! I'm here for you!"]
  7:  295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  298| [45] ["Mashiro, your voice is trembling~"]
  9:  303| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  306| [45] ["Shut up, Natsuhiko! I'm not scared at all!"]
 11:  311| [45] [Actually, she was.]
 12:  316| [45] [But to hide her fear, she deliberately tried to speak cheerfully.]
 13:  321| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  324| [45] ["Anyway, Natsuhiko, what kinda building did this used to be?"]
 15:  350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  353| [45] ["A hospital."]
 17:  379| [47] [Mashiro & Yuuri]
 18:  382| [45] ["A hospital?"]
 19:  408| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  411| [45] ["There was a fire here years ago, see. I think somebody might have died."]
 21:  419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  422| [45] ["And I think that person's ghost might pop up here..."]
 23:  448| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  451| [45] ["So I'm thinking if that ghost finds living people, it might possess them...!"]
 25:  512| [47] [Yuuri]
 26:  515| [45] ["Eek...!"]
 27:  541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  544| [45] ["It's one of Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, you know. The rumor that a ghost appears here, I mean."]
 29:  570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  573| [45] ["I know a guy who knows a guy who saw it, so it might be real..."]
 31:  634| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  637| [45] ["...!"]
 33:  642| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  645| [45] ["I-I-I-I-It's okay, Yuuri! I'm here for you!"]
 35:  671| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  674| [45] ["Mashiro, you already said that--"]
 37:  679| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  682| [45] ["Sh-shut up, Natsuhiko!"]
 39:  708| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  711| [45] ["Heheheh, well, whatever. How about we make a few rounds around this place?"]
 41:  737| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  740| [45] ["You can wait outside by yourself if you want to though, Mashiro..."]
 43:  745| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  748| [45] ["Hmph! No way! We came all the way out here, so it'd be a waste not to go in!"]
 45:  753| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  756| [45] ["C'mon, let's go, Yuuri!"]
 47:  782| [47] [Yuuri]
 48:  785| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 49:  790| [45] [Mashiro grabbed Yuuri by the hand and started walking in an effort to distract herself from her fear.]
 50:  963| [45] [... An uncanny atmosphere filled the silent facility.]
 51:  968| [45] [Even Natsuhiko's initial enthusiasm faded into silence.]
 52: 1006| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53: 1007| [45] ["..."]
 54: 1012| [47] [Yuuri]
 55: 1013| [45] ["..."]
 56: 1018| [47] [Mashiro]
 57: 1019| [45] ["..."]
 58: 1024| [45] [The silent air sent fear into Mashiro's heart once again.]
 59: 1035| [47] [Mashiro]
 60: 1036| [45] [(... Someone... died... here...!?)]
 61: 1041| [47] [Mashiro]
 62: 1042| [45] [(H-hmph! That's probably just another one of Natsuhiko's lies!)]
 63: 1047| [47] [Mashiro]
 64: 1048| [45] [(There's no such thing as ghosts! That's so un-science-ific!)]
 65: 1053| [47] [Mashiro]
 66: 1054| [45] [(No such thing as ghosts, no such thing as ghosts, no such thing as ghosts...)]
 67: 1059| [45] [As Mashiro kept telling herself that--]
 68: 1064| [45] [She felt as if she heard a voice.]
 69: 1128| [85] [{...--...--... give up...}]
 70: 1129| [86] [???]
 71: 1130| [86] [{...--...--... give up...}]
 72: 1173| [47] [Mashiro]
 73: 1176| [45] ["!?"]
 74: 1181| [45] [Mashiro's heart pounded.]
 75: 1186| [45] [When she stopped in surprise, the others gasped.]
 76: 1218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1221| [45] ["Wh-what happened!?"]
 78: 1247| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1250| [45] ["D-did something happen!?"]
 80: 1255| [47] [Mashiro]
 81: 1258| [45] ["W-well, I thought I just heard..."]
 82: 1263| [45] [But before Mashiro could finish, the voice once again--]
 83: 1321| [85] [{You have to keep-- ...--...til... bitter end...}]
 84: 1322| [86] [Ghost?]
 85: 1323| [86] [{You have to keep-- ...--...til... bitter end...}]
 86: 1338| [85] [{If you wanna die, you can do that later!}]
 87: 1339| [86] [Ghost?]
 88: 1340| [86] [{If you wanna die, you can do that later!}]
 89: 1395| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1398| [45] ["!!--"]
 91: 1403| [45] [Rather than hearing it with her ears, it felt more like it was echoing right in her head.]
 92: 1408| [45] [Mashiro was overcome with surprise for a moment-- and then she screamed.]
 93: 1413| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1416| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!"]
 95: 1421| [45] [That voice caused Natsuhiko and Yuuri to scream one after the other as well.]
 96: 1482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1485| [45] ["Waaaaahh!?"]
 98: 1546| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1549| [45] ["Kyaaahhh!"]
100: 1554| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1557| [45] ["Ukkyaahhhh!"]
102: 1663| [45] [Mashiro screamed again and made a mad dash for the exit.]
103: 1668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1671| [45] ["H-hey, wait, Mashiro!"]
105: 1676| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1679| [45] ["Mashiron, wait! Mashiron!!"]
107: 1684| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri screamed as they chased after her. Mashiro just kept running without looking back.]
108: 1738| [45] [--Once they were outside, Natsuhiko and Yuuri finally caught up to her.]
109: 1743| [45] [When they asked her what happened, Mashiro lied to keep up appearances.]
110: 1748| [45] ["I tried messing around with you guys to try and surprise you."]
111: 1753| [45] [Yuuri tearfully said "Mashiron, you're so mean..." while Natsuhiko grumbled.]
112: 1758| [45] [Mashiro regretted lying, but it was too late to back down on it.]
113: 1763| [45] [And so the truth of the ghost slipped away into the darkness...]
