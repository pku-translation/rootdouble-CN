  1:   98| [45] [------]
  2:  103| [45] [----]
  3:  108| [45] [--]
  4:  113| [45] [--And then, the visions within the memories faded--]
  5:  181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  184| [45] ["--...!"]
  7:  189| [45] [Natsuhiko returned to reality as if he had woken up from a dream.]
  8:  194| [45] [Before his eyes was a crying Mashiro, pushed against the wall.]
  9:  199| [45] [Apparently only a fleeting moment had passed in reality.]
 10:  204| [45] [But Natsuhiko had experienced nine years of her life-- and he shed endless tears.]
 11:  212| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  215| [45] ["N... Natsuhiko?"]
 13:  220| [45] [Mashiro called out in confusion.]
 14:  225| [45] [But once he heard that voice,]
 15:  233| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  236| [45] ["...!"]
 17:  241| [45] [Natsuhiko silently brought her into a deep embrace.]
 18:  365| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  368| [45] ["!?"]
 20:  373| [45] [He could feel her body tensing up.]
 21:  378| [45] [But Natsuhiko embraced her even stronger as he spoke.]
 22:  386| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  389| [45] ["Mashiro...!"]
 24:  397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  400| [45] ["I'm sorry...! I'm so sorry...!"]
 26:  408| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  411| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 28:  419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  422| [45] ["You've always been there to support me, haven't you..."]
 30:  430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  433| [45] ["You've always been there for me, right by my side...!"]
 32:  438| [45] [Mashiro gasped at those words.]
 33:  446| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  449| [45] ["H-how did you...!?"]
 35:  457| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  460| [45] ["I'm sorry I did it without asking... but I read your memories with BC...!"]
 37:  468| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  471| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 39:  479| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  482| [45] ["My memories? Is that even...!?"]
 41:  490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  493| [45] ["It is. I did it. It has to be some sort of new BC ability."]
 43:  501| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  504| [45] ["But I wanted to know how you felt so bad, and then--"]
 45:  512| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  515| [45] ["I saw your memories of nine years up until today."]
 47:  563| [47] [Mashiro]
 48:  566| [45] ["...!"]
 49:  574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  577| [45] ["And now I know everything. How my mind shattered when I lost Yuuri."]
 51:  585| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  588| [45] ["And how you were always there watching over me..."]
 53:  596| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  599| [45] ["That too...!?"]
 55:  607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  610| [45] ["Yeah, and so I wanted to say..."]
 57:  615| [45] [Natsuhiko paused there.]
 58:  620| [45] [He desperately held back his overwhelming emotions and squeezed out the words.]
 59:  628| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  631| [45] ["... Thank you."]
 61:  639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  642| [45] ["... Thank you so much, Mashiro..."]
 63:  647| [45] [Tears came spilling out again.]
 64:  652| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled the words Yuuri's phantom had whispered to him six days ago.]
 65:  740| [47] [Yuuri]
 66:  743| [45] ["So don't distrust those around you."]
 67:  751| [47] [Yuuri]
 68:  754| [45] ["... If you must distrust someone, then distrust me."]
 69:  762| [47] [Yuuri]
 70:  765| [45] ["No matter what's the truth and what's a lie, you should be in the company of those with good intentions, shouldn't you?"]
 71:  835| [45] [--What Yuuri said was true.]
 72:  840| [45] [Natsuhiko had always been protected by the people around him.]
 73:  845| [45] [For nine whole years.]
 74:  850| [45] [And then, Mashiro--]
 75:  898| [47] [Mashiro]
 76:  901| [45] ["It's okay..."]
 77:  906| [45] [Mashiro had that to say to him.]
 78:  914| [47] [Mashiro]
 79:  917| [45] ["You know, I've been worried this whole time..."]
 80:  925| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81:  928| [45] ["... Worried?"]
 82:  936| [47] [Mashiro]
 83:  939| [45] ["Yeah... I was worried that once you noticed the truth, the same thing that happened to you nine years ago would happen again."]
 84:  944| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85:  945| [45] ["..."]
 86:  953| [47] [Mashiro]
 87:  956| [45] ["... But it didn't."]
 88:  964| [47] [Mashiro]
 89:  967| [45] ["You were able to accept the sadness."]
 90:  975| [47] [Mashiro]
 91:  978| [45] ["And I'm happy just for that..."]
 92:  986| [47] [Mashiro]
 93:  989| [45] ["Natsuhiko... you did well to withstand it..."]
 94:  997| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1000| [45] ["... You worked so hard..."]
 96: 1005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1006| [45] ["..."]
 98: 1011| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head at those words.]
 99: 1019| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1022| [45] ["Mashiro... The only reason I could withstand it was because of you."]
101: 1030| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1033| [45] ["Because you... were always there by my side..."]
103: 1041| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1044| [45] ["... Yuuri was the one by your side, wasn't she?"]
105: 1052| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1055| [45] ["No. Thanks to you, I...--"]
107: 1060| [45] [He had no more words.]
108: 1065| [45] [He just embraced Mashiro tightly once more.]
109: 1070| [45] [An embrace filled with nine years of feelings.]
110: 1118| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1121| [45] ["Natsuhiko..."]
112: 1129| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1132| [45] ["... I'm glad I could be there for you."]
114: 1137| [45] [Mashiro returned the embrace.]
115: 1180| [45] [They remained in each others arms for a while.]
116: 1185| [45] [Without words. Without BC--]
117: 1245| [45] [--How much time had they spent in each others arms after that?]
118: 1304| [45] [Eventually, Natsuhiko let go of Mashiro and spoke up.]
119: 1312| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1315| [45] ["... Let's go, Mashiro."]
121: 1323| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 1326| [45] ["Yeah..."]
123: 1334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1337| [45] ["It's my duty to get you out of here... And that's a duty I swear I'll fulfill."]
125: 1363| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 1366| [45] ["But what about the card...?"]
127: 1374| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1377| [45] ["... There should be one in this area. I don't know how I know, but trust me."]
129: 1382| [45] [--Yuuri's phantom said that Natsuhiko had merely overlooked it.]
130: 1387| [45] [He decided to trust in her words.]
131: 1392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1393| [45] [(Remember... I must've seen it.)]
133: 1398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1399| [45] [(Where have I been where I've already seen a card!?)]
135: 1404| [45] [As soon as he pondered that question--]
136: 1464| [45] [--a card's location flickered in his mind as if in a flashback.]
137: 1542| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1545| [45] ["--The stairwell next door! Let's go look, Mashiro!"]
139: 1571| [47] [Mashiro]
140: 1574| [45] ["Y-Yeah!"]
141: 1628| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro rushed out of the room and dashed to the stairwell.]
142: 1678| [45] [It was dark because the light had been broken.]
143: 1738| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro stared hard as they searched for the card together.]
144: 1784| [45] [And eventually, hidden in the pile of rubble-- Natsuhiko spotted a rectangular object.]
145: 1792| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 1795| [45] ["!! Found one!"]
147: 1821| [47] [Mashiro]
148: 1824| [45] ["Huh!?"]
149: 1829| [45] [Mashiro looked at the card Natsuhiko had picked up.]
150: 1915| [45] [Written on it was the name "Miyoko Tenkawa" and the letters "Lv. N".]
151: 1923| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1926| [45] ["Mom's card...? Why is it here?"]
153: 1954| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 1957| [45] ["Maybe she dropped it when she evacuated?"]
155: 1962| [45] [They couldn't know the details. However--]
156: 1967| [45] [Natsuhiko felt it was as if Yuuri had left them with this card.]
157: 1975| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1978| [45] ["In any case, I'm sure we can use this to open the security gate!"]
159: 2004| [47] [Mashiro]
160: 2007| [45] ["True! Let's try it out immediately!"]
161: 2015| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 2018| [45] ["Yeah!"]
163: 2023| [45] [They dashed out of the stairwell.]
164: 2111| [45] [And they arrived at the gate that had been blocking their way.]
165: 2116| [45] [Natsuhiko swiped their newly found card through the gate's card slot.]
166: 2124| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2127| [45] ["Please work..."]
168: 2153| [47] [Mashiro]
169: 2156| [45] ["... Please."]
170: 2161| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro huddled up and prayed.]
171: 2166| [45] [...]
172: 2171| [45] [...]
173: 2176| [45] [...]
174: 2181| [45] [... And as if their prayer had reached heaven--]
175: 2270| [45] [The gate slowly opened before them.]
176: 2278| [47] [Mashiro]
177: 2281| [45] ["...!"]
178: 2286| [45] [Mashiro looked at Natsuhiko with gleaming eyes.]
179: 2294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 2297| [45] ["All right...! There's sure to be an emergency escape in Area 6 this way."]
181: 2323| [47] [Mashiro]
182: 2326| [45] ["You can tell?"]
183: 2334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2337| [45] ["We escaped through Area 6 nine years ago."]
185: 2342| [45] [A complicated smile formed across Mashiro's face as she heard those words.]
186: 2390| [45] [Natsuhiko himself felt sad as he looked back at the way they came.]
187: 2395| [45] [--Back at Area 5, where he and Yuuri had been trapped that fateful day.]
188: 2400| [45] [And the same place where Yuuri's illusion had vanished.]
189: 2453| [45] [But there was nothing there now.]
190: 2458| [45] [Yuuri was no longer with them.]
191: 2463| [45] [Natsuhiko finally accepted that truth--]
192: 2468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2469| [45] [(Goodbye, Yuuri...)]
194: 2474| [45] [--and bid her farewell.]
195: 2532| [45] [She no longer existed anywhere but in their memories.]
196: 2537| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled one such nostalgic memory.]
197: 2542| [45] [--A memory of when she was living--]
198: 2593| [55] [√Before Chapter 7]
199: 2639| [45] [--In the end, Natsuhiko couldn't fulfill his promise back then.]
200: 2644| [45] [He was the one who was always being protected.]
201: 2649| [45] [He was overwhelmed with regret, loss, and helplessness.]
202: 2654| [45] [But for that very reason-- there was something he needed to do.]
203: 2659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 2660| [45] [(... There's only one way I can atone.)]
205: 2665| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 2666| [45] [(By protecting the other girl who was always with me...!)]
207: 2671| [45] [He swore to protect her.]
208: 2676| [45] [His memories bestowed him with a sense of duty.]
209: 2681| [45] [With renewed gratitude towards Yuuri, Natsuhiko once again made a solemn oath.]
210: 2761| [47] [Mashiro]
211: 2762| [45] ["..."]
212: 2767| [45] [Mashiro silently grasped Natsuhiko's hand. He grasped back.]
213: 2927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2930| [45] ["Let's go, Mashiro!"]
215: 2938| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 2941| [45] ["... Yeah!"]
217: 2986| [45] [The two of them exchanged those words and left Area 5.]
218: 2991| [45] [To part with the past--]
219: 2996| [45] [--and head towards the future.]
