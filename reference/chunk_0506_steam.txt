  0:   60| [45] [--Three days ago--]
  1:   65| [45] [Jun had been visiting public institute after public institute for disaster prevention guidance purposes.]
  2:  180| [45] [One of those stops included Rokumei Academy-- where she was stopped by some students.]
  3:  188| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  191| [45] ["Aren't you...?"]
  5:  199| [47] [Jun]
  6:  202| [45] ["Hmm? Have we met somewhere?"]
  7:  228| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  231| [45] ["We were all at the scene of that accident! Remember?"]
  9:  239| [47] [Jun]
 10:  242| [45] ["Ah! You're the kids who reported that accident, aren't you?"]
 11:  304| [45] [--Those kids were "Natsuhiko", "Mashiro", and "Louise".]
 12:  327| [45] [They appeared to look up to Jun.]
 13:  350| [45] [Jun was also a bit happy about that, so when they asked her why she became a rescue worker to begin with, she answered honestly.]
 14:  362| [47] [Jun]
 15:  365| [45] ["I guess it's because I wanted to be a hero."]
 16:  391| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  394| [45] ["A hero?"]
 18:  402| [47] [Jun]
 19:  405| [45] ["Well, to be honest, ever since I was a kid, I've been something of a tomboy."]
 20:  413| [47] [Jun]
 21:  416| [45] ["I always wanted to be the 'hero' who saves people instead of the 'heroine' who needs to be saved."]
 22:  424| [47] [Jun]
 23:  427| [45] ["It's kinda tough to define what exactly a hero is, but saving people's lives is pretty damn heroic, I'd say."]
 24:  432| [45] [However, Jun was thinking something else then too.]
 25:  437| [47] [Jun]
 26:  438| [45] [(Well, I guess I do have another motive... Maybe it was also to get back at my old man.)]
 27:  486| [45] [Jun's father, a city council member, was still as arrogant now as he had been when Jun was a child.]
 28:  491| [45] [He was a total snob who still spat on the "justice" Jun believed in-- nothing like the heroes Jun admired.]
 29:  496| [45] [As a councilman of a city that had garnered much influence over the years, he had probably done several things that skirted on the edge of illegality.]
 30:  501| [45] [Jun had tried to gain his attention when she was a kid, but she more or less gave up by the time she entered middle school.]
 31:  506| [45] [In high school, she frequently left the house to hang out at Kazami's place instead, and once she graduated, she left home for good.]
 32:  511| [45] [Jun was currently living by herself in a small apartment she rented.]
 33:  559| [47] [Jun]
 34:  560| [45] [(Well, he lives his own way and I live mine. We're both adults now, after all.)]
 35:  565| [45] [Of course, whatever her father did had nothing to do with her.]
 36:  570| [45] [She figured she'd just live doing what she felt was right.]
 37:  619| [45] [Once she parted ways with Natsuhiko and his friends--]
 38:  672| [45] [Jun headed for her next destination: the PRC.]
 39:  720| [45] [She then took care of her disaster prevention guidance there and was about to head on back...]
 40:  727| [45] [When she spotted a familiar face in an office.]
 41:  733| [47] [Jun]
 42:  734| [45] [(Aw crap, Daddy!?)]
 43:  788| [45] [Jun frantically hid behind a door.]
 44:  793| [45] [She hadn't seen her father in the two years since she left home.]
 45:  798| [47] [Jun]
 46:  799| [45] [(What's Daddy doing at the PRC...?)]
 47:  804| [45] [It looked like her father was talking to the PRC's chief.]
 48:  889| [47] [PRC Chief]
 49:  892| [45] ["... There've been quite a lot of disasters lately... and I've got a feeling none of them were acts of God, if you know what I mean."]
 50:  897| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 51:  900| [45] ["So it really is -their- work, isn't it?"]
 52:  905| [47] [PRC Chief]
 53:  908| [45] ["I can't say for sure, but it's definitely possible."]
 54:  913| [47] [PRC Chief]
 55:  916| [45] ["But assuming it is, should we call those concerned to attention... to avoid a repeat of nine years ago?"]
 56:  921| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 57:  924| [45] ["Impossible. How would we explain it to them?"]
 58:  929| [47] [PRC Chief]
 59:  932| [45] ["... Perhaps we should disclose some information. It'd be a good opportunity, wouldn't it?"]
 60:  937| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 61:  940| [45] ["Disclose information? All that'd do is fuel the residents' anxiety."]
 62:  945| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 63:  948| [45] ["We mustn't acknowledge that members of Q have slipped their way into Rokumei City.%NNo matter what."]
 64:  953| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 65:  956| [45] ["It took us over ten years since that incident to finally achieve our current level of peace.%NThat'd all go down the drain if we were to reveal the truth now."]
 66:  961| [47] [Mr. Moribe]
 67:  964| [45] ["So we'll take care of this matter secretly. Got it?"]
 68:  969| [47] [PRC Chief]
 69:  970| [45] ["..."]
 70:  975| [45] [The chief grew quiet.]
 71:  980| [47] [Jun]
 72:  981| [45] [(... What're they talking about?)]
 73:  986| [45] [Nothing they said made any sense to her.]
 74:  991| [45] [There had always been a part of her father that had been shrouded in mystery for many years.]
 75:  996| [45] [After all, he was the man who'd ignored the citizen's protests and carried out the setup of cameras all over the city and strengthened the city gate regulations.]
 76: 1046| [47] [Jun]
 77: 1047| [45] [(Well... it's got nothing to do with me. I don't mind letting sleeping dogs lie.)]
 78: 1095| [45] [Jun left the building with that thought.]
