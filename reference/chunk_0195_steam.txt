  1:   84| [45] [When they looked to the sky, the rain had stopped before they had realized it.]
  2:  135| [45] [A nearly full moon shone brightly in the sky.]
  3:  140| [45] [Gazing upward at the moon, Mashiro whispered.]
  4:  148| [47] [Mashiro]
  5:  151| [45] ["Really, to think that things would turn out this way..."]
  6:  159| [47] [Salyu]
  7:  162| [45] ["I didn't expect it either. The security department basically seems like a police force.%NAnd they act quick."]
  8:  170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  173| [45] ["Yeah..."]
 10:  187| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Mashiro as he answered her. She looked somewhat depressed.]
 11:  192| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  193| [45] [(It's understandable... I mean, they did blockade her house and all.)]
 13:  198| [45] [In no time at all, they had lost two places of refuge.]
 14:  203| [45] [It was probably a huge shock that even her family got dragged into the mess.]
 15:  208| [45] [Mashiro was, after all, a girl. No matter how strong she was, there were times when she showed weakness.]
 16:  213| [45] [But as Natsuhiko pondered all of that, Mashiro just chuckled beside him.]
 17:  222| [45] [Around this time, he would've been taking a bath or talking with Yuuri about books.]
 18:  227| [45] [This wasn't exactly a change Natsuhiko had been hoping for.]
 19:  232| [45] [But for some reason-- this time Natsuhiko didn't feel all that bothered or bitter at all.]
 20:  237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  238| [45] [(Why's that...? What's gotten into me?)]
 22:  243| [45] [He couldn't understand why.]
 23:  248| [45] [Mashiro just chuckled beside him.]
 24:  256| [45] [They were enjoying their peace just earlier that evening, but that all collapsed when the public security department arrived.]
 25:  261| [45] [This wasn't exactly a change Natsuhiko had been hoping for.]
 26:  266| [45] [But there was no point in saying it.]
 27:  271| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  272| [45] [(In any case, I guess the fact that the rain has stopped is our one solace...)]
 29:  277| [45] [As Natsuhiko pondered all of that, Mashiro just chuckled beside him.]
 30:  359| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  362| [45] ["Kh... heheheh..."]
 32:  370| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  373| [45] ["H-hey, what's wrong, Mashiro?"]
 34:  442| [47] [Salyu]
 35:  445| [45] ["Is there something funny about the moon?"]
 36:  471| [47] [Mashiro]
 37:  474| [45] ["No, no, I just felt kind of nostalgic, that's all."]
 38:  482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  485| [45] ["Nostalgic...?"]
 40:  511| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  514| [45] ["Say, Natsuhiko, do you remember? Something like this happened in the past, right?"]
 42:  540| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  543| [45] ["Us getting chased around the city at night, I mean."]
 44:  551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  554| [45] ["Ah... you mean the 'Sirius Escape Plan'?"]
 46:  559| [45] [That reminded Natsuhiko.]
 47:  564| [45] [That did indeed happen.]
 48:  590| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  593| [45] ["... What's that?"]
 50:  601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  604| [45] ["Ah, it's just something that happened long ago."]
 52:  609| [45] [Natsuhiko recounted his memory of the past to Salyu.]
 53:  617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  620| [45] ["It was about ten years ago. We decided to keep a dog at this park. Just us kids."]
 55:  646| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  649| [45] ["A dog?"]
 57:  675| [47] [Mashiro]
 58:  678| [45] ["Yeah. He was a cute dog we named Sirius."]
 59:  704| [47] [Salyu]
 60:  707| [45] ["Cuter than Alice?"]
 61:  765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  768| [45] ["Hmm? Well... probably about the same, I guess."]
 63:  773| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly before continuing.]
 64:  781| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  784| [45] ["To us, Sirius was our dog, but to the world, he was a stray."]
 66:  792| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  795| [45] ["So one day, the healthcare center conducted a stray dog hunt and we were worried he would get caught up in it."]
 68:  821| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  824| [45] ["S-so, what happened?"]
 70:  839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  842| [45] ["Well, Mashiro and I talked about what to do with poor Sirius..."]
 72:  850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  853| [45] ["And we hatched a plan to save him."]
 74:  879| [47] [Salyu]
 75:  882| [45] ["A plan?"]
 76:  887| [45] [As she asked that question, Natsuhiko's heart relived the memory of that night.]
 77:  998| [55] [√Before Chapter 5]
 78: 1091| [45] [--As he recalled that event, Natsuhiko realized.]
 79: 1096| [45] [What Mashiro had said last night was what he had once said himself.]
 80: 1101| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1102| [45] [(... "Protect what you hold dear with your own hands", huh.)]
 82: 1107| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1108| [45] [(When Mashiro said that yesterday, she was referencing what happened back then, huh...)]
 84: 1113| [45] [As Natsuhiko made that realization, Mashiro spoke.]
 85: 1139| [47] [Mashiro]
 86: 1142| [45] ["Yeah, it was on a night with a full moon just like this, huh..."]
 87: 1168| [47] [Mashiro]
 88: 1171| [45] ["We slipped out of our houses at night."]
 89: 1197| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1200| [45] ["Natsuhiko and I made an escape route for Sirius to get outside the city."]
 91: 1226| [47] [Salyu]
 92: 1229| [45] ["What happened to Sirius after that? Was he able to escape?"]
 93: 1237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1240| [45] ["After a little while, we got a phone call from someone living in the next city."]
 95: 1248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1251| [45] ["It was a nice lady who said she was keeping Sirius at her house."]
 97: 1262| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1265| [45] ["Well, Mashiro and I talked about what to do with poor Sirius--"]
 99: 1291| [47] [Mashiro]
100: 1294| [45] ["We slipped out of our houses at night and made an escape route for Sirius to get outside the city."]
101: 1302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1305| [45] ["Yeah, it was on a night with a full moon just like this, huh..."]
103: 1310| [45] [After hearing the story, Salyu spoke up honestly.]
104: 1336| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1339| [45] ["Remarkable. You two saved a life."]
106: 1365| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1368| [45] ["I know, right~?"]
108: 1373| [45] [Mashiro smiled triumphantly. Natsuhiko looked back fondly on that moment as well.]
109: 1381| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1384| [45] ["... But all the adults probably got mad at us afterwards. We ran away since we didn't want to get yelled at."]
111: 1410| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 1413| [45] ["We ran all around town at night, huh. So tonight's kind of like what happened then."]
113: 1418| [45] [After hearing the story, Salyu looked up to the moon and whispered.]
114: 1444| [47] [Salyu]
115: 1447| [45] ["That sounds like a very good memory..."]
116: 1455| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1458| [45] ["... Yeah, I think so too."]
118: 1463| [45] [Natsuhiko worked earnestly back then for the righteous cause of saving Sirius.]
119: 1468| [45] [He didn't stop to think too hard about the details. He just tackled the danger with reckless abandon. And he succeeded.]
120: 1473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1474| [45] [(So I'll just do that again this time--)]
122: 1479| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko spoke to Mashiro who was sitting beside him.]
123: 1487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1490| [45] ["Hey, Mashiro..."]
125: 1516| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 1519| [45] ["Huh?"]
127: 1527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1530| [45] ["Today was tough, huh? The security department's tracking us down, and so we can't even go home."]
129: 1556| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 1559| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
131: 1567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1570| [45] ["But now that things have escalated this far--"]
133: 1578| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1581| [45] ["We need the resolve to not go home until we've put an end to this, okay?"]
135: 1586| [45] [Mashiro's eyes widened at those words.]
136: 1612| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 1615| [45] ["... An end to this? You mean--"]
138: 1623| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1626| [45] ["Until we prevent the terrorist plot ourselves."]
140: 1634| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1637| [45] ["I don't know what exactly we can do, but it's better to try than to do nothing."]
142: 1716| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 1719| [45] ["... Natsuhiko!"]
144: 1724| [45] [Mashiro's eyes sparkled as she took Natsuhiko by the hand.]
145: 1750| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 1753| [45] ["It took you long enough, but now you've got the spirit! I'm so happy!"]
147: 1761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 1764| [45] ["Ah, well, I'm just saying there's a matter of resolve... Since you're girls, I'm just thinking you'd need a change of clothes or a bath or something."]
149: 1809| [47] [Mashiro]
150: 1812| [45] ["No, no, considering the situation, that's no matter at all!"]
151: 1817| [45] [Mashiro jumped for joy.]
152: 1822| [45] [But Salyu on the other hand just had a critical look on her face.]
153: 1891| [47] [Salyu]
154: 1894| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, I thought I told you I don't recommend putting yourself in danger."]
155: 1902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1905| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Salyu."]
157: 1928| [47] [Salyu]
158: 1929| [45] ["..."]
159: 1934| [45] [Salyu glared at Natsuhiko for a while before eventually muttering in resignation.]
160: 1960| [47] [Salyu]
161: 1963| [45] ["... Looks like I have no other choice. I will help you two to the best of my ability."]
162: 1989| [47] [Mashiro]
163: 1992| [45] ["Huh, you too, Salyu!?"]
164: 2018| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 2021| [45] ["Okay, if all three of us give it our best, then there's nothing to be scared of!"]
166: 2026| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Mashiro and shrugged.]
167: 2031| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2032| [45] [(Nothing to be scared of? Honestly...?)]
169: 2037| [45] [Even if the three of them did run into terrorists, the terrorists seemed more likely to overpower them than anything.]
170: 2042| [45] [But that's exactly why the three of them had to pull themselves together if they wanted to accomplish anything.]
171: 2050| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2053| [45] ["... Well, now that that's settled, what should we do next?"]
173: 2079| [47] [Mashiro]
174: 2082| [45] ["Good question. It is getting kinda late..."]
175: 2154| [47] [Salyu]
176: 2157| [45] ["First, we need to secure a place we can stay the night."]
177: 2162| [45] [Salyu spoke as she disconnected Alice from the surveillance camera.]
178: 2167| [45] [She put away the cable and display into Alice's back, returning her to a more stuffed animal shape as she continued.]
179: 2193| [47] [Salyu]
180: 2196| [45] ["It could start raining again. That would be a nuisance."]
181: 2204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 2207| [45] ["That's true. So for now, let's head into the city."]
183: 2241| [47] [Mashiro]
184: 2244| [45] ["We need to be careful not to get caught by the bad guys..."]
185: 2252| [45] [Natsuhiko led the two girls.]
186: 2414| [45] [--And later they ended up in the heart of the city.]
187: 2419| [45] [They somehow made it while taking meticulous care not to be caught by the security department or the surveillance cameras.]
188: 2445| [47] [Salyu]
189: 2448| [45] ["Where can we stay the night...?"]
190: 2456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2459| [45] ["How about a manga cafe or something?"]
192: 2485| [47] [Mashiro]
193: 2488| [45] ["Where would we find a manga cafe at this hour? They're heavily regulated."]
194: 2496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 2499| [45] ["Hmm, but we don't have much money..."]
196: 2525| [47] [Mashiro]
197: 2528| [45] ["Ah! Natsuhiko, how about that!?"]
198: 2533| [45] [Natsuhiko traced Mashiro's glance--]
199: 2541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2544| [45] ["A karaoke box, huh..."]
201: 2549| [45] [She was looking at a karaoke box that primarily served Rokumei Academy students.]
202: 2554| [45] [The reception desk was so lenient that they allowed students to go there at night, no questions asked.]
203: 2559| [45] [There was a surveillance camera at the entrance, but there were so many dead spots that it seemed easy enough to enter without being caught on film.]
204: 2564| [45] [And of course, there were no surveillance cameras inside which made it a calming place for the students to let loose from the stress of living in such an uptight town.]
205: 2590| [47] [Mashiro]
206: 2593| [45] ["Looks like they're open 24 hours. Perfect, right?"]
207: 2601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2604| [45] ["Then let's hurry up and get in. There's no point if we linger long enough for them to spot our entrance."]
209: 2609| [45] [As Natsuhiko started walking up to the door, Salyu tugged on his sleeve.]
210: 2635| [47] [Salyu]
211: 2638| [45] ["Hold on... What's a karaoke box?"]
212: 2646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 2649| [45] ["Huh?"]
214: 2675| [47] [Mashiro]
215: 2678| [45] ["Huh!? Salyu, you don't know what a karaoke box is!?"]
216: 2704| [47] [Salyu]
217: 2707| [45] ["Never heard of them. What kind of facility is it?"]
218: 2715| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 2718| [45] ["Well, I guess it's a 'facility' for singing songs."]
220: 2744| [47] [Salyu]
221: 2747| [45] ["Songs...?"]
222: 2752| [45] [Salyu stared blankly.]
223: 2757| [45] [Natsuhiko heard there were karaoke boxes in France, but Salyu appeared to have no knowledge of them at all.]
224: 2765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 2768| [45] ["Well, I guess this is as good a learning opportunity as ever."]
226: 2773| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro took Salyu into the store.]
