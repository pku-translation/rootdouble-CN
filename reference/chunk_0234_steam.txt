  0:   50| [55] [√Before Chapter 4]
  1:   71| [45] [--In reality, Natsuhiko was standing in front of a collapsed emergency staircase.]
  2:  145| [45] [Beside him were an anxious Mashiro and a frightened Yuuri.]
  3:  150| [45] [They had gotten separated from Salyu and were searching for an escape route.]
  4:  155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  156| [45] [(...!)]
  6:  161| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart filled with regret.]
  7:  166| [45] [The regret of leaving Salyu in the den of the enemy.]
  8:  171| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  172| [45] [(Dammit... I can't do it! I really can't leave Salyu all by herself!)]
 10:  177| [45] [And with that resolution, Natsuhiko spoke to Yuuri and Mashiro.]
 11:  185| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  188| [45] ["Y-you two... just wait right here for a second!"]
 13:  214| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  217| [45] ["Huh? Wh-why!?"]
 15:  225| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  228| [45] ["I'm going back to Salyu for a bit to back her up!"]
 17:  254| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  257| [45] ["W... wait a second, Hikorin! That's not what it is you need to do, remember!?"]
 19:  262| [45] [Yuuri flared up at Natsuhiko's words.]
 20:  288| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  291| [45] ["What did that girl say to you?"]
 22:  317| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  320| [45] ["She said that your duty is to make sure Mashiron escapes, didn't she!?"]
 24:  325| [45] [Yuuri rarely ever yelled like that.]
 25:  351| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  354| [45] ["Besides, she said we'd just be a hindrance to her, didn't she!?"]
 27:  362| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  365| [45] ["We need to follow what Salyu said and search for an exit route!"]
 29:  370| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head at Mashiro's words.]
 30:  378| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  381| [45] ["I know what Salyu said, but... I'm still worried about her."]
 32:  407| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  410| [45] ["B-but..."]
 34:  418| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  421| [45] ["I'm sorry, but please, stay here! I'll be back right away!"]
 36:  426| [45] [Natsuhiko ran off at that.]
 37:  452| [47] [Yuuri]
 38:  455| [45] ["Hikorin!? Hold on, Hikorin!"]
 39:  509| [45] [Natsuhiko paid no heed as Yuuri tried to stop him--]
 40:  558| [45] [--and he traced back his steps.]
 41:  563| [45] [Back to where they had split up with Salyu.]
 42:  613| [45] [But when he got there--]
 43:  621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  624| [45] ["H-huh?"]
 45:  654| [45] [The place was already empty.]
 46:  662| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  665| [45] ["Where did Salyu... where did the enemy go!?"]
 48:  680| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around.]
 49:  685| [45] [But there was no one in sight.]
 50:  690| [45] [Instead...]
 51:  700| [45] [He saw something strange fallen over at the edge of the hallway.]
 52:  708| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  711| [45] ["Hmm...?"]
 54:  716| [45] [A strange cylindrical object with some sort of digital clock attached.]
 55:  861| [45] [The numbers on the clock counted down from 5, 4, 3...]
 56:  867| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  868| [45] [(Wait, don't tell me that's--)]
 58:  876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  879| [45] ["A time bomb!?"]
 60:  884| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko yelled that word,]
 61:  980| [45] [a flash of light shined before his eyes.]
 62:  988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  991| [45] ["!!!"]
 64: 1044| [45] [Natsuhiko was blown away by an intense shockwave.]
 65: 1071| [45] [His body flew through the air and slammed into a wall.]
 66: 1087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1090| [45] ["Gah!"]
 68: 1111| [45] [He tumbled to the floor and eventually stopped.]
 69: 1166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1169| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
 71: 1174| [45] [He seemed to have hit his head hard.]
 72: 1179| [45] [His consciousness clouded over.]
 73: 1184| [45] [His clothes were burning, perhaps due to the blast.]
 74: 1189| [45] [But even when he tried to put out the flames, his body wouldn't move.]
 75: 1194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1195| [45] [(I-Is this... the end for me...?)]
 77: 1200| [45] [He looked down at his body to check his injuries.]
 78: 1205| [45] [His arm was soaked in blood. Even his broken watch was dyed red.]
 79: 1210| [45] [Although the watch hands were thoroughly crushed, he could still clearly make out the date indicator.]
 80: 1255| [45] ["9/13"-- Somehow he doubted that date.]
 81: 1260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1261| [45] [(... Huh... Was today September 13th...?)]
 83: 1266| [45] [Something felt off, but his head was too numb for him to think properly.]
 84: 1277| [45] [And then he heard a voice off somewhere in the distance.]
 85: 1303| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1306| [45] ["H... Hikorin!!"]
 87: 1311| [45] [It was Yuuri's voice.]
 88: 1316| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1317| [45] [(D-did she come looking for me...?)]
 90: 1322| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to lift his face.]
 91: 1327| [45] [But he couldn't even do that.]
 92: 1332| [45] [All he could do was listen to Yuuri's hurried footsteps.]
 93: 1337| [45] [Her sorrowful voice rang out in his ears.]
 94: 1345| [47] [Yuuri]
 95: 1348| [45] ["I'm sorry...! I'm so sorry, Hikorin...!"]
 96: 1353| [45] [Yuuri seemed to be crying.]
 97: 1358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1359| [45] [(What does she have to apologize for...?)]
 99: 1364| [45] [Yuuri answered Natsuhiko's doubts.]
100: 1372| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1375| [45] ["It's my fault for putting you through this...!"]
102: 1380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1381| [45] [(Huh...? It's not your fault, is it, Yuuri...?)]
104: 1386| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1387| [45] [(I just ran off on my own, that's all...)]
106: 1413| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1416| [45] ["But it's my fault..."]
108: 1421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1422| [45] [(...?)]
110: 1430| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 1433| [45] ["There was something I wanted you to understand, no matter what..."]
112: 1441| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 1444| [45] ["Or else... something even worse will definitely happen to you, Hikorin...!"]
114: 1449| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't understand what Yuuri was saying at all.]
115: 1454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1455| [45] [(... Something you wanted me to understand? What...?)]
117: 1463| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1466| [45] ["That your duty... is to 'protect Mashiron'."]
119: 1474| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1477| [45] ["That's for you own good too, Hikorin-- ..."]
121: 1498| [45] [That's all he heard before Yuuri's voice faded into the distance.]
122: 1504| [45] [... And he could hear nothing else after that.]
123: 1509| [45] [In the silent world, all he could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat.]
124: 1514| [45] [And even that soon faded away--]
125: 1519| [45] [His only companion was utter silence.]

131: 1600| [45] [--Eventually, in the deep depths of his fading consciousness--]
132: 1605| [45] ["Awake", a voice called to him.]
133: 1610| [45] [Or perhaps it was merely a memory of such a voice.]
134: 1615| [45] [The moment he heard that voice...]
135: 1620| [45] [Time returned to that day once more.]
