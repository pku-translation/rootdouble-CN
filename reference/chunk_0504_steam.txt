  0:   61| [45] [--It happened one day about three years ago.]
  1:   66| [45] [Jun had started to notice something off about Kazami's behavior.]
  2:  151| [45] [--She and Kazami had gone shopping that day.]
  3:  156| [45] [But for some reason, Kazami acted like her mind was galaxies away.]
  4:  164| [47] [Jun]
  5:  167| [45] ["Hey Sis, what should we eat for lunch?"]
  6:  193| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  196| [45] ["Good question... What would be nice?"]
  8:  201| [45] [Calling out to her only resulted in receiving half-hearted replies like that one.]
  9:  206| [45] [Jun raised her voice in frustration.]
 10:  214| [47] [Jun]
 11:  217| [45] ["Sheesh! What's gotten into you, Sis!?"]
 12:  278| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  281| [45] ["Huh?"]
 14:  289| [47] [Jun]
 15:  292| [45] ["Did I do something to piss you off or something? If you got something you wanna say, then let it out."]
 16:  318| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  321| [45] ["Ah, no... you didn't make me angry, it's just..."]
 18:  326| [45] [After she finished mumbling nervously, Kazami quietly continued.]
 19:  352| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  355| [45] ["... Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you..."]
 21:  363| [47] [Jun]
 22:  366| [45] ["Huh? What's up?"]
 23:  392| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  395| [45] ["... Jun, have you..."]
 25:  403| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  406| [45] ["Ever gone out with a guy before?"]
 27:  429| [47] [Jun]
 28:  432| [45] ["Huh!? Wh-where'd this come from!?"]
 29:  458| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  461| [45] ["Ah, um... well, as your substitute older sister, I just felt it might be better for me to know these kinds of things, that's all..."]
 31:  469| [47] [Jun]
 32:  472| [45] ["No, I haven't..."]
 33:  480| [47] [Jun]
 34:  483| [45] ["B-but, it's not like I'm unpopular or anything, you hear?"]
 35:  491| [47] [Jun]
 36:  494| [45] ["I've gotten love letters and confessions and stuff before..."]
 37:  520| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  523| [45] ["I see..."]
 39:  528| [45] [Kazami sighed.]
 40:  533| [47] [Jun]
 41:  534| [45] [(Wh... what's up with her?)]
 42:  539| [45] [Jun had thought that pigs would fly before Kazami would ever bring up the topic of love.]
 43:  544| [45] [Just when Jun wondered if she should start checking the skies to be safe, Kazami asked another question.]
 44:  570| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  573| [45] ["Then let me ask a different question... Do you... know much about classical music?"]
 46:  581| [47] [Jun]
 47:  584| [45] ["Huh? Classical music?"]
 48:  610| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  613| [45] ["If you do, then I'd like you to tell me as much as you know..."]
 50:  621| [47] [Jun]
 51:  624| [45] ["Sorry, my brain's a total blank on the subject. All I listen to is rock."]
 52:  650| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  653| [45] ["... I see..."]
 54:  658| [45] [Kazami let out another deep sigh.]
 55:  663| [45] [Jun had started doing a lot of things to rebel against her father around the time she entered middle school.]
 56:  668| [45] [Said father was a classical music aficionado.]
 57:  674| [45] [Under the belief that "he who hates Peter harms his dogs", Jun had grown to associate classical music with her father, and thus hated it, turning to rock instead in rebellion.]
 58:  679| [47] [Jun]
 59:  680| [45] [(But why's Sis bringing up love and classical music like that? She hasn't shown interest in either topic up until--)]
 60:  685| [45] [It was then that the pieces clicked in Jun's head and she gasped.]
 61:  693| [47] [Jun]
 62:  696| [45] ["Oh my God! Don't tell me you finally found a guy you like!?"]
 63:  757| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  760| [45] ["Huh!? Wh-what makes you think that!?"]
 65:  768| [47] [Jun]
 66:  771| [45] ["Well, it just sounds like you've got the hots for some guy who likes classical music, so you're trying to get into it too just so you can hold a conversation with him or something."]
 67:  832| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  835| [45] ["N-no! That's not it at all..."]
 69:  861| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  864| [45] ["Um, well, you see... right, I heard it has relaxing effects!"]
 71:  872| [47] [Jun]
 72:  875| [45] ["Relaxing effects?"]
 73:  901| [47] [Kazami]
 74:  904| [45] ["Yes, they say that listening to classical music works wonders at putting a tired mind to ease, right?"]
 75:  930| [47] [Kazami]
 76:  933| [45] ["I've been working with so much pent-up stress lately that I thought listening to classical music might be the remedy I need..."]
 77:  941| [47] [Jun]
 78:  944| [45] ["Oh really...?"]
 79:  949| [45] [It sounded like she was lying, but Jun decided not to press her on it for now.]
 80:  954| [45] [In exchange, she gave Kazami a warning instead.]
 81:  962| [47] [Jun]
 82:  965| [45] ["But let me just give you a little heads up, Sis--"]
 83:  973| [47] [Jun]
 84:  976| [45] ["All guys who like classical music are scumbags."]
 85: 1037| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1040| [45] ["Wh-what!?"]
 87: 1048| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1051| [45] ["Well, I mean, my father likes it. And I've think I've already told you what a scumbag he is."]
 89: 1077| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1080| [45] ["B-but that just sounds more like you're being too biased, if you ask me..."]
 91: 1088| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1091| [45] ["Nope, a person's taste in music shows their true colors."]
 93: 1099| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1102| [45] ["You've gotta keep that in mind when you're picking out a guy, you get me?"]
 95: 1128| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1131| [45] ["A... all right."]
 97: 1136| [45] [Jun secretly thought to herself once she saw Kazami's meek reply.]
 98: 1141| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1142| [45] [(Good... this should keep Sis away from any sickos. God be damned if that day ever came...)]
100: 1147| [45] [Jun would feel a little lonely if Kazami ever got a boyfriend, but it would ultimately be a cause for celebration.]
101: 1152| [45] [But that man would have to meet Jun's highest standards before she ever accepted him.]
102: 1157| [47] [Jun]
103: 1158| [45] [(... I made up my mind to protect Sis in Nagisa's place.)]
104: 1163| [47] [Jun]
105: 1164| [45] [(That includes keeping her safe from any bastard who doesn't give her everything she deserves.)]
106: 1169| [45] [Jun secretly renewed her determination to maintain that policy.]
