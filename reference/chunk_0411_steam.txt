  1:   53| [45] [--Eventually, his voice echoes through the darkness.]
  2:   61| [47] [Watase]
  3:   64| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, is everything okay?"]
  4:  142| [45] [I open my eyes at the sound of his voice.]
  5:  147| [45] [My five senses return from their connection to Yuuri, and I see Watase with my own eyes.]
  6:  155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  158| [45] ["... I'm okay. I only hurt her mind a little."]
  8:  166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  169| [45] ["I damaged her memories just a little bit."]
 10:  177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  180| [45] ["Even though I never wanted to use this ability for my own conveniences ever again..."]
 12:  206| [47] [Watase]
 13:  209| [45] ["... I see."]
 14:  214| [45] [Yuuri's lying down by his feet.]
 15:  219| [45] [It seems Watase had caught her and laid her down on the ground after she had fainted from the shock of memory erasure.]
 16:  245| [47] [Watase]
 17:  248| [45] ["I'm real sorry, Natsuhiko. This really isn't what you wanted at all, is it?"]
 18:  256| [47] [Watase]
 19:  259| [45] ["I know you didn't want to come with me either..."]
 20:  264| [45] [I answer that question after a moment of silence.]
 21:  272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  275| [45] ["No... I wouldn't say that's entirely the case."]
 23:  301| [47] [Watase]
 24:  304| [45] ["What?"]
 25:  312| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  315| [45] ["Now that we've come this far, I finally understand how you and Mr. Ukita feel."]
 27:  323| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  326| [45] ["If someone's been trampling people from behind the shadows... and will continue to do so until they're stopped..."]
 29:  334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  337| [45] ["Then I want to right that wrong even if it means staining my hands with crime."]
 31:  345| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  348| [45] ["You think so too, don't you, Watase?"]
 33:  374| [47] [Watase]
 34:  377| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 35:  385| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  388| [45] ["To be honest, I don't really understand what sort of organization Q is. They might actually be an evil terrorist organization whose crimes spread beyond Rokumei City."]
 37:  396| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  399| [45] ["So I won't let my guard down around Q. I'm going with you, but solely to fulfill the role I that I have to."]
 39:  425| [47] [Watase]
 40:  428| [45] ["Of course, Natsuhiko. I won't make you a terrorist or anything. I won't expose you to any danger."]
 41:  436| [47] [Watase]
 42:  439| [45] ["Since I'm the one asking for your cooperation, that's my responsibility. I'll protect you with all my strength."]
 43:  447| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  450| [45] ["... I guess your strong sense of duty never fades, huh. Fine, guess I'll take you up on that offer then."]
 45:  476| [47] [Watase]
 46:  479| [45] ["And that sharp tongue of yours never fades either. Well, I don't blame you."]
 47:  484| [45] [There are things that Watase and I cannot do alone.]
 48:  489| [45] [There are things that Watase and I must do together.]
 49:  512| [45] [Now that we share a joint role, a smile forms upon our lips.]
 50:  520| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  523| [45] ["... Well, guess we should get going, then. Mashiro and the others will catch up to us if we're too slow."]
 52:  549| [47] [Watase]
 53:  552| [45] ["Yeah. I'm sorry, but let's leave Yuuri to Teach and the others."]
 54:  560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  563| [45] ["What do we do from here?"]
 56:  589| [47] [Watase]
 57:  592| [45] ["Once we slip out of this forest, some Q members are supposed to come pick us up in a car."]
 58:  600| [47] [Watase]
 59:  603| [45] ["They've apparently made preparations to slip past the city gate. So for now, let's follow their instructions and break out of the city."]
 60:  611| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  614| [45] ["Okay. Lead the way."]
 62:  669| [45] [Watase and I start walking off after I say that.]
 63:  816| [45] [He supports me as we walk through the dark forest.]
 64:  821| [45] [The stars shining in the night sky faintly illuminate our path.]
 65:  826| [45] [Eventually, I speak up.]
 66:  834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  837| [45] ["... Hey, Watase. It might be weird of me to say this, but..."]
 68:  845| [47] [Watase]
 69:  848| [45] ["What?"]
 70:  856| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  859| [45] ["I think we've finally come to understand each other... It makes me just a little happy."]
 72:  867| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  870| [45] ["When we work together, it feels like we can take on anything."]
 74:  878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  881| [45] ["That no matter who our enemy may be, we can stick firm to our beliefs."]
 76:  954| [47] [Watase]
 77:  957| [45] ["... You're right."]
 78:  965| [47] [Watase]
 79:  968| [45] ["That's why we chose to take this route."]
 80:  973| [45] [Watase looks at me and answers softly.]
 81:  981| [47] [Watase]
 82:  984| [45] ["... The real war starts here. I'm sure it'll be harsh and severe, but..."]
 83:  992| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84:  995| [45] ["I know. But even so, let's pass judgment on the true evil so that one day we may bring the entire truth to light."]
 85: 1042| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1045| [45] ["Yeah... and I promise..."]
 87: 1053| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1056| [45] ["Once everything's over, I'll get you back to Yuuri for sure."]
 89: 1064| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1067| [45] ["Yeah. I'm counting on you, 'partner'."]
 91: 1072| [45] [Watase nods firmly at those words.]
 92: 1123| [85] [　%N　%N]
 93: 1128| [45] [--Watase and I keep on walking.]
 94: 1132| [85] [　]
 95: 1137| [45] [To protect those precious to us.%NAnd to avenge all the people whose lives have been trampled on.]
 96: 1141| [85] [　]
 97: 1146| [45] [None of this is over yet.%NWe won't stop walking until the day peace is restored.]
 98: 1150| [85] [　]
 99: 1155| [45] [I feel a blazing fire in my heart silently stir to life.]
