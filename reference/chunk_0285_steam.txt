  1:   58| [45] [----]
  2:   63| [45] [--]
  3:   74| [45] [--Yuuri was woken up by a strange sound and an extreme heat.]
  4:  157| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  160| [45] ["Mm, mmm..."]
  6:  168| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  171| [45] ["H... Hikorin..."]
  8:  176| [45] [For a moment, she remembered the time she was locked away in LABO with Natsuhiko, so she unthinkingly called out his name.]
  9:  181| [45] [But she was mistaken. It was currently September 16, 2030, nine years after that memory.]
 10:  186| [45] [Yuuri looked around. She didn't see the man, but--]
 11:  209| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  212| [45] ["Ah...!"]
 13:  217| [45] [The hallway was engulfed in flames.]
 14:  222| [45] [The fires had probably spread while she was unconscious.]
 15:  230| [47] [Yuuri]
 16:  233| [45] ["I... I gotta get away...!"]
 17:  244| [45] [Yuuri stood up in confusion and ran away from the flames.]
 18:  249| [45] [As she ran, Yuuri thought to herself.]
 19:  254| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  255| [45] [(How long have I been unconscious?)]
 21:  260| [47] [Yuuri]
 22:  261| [45] [(Where did that man go!?)]
 23:  266| [45] [The man had disappeared after knocking Yuuri out.]
 24:  271| [45] [From that observation, she couldn't understand what his goal was at all.]
 25:  276| [47] [Yuuri]
 26:  277| [45] [(No, there's no time to think about all of that! First, I need to find a way to survive!)]
 27:  326| [45] [Yuuri shook off her doubts and ran through the hallway.]
 28:  375| [45] [On the way, she stopped by a room and obtained a Lv. 6 security card that had been left behind.]
 29:  429| [45] [She tried going to Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa's office, but saw no sign of Natsuhiko and the others.]
 30:  434| [45] [They probably escaped by their own means.]
 31:  439| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  440| [45] [(Thank goodness...)]
 33:  468| [45] [Right when Yuuri sighed in relief, the flames assailed her.]
 34:  476| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  479| [45] ["Kyah!"]
 36:  484| [45] [Yuuri kept running as the fire and smoke chased her.]
 37:  542| [45] [She went through the blazing factory--]
 38:  620| [45] [And then into Area 1.]
 39:  625| [45] [But there were no escape routes to be found.]
 40:  641| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  644| [45] ["Ah, ah, ah...!"]
 42:  650| [45] [There was no longer any way out.]
 43:  655| [45] [Every path she took was blocked by fire.]
 44:  663| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  666| [45] ["That room..."]
 46:  671| [45] [Yuuri plunged into a nearby room, every fiber of her being focused only on escaping from the flames.]
 47:  757| [45] [She lowered her body and crawled under a desk so as to not breathe in the smoke.]
 48:  762| [45] [But she could tell it was only a matter of time before that room burned up too.]
 49:  767| [47] [Yuuri]
 50:  768| [45] [(Ah... Am I going to die here...?)]
 51:  815| [45] [She thought that might not be such a bad thing.]
 52:  820| [45] [Even if she were to survive, she probably would still never make it out of LABO.]
 53:  825| [45] [As long as Natsuhiko and the others managed to escape in the end, that was probably good enough for her.]
 54:  830| [47] [Yuuri]
 55:  831| [45] [(That's right... the lie we kept telling is now coming true. That's all.)]
 56:  836| [45] [And with that thought, Yuuri prepared herself, but then--]
 57: 1015| [45] [She heard an explosion from outside the room.]
 58: 1023| [47] [Yuuri]
 59: 1026| [45] ["Kyaahh!!"]
 60: 1039| [45] [Yuuri couldn't help but scream.]
 61: 1044| [45] [The door to the room was crushed and flames rushed in.]
 62: 1049| [45] [And then, the force of the flames fiercely intensified. Perhaps something explosive had caught on fire.]
 63: 1065| [47] [Yuuri]
 64: 1068| [45] ["A-aah..."]
 65: 1079| [45] [The heat was so intense that it was difficult to breathe.]
 66: 1084| [45] [A heat haze rose from the entire floor, warping the sight of Yuuri's surroundings.]
 67: 1089| [45] [As she watched the haze, all of the preparation Yuuri had made to accept her death--]
 68: 1094| [45] [--turned into fear.]
 69: 1110| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1113| [45] ["N-no..."]
 71: 1121| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1124| [45] ["No, no, no... I don't want to die... I don't want to die...!"]
 73: 1129| [45] [She kept screaming in solitude.]
 74: 1134| [45] [The fear of actual impending death blew away what little resolve to die Yuuri thought she had.]
 75: 1139| [45] [A heat wave blew through like a windstorm.]
 76: 1144| [45] [Smoke filled the room.]
 77: 1167| [47] [Yuuri]
 78: 1170| [45] ["*cough*! *cough*!"]
 79: 1175| [45] [Yuuri coughed violently. Her eyes watered.]
 80: 1180| [45] [But then-- she heard voices from somewhere in the distance.]
 81: 1200| [47] [???]
 82: 1203| [45] ["Get a hose ready!"]
 83: 1211| [47] [???]
 84: 1214| [45] ["Roger!"]
 85: 1234| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1235| [45] [(!?)]
 87: 1240| [45] [They were female voices.]
 88: 1248| [47] [???]
 89: 1251| [45] ["Whoa-- outta the way, Captain!"]
 90: 1259| [47] [???]
 91: 1262| [45] ["Commence water release!"]
 92: 1270| [47] [???]
 93: 1273| [45] ["Roger! Here it comes!!"]
 94: 1278| [45] [Judging by their conversation, they seemed to be firefighters or something.]
 95: 1283| [45] [When Yuuri lifted her head, she heard the sound of water coming from the other side of the crushed door.]
 96: 1294| [45] [They were extinguishing the fires outside.]
 97: 1299| [45] [The violent heat wave rapidly died down.]
 98: 1304| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1305| [45] [(Th-there's no doubt about it... They're firefighters!)]
100: 1313| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1316| [45] ["S-someone..."]
102: 1324| [47] [Yuuri]
103: 1327| [45] ["He... help me...!"]
104: 1332| [45] [She heard a voice in response.]
105: 1340| [47] [???]
106: 1343| [45] ["Someone's... in that room!?"]
107: 1348| [45] [Yuuri called out once more to whomever it was that was rushing over to her.]
108: 1356| [47] [Yuuri]
109: 1359| [45] ["Someone... help... me..."]
110: 1364| [45] [And finally, the owner of the footsteps came running into the room.]
111: 1398| [47] [???]
112: 1401| [45] ["Are you okay!?"]
113: 1406| [45] [Yuuri desperately reached out her hand.]
114: 1411| [45] [But as soon as she made eye contact with the owner of the voice--]
115: 1440| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1443| [45] ["--!?"]
117: 1448| [45] [Yuuri gasped in shock.]
118: 1537| [45] [Standing there was the man who had just attacked her earlier.]
119: 1542| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1543| [45] [(Why!? Why did he come to save me!?)]
121: 1548| [45] [She was thoroughly confused and understood nothing of the situation.]
122: 1586| [45] [The man's face stiffened too for some reason, and he froze in place.]
123: 1591| [45] [Meanwhile, the fires drew closer to Yuuri.]
124: 1596| [45] [Eventually the man shot off like a bullet--]
125: 1628| [45] [--straight into the room to save Yuuri.]
