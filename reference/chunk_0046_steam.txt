  1:   50| [47] [Watase]
  2:   53| [45] ["Okay, looks good to go. Get on my back and I'll climb us up to the top."]
  3:   92| [47] [Ena]
  4:   95| [45] ["Wait, can you pull that off? I mean, I'm heavy in my own way, you know."]
  5:  103| [47] [Watase]
  6:  106| [45] ["Oh come on, you're as light as a feather. And we're only climbing 4 or 5 meters up."]
  7:  114| [47] [Watase]
  8:  117| [45] ["So come on, hurry up and get on my back."]
  9:  122| [45] [Oddly enough, he was totally confident that he'd have no problems climbing even with Ena on his back.]
 10:  142| [45] [Perhaps that confidence had come through to her, as after a moment's hesitation, Ena wrapped her arms around Watase's shoulders.]
 11:  150| [47] [Watase]
 12:  153| [45] ["Okay, here we go. Hang on tight."]
 13:  161| [47] [Ena]
 14:  164| [45] ["R-right."]
 15:  169| [45] [Watase began climbing the rope with her voice as the trigger.]
 16:  238| [45] [It was probably an action that'd been drilled into him in training.]
 17:  243| [45] [Watase got up to the top with little to no effort, even with the weight of two.]
 18:  256| [47] [Ena]
 19:  259| [45] ["Th-that was amazing...!"]
 20:  267| [47] [Watase]
 21:  270| [45] ["Guess it's a basic skill for rescue workers. I mean, it didn't even feel dangerous at all."]
 22:  278| [47] [Ena]
 23:  281| [45] ["Hmm... looks like you really are becoming more and more like a rescue worker with time."]
 24:  289| [47] [Watase]
 25:  292| [45] ["What do you mean 'like'? I actually am one, remember?"]
 26:  337| [45] [Ena giggled at Watase's complaints.]
 27:  342| [45] [Her body shook to the beat of her laughter--]
 28:  347| [45] [And it was only then that Watase noticed the two sensations pressing against his back.]
 29:  352| [47] [Watase]
 30:  353| [45] [(... They're huge.)]
 31:  358| [45] [Watase gulped.]
 32:  363| [47] [Watase]
 33:  364| [45] [(... This size sure as hell isn't normal... what cup is she!?)]
 34:  369| [45] [It was a wonder why he hadn't noticed those two well-rounded objects up until now.]
 35:  374| [47] [Watase]
 36:  375| [45] [(...! What the hell's wrong with me!? What kind of dumbass am I!?)]
 37:  380| [47] [Watase]
 38:  381| [45] [(Clean thoughts, Watase Kasasagi, clean thoughts! The survivors could be waiting to be rescued on this floor right now at this very second, and I'm just standing here and...!)]
 39:  386| [45] [But he couldn't clear his head of those thoughts.]
 40:  391| [45] [It wasn't long before Ena became taken aback and spoke.]
 41:  439| [47] [Ena]
 42:  442| [45] ["... Captain, you're not trying to hide something now, are you?"]
 43:  447| [47] [Watase]
 44:  448| [45] [(!? Is this woman an esper or something!?)]
 45:  456| [47] [Watase]
 46:  459| [45] ["Hahah, of course not... what makes you think that?"]
 47:  467| [47] [Ena]
 48:  470| [45] ["The fact that you suddenly stopped talking. I'm not liking this silence for some reason..."]
 49:  478| [47] [Watase]
 50:  481| [45] ["I was too focused on the climbing, that's why!"]
 51:  489| [47] [Ena]
 52:  492| [45] ["Liar. This isn't the same 'calm and composure' you had just a minute ago."]
 53:  500| [47] [Watase]
 54:  503| [45] ["Q-quit accusing me. I just got a bit too worked up, that's all."]
 55:  511| [47] [Watase]
 56:  514| [45] ["I was worried that we'd both get badly hurt if my hands slipped even for a second."]
 57:  519| [47] [Ena]
 58:  520| [45] ["..."]
 59:  568| [47] [Ena]
 60:  571| [45] ["... That's true. My safety -is- in your hands, after all."]
 61:  581| [45] [Ena smiled slightly and put some strength into her arms.]
 62:  589| [47] [Ena]
 63:  592| [45] ["I won't distract you anymore... I trust you, in a whole lot of ways."]
 64:  600| [47] [Watase]
 65:  603| [45] ["That's really good to know. Let's focus back on the searching for now."]
 66:  608| [45] [The two of them smiled at their playful conversation.]
 67:  613| [45] [... In hindsight, perhaps they were being a bit -too- carefree, given the situation.]
 68:  618| [45] [But small talk like that felt extremely precious to Watase.]
