  1:   77| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   78| [45] [(--It's no good! I don't know what I should do!)]
  3:   83| [45] [--couldn't come to a conclusion.]
  4:  114| [45] [In that moment of hesitation, Watase stole the gun from Natsuhiko.]
  5:  122| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  125| [45] ["Ahh!""]
  7:  130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  131| [45] [(He's gonna shoot!)]
  9:  136| [45] [Right after that thought crossed his mind--]
 10:  221| [45] [Fresh blood danced in the air to the sound of a dry whistle.]
 11:  346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  347| [45] [(--...!?)]
 13:  352| [45] [But nothing happened to Natsuhiko's body.]
 14:  357| [45] [--For Yuuri had promptly dived in front of him.]
 15:  411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  414| [45] ["Aah..."]
 17:  431| [45] [A gasp seeped from Natsuhiko's lips as Yuuri's body crumbled to the floor.]
 18:  439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  442| [45] ["Y... Yuuri!"]
 20:  447| [45] [Natsuhiko lifted her in his arms.]
 21:  452| [45] [His hands them came into contact with something warm and sticky:]
 22:  503| [45] [--A great river of blood seeping from Yuuri's head.]
 23:  511| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  514| [45] ["Hiko... rin..."]
 25:  519| [45] [Yuuri spoke with a fading voice.]
 26:  527| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  530| [45] ["Hikorin... I'm sorry..."]
 28:  550| [45] [That was all Yuuri said before falling silent.]
 29:  585| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  588| [45] ["Yuuri... Yuuri...!?"]
 31:  593| [45] [Natsuhiko shook her body.]
 32:  598| [45] [But there was no response. He could feel life slipping away from her body.]
 33:  603| [45] [--Yuuri was dead.]
 34:  608| [45] [Natsuhiko screamed once he realized that fact.]
 35:  690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  693| [45] ["Wataseeeeeee!!"]
 37:  733| [45] [Natsuhiko gave into emotion and grabbed at Watase.]
 38:  738| [45] [But Watase's hand was still wrapped around his gun.]
 39:  810| [45] [The gun spouted fire once more-- but this time, the bullet hit Natsuhiko.]
 40:  818| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  821| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
 42:  826| [45] [He felt an intense impact in his stomach.]
 43:  831| [45] [His legs lost strength and he nearly collapsed.]
 44:  885| [45] [But Natsuhiko steeled his feet and glared at Watase.]
 45:  893| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  896| [45] ["Wa... ta... se...!"]
 47:  922| [47] [Watase]
 48:  925| [45] ["... It hurts, doesn't it? That's Wataru's pain."]
 49:  930| [45] [Natsuhiko focused his mind as he heard that cold voice.]
 50:  982| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  983| [45] [(... I'll use Senses Sympathy once more...)]
 52:  988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  989| [45] [(I'll blow all of his memories away...!)]
 54:  994| [45] [Natsuhiko withstood the intense pain and tried to invoke that ability, but then--]
 55: 1020| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1023| [45] ["Feel Wataru's pain in hell! You damn Communicators!"]
 57: 1028| [45] [Watase shouted with rage as he pulled the trigger.]
 58: 1088| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1091| [45] ["!!"]
 60: 1096| [45] [An intense shock ran through Natsuhiko's left chest.]
 61: 1101| [45] [But he withstood the pain regardless.]
 62: 1158| [45] [Another gunshot blared and he felt intense pain in his eye.]
 63: 1199| [45] [A fifth gunshot, and he felt his throat rupture--]
 64: 1204| [45] [But even so, Natsuhiko stood firm.]
 65: 1218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1221| [45] ["----!!"]
 67: 1226| [45] [With a voiceless shout, Natsuhiko used the last of his ability.]
 68: 1231| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1232| [45] [(I'll destroy all of the memories that compose Watase's mind!)]
 70: 1293| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1296| [45] ["Ghh!?"]
 72: 1301| [45] [He heard Watase's pained voice. But Natsuhiko still did not let up.]
 73: 1306| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 1307| [45] [(I'll destroy every last memory in your mind! I won't leave even the smallest one behind!)]
 75: 1368| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1371| [45] ["Gah, ah, aah...!!"]
 77: 1376| [45] [Watase's agonized voice continued. But Natsuhiko still did not let up.]
 78: 1381| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1382| [45] [(I'll burn your brain into dust! Burn in hell, Watase!)]
 80: 1390| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1393| [45] ["Agghghghgh... gh-ghah! Ggggghhhh!"]
 82: 1454| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1457| [45] ["Gh... hh... nn."]
 84: 1462| [45] [In one moment, Natsuhiko heard that feeble voice--]
 85: 1483| [45] [And the next, he heard Watase collapse.]
 86: 1488| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1489| [45] [(I... I did it...)]
 88: 1494| [45] [But at that moment, Natsuhiko's body reached its limit as well.]
 89: 1522| [45] [He slowly collapsed on the spot.]
 90: 1527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1528| [45] [(Is... is this as far as I go...?)]
 92: 1533| [45] [There was nothing more that Natsuhiko could do.]
 93: 1594| [45] [He mustered the last remaining bit of his strength to grasp Yuuri's hand.]
 94: 1599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1600| [45] [(I'm sorry, Yuuri...)]
 96: 1605| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1606| [45] [(In the end, I couldn't protect you...)]
 98: 1611| [45] [Natsuhiko's mind was full of regret.]
 99: 1616| [45] [But at that moment, he thought he felt Yuuri grasp his hand back.]
100: 1621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1622| [45] [(Yuuri...)]
102: 1627| [45] [And hand in hand, their short lives came to a close.]
