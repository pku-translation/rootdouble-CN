  1:   80| [47] [Watase]
  2:   83| [45] ["--Let's find a way to escape."]
  3:   88| [45] [Watase said that to Kazami as they entered Area 3.]
  4:   96| [47] [Watase]
  5:   99| [45] ["If there's nowhere safe in the facility, then getting outside's our only shot."]
  6:  107| [47] [Watase]
  7:  110| [45] ["However, we can't try to end the lockdown by putting the fires out in Area N, naturally.%NWe'll have to find another way."]
  8:  136| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  139| [45] ["Yes...! But is there a way out somewhere else?"]
 10:  144| [47] [Watase]
 11:  145| [45] ["..."]
 12:  171| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  174| [45] ["Moribe and I searched high and low for one before you woke up. I'm sure the Commander and the other rescue workers outside did the same."]
 14:  182| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  185| [45] ["... But when you consider that there are no signs that they've broken their way in... our odds don't look very good."]
 16:  193| [47] [Watase]
 17:  196| [45] ["... Good point."]
 18:  201| [45] [Watase had also looked for alternate escape routes after they'd found that escape via the cargo lift was impossible.]
 19:  206| [45] [But then other problems had taken over while he'd tried (and failed) to do that.]
 20:  211| [45] [And now they were--]
 21:  219| [47] [Watase]
 22:  222| [45] ["...!?"]
 23:  227| [45] [Watase suddenly remembered something at that moment.]
 24:  235| [47] [Watase]
 25:  238| [45] ["Wait, that's right...!"]
 26:  264| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  267| [45] ["!? Have you remembered something!?"]
 28:  272| [45] [Watase nodded and looked Kazami in the eye.]
 29:  280| [47] [Watase]
 30:  283| [45] ["The pipes."]
 31:  291| [47] [Watase]
 32:  294| [45] ["Did you notice that thick pipe near the ceiling when we went to the engine room?"]
 33:  320| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  323| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
 35:  370| [47] [Watase]
 36:  373| [45] ["The old man told me that it's an intake pipe used to take water from the nearby lake to use as a coolant for the nuclear reactor."]
 37:  381| [47] [Watase]
 38:  384| [45] ["He also said that there was constantly water running through the pipe, so it'd leak out and flood LABO if we ever broke a hole in there--"]
 39:  396| [47] [Watase]
 40:  399| [45] ["But since there's no nuclear reactor, doesn't that cast doubt on the pipe's true purpose?"]
 41:  425| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  428| [45] ["...!"]
 43:  436| [47] [Watase]
 44:  439| [45] ["If that's just a dummy, and we can escape through there...!"]
 45:  465| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  468| [45] ["You're right... but I don't think it's a dummy."]
 47:  494| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  497| [45] ["Perhaps it acts as the coolant for that giant machine?"]
 49:  523| [47] [Kazami]
 50:  526| [45] ["If that's the case, then that means there's still a risk that LABO will flood if we break a hole in that pipe."]
 51:  534| [47] [Watase]
 52:  537| [45] ["I see... Dammit, if only we had a way to turn off the flow of water."]
 53:  563| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  566| [45] ["We may be able to come up with a plan if we figure out what that machine truly is...!"]
 55:  571| [45] [Once she said that--]
 56:  576| [45] [Watase's eyes widened.]
 57:  584| [47] [Watase]
 58:  587| [45] ["Hold on... that machine, it's...!?"]
 59:  613| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  616| [45] ["Huh?"]
 61:  624| [47] [Watase]
 62:  627| [45] ["I-I just remembered where I've seen that machine before!"]
 63:  653| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  656| [45] ["Where!?"]
 65:  664| [47] [Watase]
 66:  667| [45] ["The engine room!"]
 67:  675| [47] [Watase]
 68:  678| [45] ["There was a list of machine manuals in the terminal in that room--"]
 69:  686| [47] [Watase]
 70:  689| [45] ["And there was a picture of that giant machine on the very first page!"]
 71:  715| [47] [Kazami]
 72:  718| [45] ["!! You're right!"]
 73:  726| [47] [Watase]
 74:  729| [45] ["Maybe there's a way to turn off the water written in that very manual!"]
 75:  755| [47] [Kazami]
 76:  758| [45] ["C-Captain! Let's go check it out right away!"]
 77:  763| [45] [Watase nodded and headed for the engine room.]
 78:  861| [45] [--They entered the engine room for the first time in what felt like forever--]
 79:  866| [45] [Watase and Kazami laid Natsuhiko and Salyu onto the floor, ran up to the terminal, and began fiddling with it.]
 80:  913| [47] [Watase]
 81:  916| [45] ["'WX Particle Amplifier Operation Manual'... this is it!"]
 82:  921| [45] [Watase and Kazami brought their shoulders together as they looked over the image on the monitor.]
 83:  959| [45] ["WX particle amplifier operation manual"]
 84:  962| [85] [　]
 85:  965| [45] [<Introduction>]
 86:  968| [85] [　]
 87:  971| [45] [This document is an instruction manual for the WX particle amplifier.]
 88:  974| [45] [Due to the fact that there is great danger involved in its operation,%Nplease read the manual carefully before you proceed.]
 89:  977| [85] [　]
 90:  980| [45] [Furthermore, the properties of WX particles have extremely harmful effects to the body.]
 91:  983| [45] [Examples of this include dysesthesia, brain dysfunctions, genetic abnormalities, etc.]
 92:  986| [45] [The symptoms are dependent on the level of particle energy, as listed below:]
 93:  990| [45] [<Without AD>]
 94:  993| [85] [　]
 95:  996| [45] [      0 mSv-2000 mSv: No effects]
 96:  999| [85] [　]
 97: 1002| [45] [2000 mSv-4000 mSv: Dysesthesia, nausea, headaches, genetic abnormalities]
 98: 1005| [85] [　]
 99: 1008| [45] [4000 mSv-8000 mSV: brain dysfunctions, faint consciousness]
100: 1011| [85] [　]
101: 1014| [45] [8000 mSv-: unconsciousness]
102: 1017| [85] [　]
103: 1020| [45] [(The intensity and probability of displaying the aforementioned symptoms vary depending on the energy levels.)]
104: 1024| [45] [<With AD>]
105: 1027| [85] [　]
106: 1030| [45] [      0 mSv-6000 mSv : No effects]
107: 1033| [85] [　]
108: 1036| [45] [6000 mSv-8000 mSv: Dysesthesia, nausea, headaches, genetic abnormalities]
109: 1039| [85] [　]
110: 1042| [45] [8000 mSv-12000 mSv: brain dysfunctions, faint consciousness]
111: 1045| [85] [　]
112: 1048| [45] [12000 mSv- : unconsciousness]
113: 1051| [85] [　]

115: 1058| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N]
116: 1061| [45] [When using the amplifier normally, the particle energy levels should not exceed 2000 mSv.]
117: 1064| [85] [　]
118: 1067| [45] [When used for advanced experiments, the particle energy levels should not exceed 4000 mSv.]
119: 1096| [47] [Watase]
120: 1099| [45] ["Tachibana, do you have any idea what this thing's talking about?"]
121: 1128| [47] [Kazami]
122: 1131| [45] ["No... I've never even heard of WX particles before."]
123: 1139| [47] [Kazami]
124: 1142| [45] ["Though I can assume that they're similar to radiation in that they're both capable of having harmful effects to the body..."]
125: 1147| [45] [Watase felt the same. But now wasn't the time to be thinking about that.]
126: 1155| [47] [Watase]
127: 1158| [45] ["I don't see anything in here about coolant..."]
128: 1163| [45] [Watase read through the manual until a certain passage caught his eye.]
129: 1240| [45] [<Regarding Water Coolant System>]
130: 1243| [85] [　]
131: 1246| [45] [The amplifier generates large quantities of heat while in operation.]
132: 1249| [45] [Thus, a water coolant system has been installed in the engine room that takes in natural water from Lake Rokumei to utilize as coolant fluid.]
133: 1252| [45] [The coolant is drawn in through an "intake pipe" and is drained through a "drainage pipe".]
134: 1255| [45] [Both pipes are 1 m in diameter.%N2.4 cm thick.%NBoth have a volumetric flow rate of approximately 1200 liters per minute.]
135: 1258| [45] [The coolant taken in by the intake pipe is drained once it has increased in temperature by approximately 25 degrees Celsius.]
136: 1261| [85] [　]
137: 1264| [45] [(In other words, if Lake Rokumei is at 28 degrees Celsius during August, the coolant is expelled at 53 degrees Celsius.)]
138: 1269| [85] [　]
139: 1272| [45] [The control of the water flow is carried out by a "forced circulation pump" located in the drainage pipe.]
140: 1275| [45] [Furthermore, there is a "filtering mechanism" within the intake pipe in order to prevent any foreign bodies from contaminating the coolant fluid.]
141: 1278| [45] [The filtering mechanism operates at high speeds to ensure that only distilled/filtered water%Nis used as coolant.]
142: 1281| [45] [The expulsion of foreign bodies such as algae is carried out by a foreign body expulsion outlet located in the filtering mechanism.]
143: 1284| [45] [Should the filtering mechanism ever break down, there is a risk of unfiltered water entering the amplifier and causing severe damage.]
144: 1287| [45] [Therefore, a "floodgate" located in the intake pipe will close in the event that the filtering mechanism breaks down, thereby preventing the flow of unfiltered water.]
145: 1290| [45] [At the same time, the forced circulation pump and amplifier will cease operation, stopping the flow of coolant.]
146: 1293| [45] [The location of each device can be seen in the diagram below.]
147: 1322| [47] [Watase]
148: 1325| [45] ["... This is it...!"]
149: 1330| [45] [Watase muttered that in a low voice as he looked at it.]
150: 1338| [47] [Watase]
151: 1341| [45] ["So this really is our only way out!"]
152: 1350| [45] [He looked up at the ceiling to find the "intake pipe" and "drainage pipe" running side by side.]
153: 1355| [45] [There was a ladder next to the pipes that led right up to them.]
154: 1360| [45] [Watase strained his ears and heard the sound of water running.]
155: 1365| [45] [He could also see a large machine located below the intake pipe: it was apparently the "filtering mechanism".]
156: 1373| [47] [Watase]
157: 1376| [45] ["If we damage-- no, destroy the filtering mechanism, then that'll stop the water from running."]
158: 1384| [47] [Watase]
159: 1387| [45] ["Then we can escape to Lake Rokumei through the pipe!"]
160: 1413| [47] [Kazami]
161: 1416| [45] ["You're right...!"]
162: 1442| [47] [Kazami]
163: 1445| [45] ["But what do you plan on doing after you've stopped the water from running?"]
164: 1453| [47] [Watase]
165: 1456| [45] ["Huh?"]
166: 1503| [47] [Kazami]
167: 1506| [45] ["According to this diagram, the 'intake pipe' is located under Lake Rokumei's water level."]
168: 1514| [47] [Kazami]
169: 1517| [45] ["Meaning LABO will still be flooded if you open a hole in it, running water or not."]
170: 1525| [47] [Watase]
171: 1528| [45] ["So that means opening a hole in the drainage pipe instead is probably our only shot..."]
172: 1536| [47] [Watase]
173: 1539| [45] ["If we stop the water and then open a hole on -top- of the pipe, then that means not much water should leak out of it."]
174: 1547| [47] [Kazami]
175: 1550| [45] ["However, the drainage pipe is filled with all that heated water from that amplifier."]
176: 1558| [47] [Kazami]
177: 1561| [45] ["So if it really is 53 degrees Celsius, you won't last in there."]
178: 1569| [47] [Watase]
179: 1572| [45] ["...!"]
180: 1580| [47] [Kazami]
181: 1583| [45] ["We could always open a hole on the bottom of the drainage pipe and drain all the water out of it that way, but..."]
182: 1591| [47] [Watase]
183: 1594| [45] ["... Yeah, too dangerous. We don't know how much water will come pouring out of that thing."]
184: 1602| [47] [Watase]
185: 1605| [45] ["So in the slight chance that we get floods after floods of water coming out... then there's a possibility everyone still here will drown."]
186: 1613| [47] [Watase]
187: 1616| [45] ["That means Yuuri, Moribe, the old man... and all the other survivors."]
188: 1624| [47] [Kazami]
189: 1627| [45] ["... We can't risk everything on an all or nothing bet."]
190: 1635| [47] [Watase]
191: 1638| [45] ["Which means we really should just open a hole on top of the drainage pipe."]
192: 1646| [47] [Kazami]
193: 1649| [45] ["Then that means we have three problems that we have to solve first--"]
194: 1657| [47] [Kazami]
195: 1660| [45] ["#1: How do we open a hole in the pipe?"]
196: 1668| [47] [Kazami]
197: 1671| [45] ["#2: How do we ensure that we can breathe inside the flooded pipe?"]
198: 1679| [47] [Kazami]
199: 1682| [45] ["#3: How do we walk through 500 m of 53 degree Celsius water from here to Lake Rokumei...?!"]
200: 1709| [47] [Watase]
201: 1712| [45] ["Let's think of a way. If we solve those problems, we're home free!"]
202: 1720| [47] [Kazami]
203: 1723| [45] ["Yes!"]
204: 1728| [45] [Watase and Kazami looked at each other and started thinking.]
205: 1754| [47] [Kazami]
206: 1757| [45] ["Let's figure out how to open a hole in the pipe first."]
207: 1765| [47] [Kazami]
208: 1768| [45] ["If we could somehow take the engine cutter from Moribe..."]
209: 1776| [47] [Watase]
210: 1779| [45] ["No, out of the question. We have an alternative to that anyway."]
211: 1805| [47] [Kazami]
212: 1808| [45] ["Huh?"]
213: 1816| [47] [Watase]
214: 1819| [45] ["Hiyama's axe. It's lying in Area N right now."]
215: 1827| [47] [Watase]
216: 1830| [45] ["If the pipe's just 2.4 cm thick, then I shouldn't have any trouble opening up a hole in that thing with a little elbow grease."]
217: 1856| [47] [Kazami]
218: 1859| [45] ["... You think you can do it?"]
219: 1867| [47] [Watase]
220: 1870| [45] ["Just who do you think I am?"]
221: 1893| [45] [Kazami grinned when she saw Watase trying to act tough.]
222: 1901| [47] [Kazami]
223: 1904| [45] ["... I trust you!"]
224: 1912| [47] [Watase]
225: 1915| [45] ["All right! Then next step! How do we keep breathing through the flooded pipe!?"]
226: 1941| [47] [Kazami]
227: 1944| [45] ["I have an idea about that."]
228: 1952| [47] [Watase]
229: 1955| [45] ["What is it?"]
230: 1963| [47] [Kazami]
231: 1966| [45] ["There's an air tank in the makeshift base. It has enough air in it to last about 20 minutes."]
232: 1992| [47] [Kazami]
233: 1995| [45] ["I cannot say for certain that it's enough to get through 500 m of water... but it's our only chance."]
234: 2003| [47] [Watase]
235: 2006| [45] ["But I thought we couldn't use the air tank because the suit's faceplate is broken?"]
236: 2032| [47] [Kazami]
237: 2035| [45] ["It'll be all right. You'll be fine so long as you grab on to the hose sticking out of the tank and put it directly in your mouth."]
238: 2043| [47] [Kazami]
239: 2046| [45] ["We don't do that during firefighting dispatches because it leaves you with only one free hand and doesn't allow you to talk."]
240: 2072| [47] [Kazami]
241: 2075| [45] ["So I never suggested it up until now, but--"]
242: 2083| [47] [Watase]
243: 2086| [45] ["If all I'm doing is walking through the water, then it might turn out okay, huh..."]
244: 2091| [45] [It was a very risky plan, but one they had to bet on.]
245: 2096| [45] [Their plan was looking more and more feasible with each problem they tackled.]
246: 2101| [45] [But for all their efforts-- the true problem still remained.]
247: 2109| [47] [Watase]
248: 2112| [45] ["... Okay then, let's move on to the last problem."]
249: 2120| [47] [Watase]
250: 2123| [45] ["'#3: How to withstand 53 degrees Celsius water...!"]
251: 2128| [45] [Kazami nodded and answered.]
252: 2154| [47] [Kazami]
253: 2157| [45] ["The first thing you should know is that '53 degree Celsius air' is not the same thing as '53 degree Celsius water'."]
254: 2165| [47] [Kazami]
255: 2168| [45] ["Since sweat cannot evaporate to cool the skin underwater, hot water does far more damage to the body than hot air."]
256: 2194| [47] [Kazami]
257: 2197| [45] ["You've never been in a 53 degree Celsius bath, right? That's because your body could never withstand water of that temperature."]
258: 2205| [47] [Watase]
259: 2208| [45] ["Hmm..."]
260: 2234| [47] [Kazami]
261: 2237| [45] ["So... should we wait for the water to cool down after we stop it from running?"]
262: 2245| [47] [Watase]
263: 2248| [45] ["That'd be the best way, but it'd probably take too much time..."]
264: 2256| [47] [Watase]
265: 2259| [45] ["A 2.4 cm pipe's gotta be a lot like a thermos, right?"]
266: 2285| [47] [Kazami]
267: 2288| [45] ["Indeed..."]
268: 2296| [47] [Watase]
269: 2299| [45] ["... What if we tried running it once we've confirmed the water temperature's gone down a little and risk a burn?"]
270: 2307| [47] [Kazami]
271: 2310| [45] ["Even if we could withstand it, the survivors-- especially Tenkawa-- are badly wounded. I do not believe they'd last."]
272: 2318| [47] [Watase]
273: 2321| [45] ["I see... taking Natsuhiko with us out of here is already difficult enough as it is anyway, isn't it?"]
274: 2347| [47] [Kazami]
275: 2350| [45] ["But if just one of us manages to escape, they can contact the Commander and the others and have them help us..."]
276: 2358| [47] [Kazami]
277: 2361| [45] ["Or they could even call the police. Then they'd be able to restrain Mr. Ukita and Moribe."]
278: 2369| [47] [Watase]
279: 2372| [45] ["... So then what you're saying is..."]
280: 2380| [47] [Watase]
281: 2383| [45] ["We need to find a way so that at least one of us can endure the water temperature and escape, huh...?"]
282: 2428| [45] [Watase thought carefully about everything he'd been through up until this point.]
283: 2433| [45] [He mobilized all the excessive knowledge he'd gained in the last five hours.]
284: 2438| [47] [Watase]
285: 2439| [45] [(Think... is there anything in this facility right now that can withstand heat?)]
286: 2444| [45] [He and Kazami were wearing firefighting suits. They had fire resistant properties, but they probably wouldn't be any use against hot water.]
287: 2449| [45] [What's more, there were cuts in them all over their sleeves and neck area, so water would just get in from there.]
288: 2454| [47] [Watase]
289: 2455| [45] [(Then is there anything we can use to completely seal the damaged spots...?)]
290: 2460| [45] [But even if they could, their faces were still completely exposed, so it was probably impossible to make the whole thing airtight.]
291: 2465| [47] [Watase]
292: 2466| [45] [(C'mon, don't give up! Think! There's just gotta be a way!)]
293: 2471| [45] [He remembered everything he'd seen up until this point.]
294: 2476| [45] [First, there was the gear he'd observed in the makeshift base: the air tank, air jack, AD, Procyon, and engine cutter.]
295: 2481| [45] [Next was the things he had on him: his PDA and security card. Both were useless here.]
296: 2486| [45] [Finally, there was what they'd found in the facility: the transfusion packs, transfusion kit, oxygen tank, Chiron, distilled water, the pistol-- all of them useless!]
297: 2491| [47] [Watase]
298: 2492| [45] [(Did I see anything else!? The answer has to be there! I know it!)]
299: 2497| [45] [He look back on the path he'd taken to reach this point.]
300: 2502| [45] [He'd woken up, met Kazami and Jun, then saved Yuuri.]
301: 2507| [45] [They'd geared up at the makeshift base, met Ena and Ukita, then began their search after seeing the images of Natsuhiko and the others.]
302: 2512| [45] [They'd discovered their coworker's body, but still continued the search regardless, then turned on the sprinkler system and put out the fires--]
303: 2524| [47] [Watase]
304: 2527| [45] ["Aah...!"]
305: 2532| [45] [Watase gasped.]
306: 2537| [45] [He remembered something Kazami had said.]
307: 2651| [45] [--Something way back at the start of the search, when they were at the makeshift base--]
308: 2677| [47] [Kazami]
309: 2680| [45] ["Incidentally, we also had two 'radiation protection suits'..."]
310: 2688| [47] [Kazami]
311: 2691| [45] ["But they got damaged while we were putting out fires, so we can't use them anymore."]
312: 2717| [47] [Kazami]
313: 2720| [45] ["They were fine pieces of equipment with excellent fire and water resistance, airtight, and even allowed you to connect an air tank directly to their facepieces--"]
314: 2725| [45] [Kazami had told him that as she'd been pointing to the ruined protection suits.]
315: 2730| [45] [Their faceplates had been cracked.]
316: 2782| [47] [Watase]
317: 2785| [45] ["...!"]
318: 2832| [45] [He then remembered another thing he'd seen a while back..]
319: 2837| [45] [A body whose lower half had been burned, wearing a--!]
320: 2923| [45] [Watase's eyes widened.]
321: 2928| [45] [Those two memories held the answer he needed.]
322: 2936| [47] [Watase]
323: 2939| [45] ["I... I got it."]
324: 2965| [47] [Kazami]
325: 2968| [45] ["Huh?"]
326: 2976| [47] [Watase]
327: 2979| [45] ["I figured out a way to get through the hot water!"]
328: 3005| [47] [Kazami]
329: 3008| [45] ["Wh-what is it!?"]
330: 3016| [47] [Watase]
331: 3019| [45] ["The protection suits... They finally proved useful at the very end."]
332: 3024| [45] [Kazami had said that the protection suits were airtight and had high water resistance.]
333: 3029| [45] [So if he wore one of them, hot water wouldn't leak in.]
334: 3034| [45] [That would turn the "53 degree Celsius water" into "53 degree Celsius air"--a temperature he could withstand!]
335: 3060| [47] [Kazami]
336: 3063| [45] ["But our protection suits have already been damaged...!"]
337: 3071| [47] [Watase]
338: 3074| [45] ["Don't worry. I already have a backup plan for that."]
339: 3100| [47] [Kazami]
340: 3103| [45] ["What backup plan?"]
341: 3111| [47] [Watase]
342: 3114| [45] ["I need to go gather the things we'll need to escape right now."]
343: 3122| [47] [Watase]
344: 3125| [45] ["Could you stay with these kids and wait here?"]
345: 3151| [47] [Kazami]
346: 3154| [45] ["...!"]
347: 3159| [45] [Hesitation filled Kazami's eyes.]
348: 3164| [45] [It was indeed dangerous to go off on one's own in the facility now that Ukita and Jun were prowling it. However--]
349: 3172| [47] [Watase]
350: 3175| [45] ["I know you're worried, but one person moving around will stick out less than two.%NPlease don't try it."]
351: 3180| [45] [Watase said that and stepped on the ladder.]
352: 3188| [47] [Watase]
353: 3191| [45] ["I'll be right back as soon as I get all the gear."]
354: 3217| [47] [Kazami]
355: 3220| [45] ["A... all right! Be careful!"]
356: 3225| [45] [Watase nodded and descended the ladder as fast as he could.]
357: 3274| [45] [--He then headed for the makeshift base in Area 2.]
358: 3323| [45] [He picked up the air tank and one of the wrecked protection suits.]
359: 3328| [47] [Watase]
360: 3329| [45] [(This won't be enough to get us out of here...)]
361: 3334| [45] [Watase took off the cracked faceplate, threw it aside, then ran out of the base.]
362: 3421| [45] [--He went through Area N, picked up the axe there,]
363: 3508| [45] [then headed straight for Area 4 this time.]
364: 3513| [47] [Watase]
365: 3514| [45] [(... All the protection suits I've seen so far have been damaged in some way.)]
366: 3519| [47] [Watase]
367: 3520| [45] [(Tachibana and Moribe's have broken faceplates, Dojima's was all battered up, and the lower half of Hiyama's completely burned up...)]
368: 3525| [47] [Watase]
369: 3526| [45] [(But-- if I combine them together--!)]
370: 3531| [45] [Watase ran into the elevator hall with that thought in mind.]
371: 3577| [45] [He then found himself faced with Hiyama's body.]
372: 3585| [47] [Watase]
373: 3588| [45] ["Sorry about this, Hiyama..."]
374: 3593| [45] [Watase apologized to Hiyama and then--]
375: 3642| [45] [ripped his faceplate off.]
376: 3687| [47] [Watase]
377: 3688| [45] [(Now I have everything I need...!)]
378: 3693| [45] [He had the axe, an air tank, a perfectly intact faceplate, and an undamaged protection suit.]
379: 3747| [45] [Watase carried them all and went off running again.]
380: 3752| [45] [He headed towards the engine room, where Kazami and the kids were waiting for him.]
