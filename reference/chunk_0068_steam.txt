  1:   69| [45] [Watase nodded and was about to leave the room--]
  2:  115| [45] [When the body of the girl crossed his line of sight.]
  3:  120| [47] [Watase]
  4:  121| [45] [(...)]
  5:  126| [45] [A thought suddenly crossed his head, and so he called out to Jun.]
  6:  159| [47] [Watase]
  7:  162| [45] ["... Moribe."]
  8:  188| [47] [Jun]
  9:  191| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 10:  199| [47] [Watase]
 11:  202| [45] ["Are you sure you'll be okay in here all by yourself...?"]
 12:  263| [47] [Jun]
 13:  266| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean by th..."]
 14:  271| [45] [Jun suddenly gulped before she could finish.]
 15:  276| [45] [It seemed she'd only just now remembered she was alone with a body.]
 16:  284| [47] [Watase]
 17:  287| [45] ["Every time you see a body... you get really down, so..."]
 18:  310| [47] [Jun]
 19:  311| [45] ["..."]
 20:  316| [45] [Jun's face froze over at Watase's comment.]
 21:  321| [45] [But-- she quickly shook her head as if to wipe that away.]
 22:  347| [47] [Jun]
 23:  350| [45] ["... Yeah, you're right. I really am weak, huh?"]
 24:  358| [47] [Jun]
 25:  361| [45] ["Makes me remember Dojima and Hiyama..."]
 26:  369| [47] [Watase]
 27:  372| [45] ["You shouldn't be so down on yourself. Anyone would be that way after seeing something like that..."]
 28:  377| [45] [Jun laughed slightly.]
 29:  403| [47] [Jun]
 30:  406| [45] ["... You sure don't look that way. You look totally fine."]
 31:  414| [47] [Watase]
 32:  417| [45] ["I don't think I'd say that..."]
 33:  425| [47] [Jun]
 34:  428| [45] ["But you've seen just as many bodies as we have, yet you don't show any sorrow and just keep leading us on."]
 35:  436| [47] [Jun]
 36:  439| [45] ["You really are way stronger than I am, even without memories."]
 37:  465| [47] [Jun]
 38:  468| [45] ["... I'm sorry for looking down on you when this whole thing began. You really are our captain, amnesia or not."]
 39:  473| [45] [Watase couldn't help but let his true feelings out when he saw Jun look so guilty.]
 40:  481| [47] [Watase]
 41:  484| [45] ["... You've got it all wrong."]
 42:  510| [47] [Jun]
 43:  513| [45] ["Huh?"]
 44:  521| [47] [Watase]
 45:  524| [45] ["I just don't feel sad, that's all."]
 46:  532| [47] [Watase]
 47:  535| [45] ["Dojima and Hiyama died so cruelly, but it just doesn't feel real to me at all... more like something that happened in a TV show..."]
 48:  543| [47] [Watase]
 49:  546| [45] ["So I have no right at all to be called 'strong'."]
 50:  554| [47] [Watase]
 51:  557| [45] ["Maybe I just don't understand the value of life very well to begin with..."]
 52:  562| [45] [Jun then cut in before Watase could say any more.]
 53:  588| [47] [Jun]
 54:  591| [45] ["But you still tried to save Yuuri, remember?"]
 55:  599| [47] [Watase]
 56:  602| [45] ["Huh?"]
 57:  610| [47] [Jun]
 58:  613| [45] ["There's no way in hell someone who didn't understand the value of life would be so desperate about trying to save someone."]
 59:  621| [47] [Jun]
 60:  624| [45] ["The only reason you're not sad... is just because you lost your memories and forgot about Dojima and Hiyama, right?"]
 61:  632| [47] [Watase]
 62:  635| [45] ["But... both you and Tachibana were practically grieving on the spot when you saw this girl, didn't you?"]
 63:  643| [47] [Watase]
 64:  646| [45] ["Yet I didn't. So maybe I really don't..."]
 65:  651| [45] [When Watase looked over at the girl's body, Jun also glanced at the girl for a second.]
 66:  677| [47] [Jun]
 67:  680| [45] ["Well... I don't think it was as hard on me as it was on the Lieutenant, but I'm sure it's because..."]
 68:  688| [47] [Jun]
 69:  691| [45] ["... this girl kinda looks like Nagisa..."]
 70:  699| [47] [Watase]
 71:  702| [45] ["...!?"]
 72:  707| [45] [Watase felt extreme surprise when he heard that.]
 73:  712| [45] ["Nagisa" was Kazami's little sister who'd passed away almost ten years ago.]
 74:  717| [45] [So for Jun to say that they "looked alike" meant that--]
 75:  725| [47] [Watase]
 76:  728| [45] ["M-Moribe... was that Nagisa an acquaintance of yours?"]
 77:  754| [47] [Jun]
 78:  757| [45] ["An acquaintance? Not even close."]
 79:  765| [47] [Jun]
 80:  768| [45] ["She was my best friend."]
 81:  776| [47] [Watase]
 82:  779| [45] ["...!"]
 83:  784| [45] [Watase gasped. Jun continued with a depressed frown.]
 84:  810| [47] [Jun]
 85:  813| [45] ["... Actually, she was more like a little sister than a best friend. There was a bit of a gap in our ages, y'see."]
 86:  821| [47] [Jun]
 87:  824| [45] ["The lieutenant was like my older sister while Nagisa was like my little sister.%NThe three of us felt like family."]
 88:  850| [47] [Jun]
 89:  853| [45] ["So Nagisa had a huge influence on both me and the Lieutenant..."]
 90:  861| [47] [Jun]
 91:  864| [45] ["When I look at this girl, it just reminds me of Nagisa's face at her funeral all those years ago..."]
 92:  872| [47] [Watase]
 93:  875| [45] ["Then I really should stay here, shouldn't I...?"]
 94:  898| [47] [Jun]
 95:  899| [45] ["..."]
 96:  907| [47] [Watase]
 97:  910| [45] ["Just because you're a rescue worker doesn't mean you have to always keep your heart hardened for as long as you live, right?"]
 98:  915| [45] [Watase could see a pondering look pass by Jun's face for a moment--]
 99:  920| [45] [But her eyes soon lit up.]
100:  946| [47] [Jun]
101:  949| [45] ["... Captain, thanks for being so considerate of me."]
102:  957| [47] [Jun]
103:  960| [45] ["But I wouldn't be able to call myself a rescue worker anymore if I accepted your offer."]
104:  968| [47] [Jun]
105:  971| [45] ["Hurry, go on and help Mr. Ukita. I'll be okay."]
106:  979| [47] [Watase]
107:  982| [45] ["..."]
108:  987| [45] [Watase was still worried-- but he couldn't deny Jun of her determination.]
109:  992| [45] [So he made up his mind.]
110: 1000| [47] [Watase]
111: 1003| [45] ["All right... but call for me right away if something happens."]
112: 1029| [47] [Jun]
113: 1032| [45] ["Roger!"]
114: 1037| [45] [And with that typical exchange between them, Watase left the room.]
