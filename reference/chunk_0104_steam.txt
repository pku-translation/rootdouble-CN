  1:  107| [45] [The sea of flames was still there.]
  2:  114| [45] [His Procyon's alarm beeped a second later.]
  3:  125| [45] [It read "4452 mSv"--]
  4:  130| [45] [That was a dangerous level of radiation to Watase, given that he'd only injected himself with a half-dose AD.]
  5:  135| [45] [His skin immediately felt uncomfortable, and his headache swiftly came back with a vengeance.]
  6:  141| [47] [Watase]
  7:  142| [45] [(Khh... but I can't just be the only one not doing anything here...!)]
  8:  147| [45] [He could see Kazami and Jun holding two hoses as they desperately suppressed the fire,%Nthe sound of the Procyon's alarm beeping in the background.]
  9:  152| [45] [Watase gnashed his teeth and quickly ran over to them.]
 10:  185| [47] [Jun]
 11:  188| [45] ["Oh, you came back!?"]
 12:  229| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  232| [45] ["Captain, are you sure you're okay!?"]
 14:  240| [47] [Watase]
 15:  243| [45] ["Yeah, no worries."]
 16:  251| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  254| [45] ["But your face is pa--"]
 18:  262| [47] [Watase]
 19:  265| [45] ["Your concern is unnecessary. Anyway, is there something I can do to help?"]
 20:  276| [45] [Watase checked the area to find nearly all of it engulfed in flames.]
 21:  281| [45] [With the air full of heat waves and steam, every breath he took felt like it was setting his lungs on fire.]
 22:  307| [47] [Jun]
 23:  310| [45] ["Well, yeah, we wish you could help us put out these fires. It's just--"]
 24:  336| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  339| [45] ["This fire is already beyond human help at this point...!"]
 26:  347| [47] [Watase]
 27:  350| [45] ["Khh..."]
 28:  355| [45] [But, figuring it was better than doing nothing, Watase started to look for a fire extinguisher when--]
 29:  489| [45] [Some of the nearby flames surged upward fiercely.]
 30:  494| [45] [A tongue of flame which had been licking at the ceiling nimbly waved towards the floor.]
 31:  508| [47] [Watase]
 32:  511| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 33:  560| [47] [Jun]
 34:  563| [45] ["Oh shit, it's rolling over!"]
 35:  620| [47] [Kazami]
 36:  623| [45] ["We'll never last against that! All hands retreat!"]
 37:  628| [45] [Even Watase could tell that whatever was happening was no laughing matter.]
 38:  634| [45] [--But at that moment.]
 39:  665| [47] [Watase]
 40:  666| [45] [(Ghh, not now...!)]
 41:  754| [45] [A headache strong enough to numb his whole body hit Watase, forcing him to lean against the wall.]
 42:  819| [47] [Jun]
 43:  822| [45] ["C-Captain!?"]
 44:  849| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  852| [45] ["Oh no! Moribe, give me a hand!"]
 46:  931| [45] [Kazami and Jun threw aside their hoses as they carried Watase from both sides.]
 47:  939| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  942| [45] ["Captain, please hang in there!"]
 49:  950| [47] [Jun]
 50:  953| [45] ["C'mon, we've gotta get out of here!"]
 51: 1018| [45] [They did their best to essentially drag him over to the landing of the emergency staircase--]
 52: 1023| [45] [But then Watase turned around and witnessed a strange phenomenon.]
 53: 1028| [47] [Watase]
 54: 1029| [45] [(Wh-what's that--!?)]
 55: 1034| [45] [The smoke surrounding the fire turned yellow.]
 56: 1039| [45] [Jun and Kazami gasped when then saw it.]
 57: 1072| [47] [Jun]
 58: 1075| [45] ["--Aaaaah!!"]
 59: 1116| [47] [Kazami]
 60: 1119| [45] ["No! If this keeps up--!"]
 61: 1133| [45] [--It's coming.]
 62: 1138| [45] [Though he didn't know what it was, Watase was sure of that.]
 63: 1143| [45] [At that moment, all sound vanished from the world. It was like even time itself had stopped.]
 64: 1148| [45] [One second before Watase was hit with the death he knew was coming for him, a memory replayed in his head.]
 65: 1237| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1240| [45] ["Just hand it over!"]
 67: 1266| [47] [Kazami]
 68: 1269| [45] ["Ah!"]
 69: 1301| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1304| [45] ["Wha... what have you done!?"]
 71: 1312| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1315| [45] ["I had no choice... talking wasn't going to get us anywhere."]
 73: 1385| [45] [Things would have probably turned out differently if Watase had taken a full AD back then.]
 74: 1390| [45] [But it was far too late to regret it.]
 75: 1395| [45] [The yellow flames then turned into a sinister black, and then--!]
 76: 1448| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1451| [45] ["!!!!"]
 78: 1465| [47] [Kazami & Jun]
 79: 1468| [45] ["Aaaaaah!"]
 80: 1549| [45] [The red hot gas that was swelling up through the block instantly incinerated the three of them into ashes.]

 82: 1688| [45] [√A Bad Ending #3 [The Overeager Martyr]]
 83: 1691| [85] [　]
 84: 1694| [45] [The result of Watase worrying too much about Kazami and taking the half-empty AD.]
 85: 1697| [85] [　]
 86: 1700| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Watase's Senses higher than Kazami's at an SSS input around 10:16 AM.]
