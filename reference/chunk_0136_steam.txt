  0:   77| [55] [√Before Chapter 1]
  1:   85| [45] [After leaving school, Natsuhiko and Mashiro took a bus to the heart of the city.]
  2:  140| [45] [Right beside the bus stop was the shopping area.]
  3:  145| [45] [There stood a staggering amount of people.]
  4:  232| [47] [Mashiro]
  5:  235| [45] ["Hyah, it's so crowded."]
  6:  259| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  262| [45] ["But we came all this way, so we can't back down now."]
  8:  288| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  291| [45] ["Yeah, nothing ventured, nothing gained, I guess."]
 10:  324| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro marched into the shopping area in high spirits.]
 11:  347| [45] [--About an hour later--]
 12:  407| [45] [Upon exiting the building, Mashiro stretched as she spoke.]
 13:  433| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  436| [45] ["Man, I sure splurged, huh?"]
 15:  444| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  447| [45] ["Oh shut up. You bought too many unnecessary things, you know?"]
 17:  452| [45] [Natsuhiko complained, both his arms burdened with bags.]
 18:  457| [45] [In addition to doing the groceries, Mashiro also stopped by a second-hand toy shop in the shopping area and made some purchases there.]
 19:  462| [45] [She bought old anime figures and magazines, data disks, and other various goods beyond Natsuhiko's comprehension.]
 20:  470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  473| [45] ["Geez. Can't believe you're making me carry all of this..."]
 22:  499| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  502| [45] ["I couldn't help it! They had so many precious little treasures in there, you know?"]
 24:  528| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  531| [45] ["Like this April 2020 issue of Animaze!"]
 26:  539| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  542| [45] ["It has a special feature article on that one now-legendary anime director~"]
 28:  547| [45] [Mashiro started talking about the ten-year-old anime magazine she just bought.]
 29:  574| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  577| [45] ["The director's masterpiece has got to be the national broadcast anime, 'Psychic Girl Beyond*BEYOND'..."]
 31:  603| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  606| [45] ["And its super-rare radio drama is included on the magazine's supplemental data disk!"]
 33:  614| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  617| [45] ["And there's even 30 pages of precious director interviews and production materials!"]
 35:  643| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  646| [45] ["And they were selling it at list price! How could I -not- buy it!?"]
 37:  654| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  657| [45] ["Hmm... well, that might be amazing, but I really don't understand its value at all."]
 39:  683| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  686| [45] ["That's no good, Natsuhiko. 'You cannot see the treasure that lies before your eyes, and that is what makes you a truly sad human being'."]
 41:  694| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  697| [45] ["What's that supposed to mean?"]
 43:  723| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  726| [45] ["It's a famous quote from 'BeyoBEYO'. In anime episode 13."]
 45:  780| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  783| [45] ["Oh, I see... Not that I care."]
 47:  788| [45] [One of Mashiro's bad habits was that she frequently quoted lines from anime and manga.]
 48:  793| [45] [But without the context of the lines, they didn't really leave much of an impression.%NMost of these so-called "famous quotes" of hers were like that.]
 49:  801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  804| [45] ["Geez... for an upstanding high school girl, you're such an otaku."]
 51:  830| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  833| [45] ["Heheh. That word's been so overused by the general public that it's obsolete now, you know."]
 53:  849| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  852| [45] ["Well, I guess I do feel a bit jealous that you can have so many hobbies, though."]
 55:  878| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  881| [45] ["You really don't have any hobbies, do you, Natsuhiko? Why not take this opportunity to get your feet wet?"]
 57:  907| [47] [Mashiro]
 58:  910| [45] ["I think it'd be fun to teach you everything there is to know about manga, movies, games, and anime... teeheehee..."]
 59:  918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  921| [45] ["You don't have to teach me everything. Even I know a little bit. I have watched anime back when I was a kid, you know."]
 61:  930| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  933| [45] ["Like 'Esper Suit Beyonder', and... uh... 'Beyonder'."]
 63:  959| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  962| [45] ["So all you know is Beyonder! Well, you did love it when you were a kid."]
 65:  970| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  973| [45] ["Though I still don't really watch that sort of stuff anymore. I mean, it -is- just for kids after all."]
 67:  999| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 1002| [45] ["Ahh, how sad. You've forgotten your inner child, haven't you, Natsuhiko?"]
 69: 1014| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1017| [45] ["What, should I have said it's for 'hobbyists', then?"]
 71: 1043| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1046| [45] ["Yup. Hobbies are the spice of life, you know?"]
 73: 1072| [47] [Mashiro]
 74: 1075| [45] ["What about you, Natsuhiko? Why not take this opportunity to get your feet wet?"]
 75: 1101| [47] [Mashiro]
 76: 1104| [45] ["I think it'd be fun to teach you everything there is to know about manga, movies, games, and anime... teeheehee..."]
 77: 1112| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1115| [45] ["There you go again, trying to push your hobbies onto others. That's a bad habit of yours, you know?"]
 79: 1141| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1144| [45] ["Tch, you're so stubborn."]
 81: 1149| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly at Mashiro's disappointment.]
 82: 1200| [45] [--She really got along with Natsuhiko as if she were an easygoing boy his age.]
 83: 1205| [45] [But she also had the disposition of a caring elder sister and it wasn't uncommon at all for her to help him out.]
 84: 1210| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1211| [45] [(She's a good kid... The only troubling thing about her is her otaku hobbies.)]
 86: 1216| [45] [Her natural boyishness seemed to have guided her in an increasingly peculiar direction as the years went by.]
 87: 1235| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1238| [45] ["... Well, whatever. More importantly, we should get going soon. We've got a lot to carry, too."]
 89: 1264| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1267| [45] ["Oh, right. Sorry."]
 91: 1375| [45] [The two of them headed to the nearby bus stop.]
 92: 1471| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1474| [45] ["When's the next bus?"]
 94: 1500| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1503| [45] ["Let's see... looks like it'll be here in about ten minutes."]
 96: 1511| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1514| [45] ["Good. We won't have to wait very long, then."]
 98: 1566| [45] [The two of them stood there and waited for the bus.]
 99: 1571| [45] [Mashiro whispered, gazing at the city.]
100: 1597| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1600| [45] ["Man, there were so many people here today for a weekday."]
102: 1608| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1611| [45] ["I guess it's because the city population itself has been growing recently."]
104: 1616| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around at the surrounding cityscape.]
105: 1803| [45] [--"Rokumei City" was a small provincial city.]
106: 1808| [45] [However, it was home to more than 300 research facilities and over 10,000 researchers.]
107: 1813| [45] [It was a research university town leading in Japan's cutting-edge science.]
108: 1818| [45] [The facilities covered a broad range of topics. Some key examples being--]
109: 2047| [45] [・Nuclear Power]
110: 2051| [45] [・Biology]
111: 2055| [45] [・Physics]
112: 2068| [45] [・Medicine]
113: 2072| [45] [・Life Sciences]
114: 2076| [45] [・Environmental Science and Technology]
115: 2126| [45] [・Space Research and Development]
116: 2130| [45] [・Natural Disaster Prevention]
117: 2180| [45] [・Computer Science]
118: 2184| [45] [・Materials Engineering]
119: 2234| [45] [・Laser Engineering]
120: 2238| [45] [・Clean Energy]
121: 2242| [45] [・Nanotechnology]
122: 2292| [45] [And finally-- BC.]
123: 2448| [45] [Nuclear power and BC research in particular received copious amounts of national funding and were thus heavily pushed.]
124: 2453| [45] [Despite energy deficiencies being a global issue, no country had secured a supply of safe and high quality energy.]
125: 2457| [45] [Traditional nuclear power generation had been carried out worldwide until the early 21st century, but was no longer acceptable.]
126: 2462| [45] [Innovative results including the quick implementation of nuclear fusion were expected.]
127: 2467| [45] [And for that reason, both the government and the researchers fervently focused on nuclear power research.]
128: 2575| [45] [--BC, on the other hand, garnered focus for a completely different reason.]
129: 2580| [45] [BC research was still an extremely undeveloped field full of uncertainties in its underlying theories.]
130: 2584| [45] [But the unknown cannot be left unknown for long.]
131: 2589| [45] [It was uncertain in which ways research would progress, but it was said that the possibilities were endless.]
132: 2594| [45] [So from a scientific perspective, the secrets of BC had to be unraveled posthaste.]
133: 2709| [45] [--And to that end, both BC researchers and Communicators alike were treated favorably in this city in terms of taxation and the like.]
134: 2714| [45] [Likewise, Natsuhiko and Mashiro both were beneficiaries of such efforts.]
135: 2810| [47] [Mashiro]
136: 2813| [45] ["So do you think the number of Communicators has grown too?"]
137: 2821| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 2824| [45] ["Seems so. Though you gotta admit, this is a nice city for us to live in."]
139: 2829| [45] [Though it was a city of Communicators, the city as a whole hardly had any of the untargeted telepathy conversations that the school had.]
140: 2835| [45] [Misuse of BC was prohibited by city ordinance, with the premises of Rokumei Academy and a certain few other institutions being the only exceptions.]
141: 2840| [45] [One or two violations would go overlooked, but any intolerable misuse would soon earn you detention and reproval.]
142: 2848| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2851| [45] ["Well, I guess it's a good thing for the city to prosper. Better than being lonely, I guess."]
144: 2877| [47] [Mashiro]
145: 2880| [45] ["Yeah. I love this city too. It's a town of science and ESP. Doesn't that sound cool, like something straight out of sci-fi?"]
146: 2906| [47] [Mashiro]
147: 2909| [45] ["It's an affluent society with high public order. What more can I say?"]
148: 2917| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 2920| [45] ["Yeah... though there is one thing that bothers me."]
150: 2925| [45] [Natsuhiko gazed at the map provided at the bus stop as he spoke.]
151: 3095| [45] [Depicted at the edge of that map was a large hexagonal building.]
152: 3103| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 3106| [45] ["And what's that one thing?"]
154: 3114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 3117| [45] ["Well... to be honest, it's 'LABO'..."]
156: 3225| [45] [Right as Natsuhiko began to speak--]
157: 3249| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 3252| [45] ["...!?"]
159: 3257| [45] [He spotted something beyond the map and gasped.]
