  1:   62| [45] [The frozen image depicted three children.]
  2:   67| [45] [There was a boy with glasses and a blonde girl. They couldn't make out the face of the last one, but it appeared to be a girl as well.]
  3:   72| [45] [They were all wearing what appeared to be school uniforms.]
  4:   77| [45] [It was then that Ena and Jun both spoke at the same time.]
  5:   85| [47] [Ena]
  6:   88| [45] ["It can't be! Why are Mr. Tenkawa and the others here!?"]
  7:   96| [47] [Jun]
  8:   99| [45] ["Huh!? Then those two are Mashiro and Louise!?"]
  9:  107| [47] [Watase]
 10:  110| [45] ["Huh? The two of you know them?"]
 11:  118| [47] [Ena]
 12:  121| [45] ["Of course I do! I'm the long-term sub for their homeroom teacher."]
 13:  129| [47] [Jun]
 14:  132| [45] ["I just happened to get to know those kids last week..."]
 15:  140| [47] [Watase]
 16:  143| [45] ["What!?"]
 17:  242| [45] [Watase's surprise only furthered with Ukita's following comment.]
 18:  250| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  253| [45] ["Truth is, I'm familiar with those kids myself."]
 20:  261| [47] [Watase]
 21:  264| [45] ["How so?"]
 22:  272| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  275| [45] ["Well, not only do I live next door to that boy, but his mother happens to be one of my coworkers here. That's how."]
 24:  283| [47] [Watase]
 25:  286| [45] ["Then did they come to see his mother?"]
 26:  312| [47] [Ukita]
 27:  315| [45] ["Sorry... but I don't know the answer to that either..."]
 28:  323| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  326| [45] ["Anyway, there are several other images just like this one. And the last one--"]
 30:  352| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  355| [45] ["Was taken in Area 5 at 7:12 AM."]
 32:  360| [45] [When he heard that, Watase instantly understood what Ukita was getting at.]
 33:  368| [47] [Watase]
 34:  371| [45] ["Wait... if they were down here at 7:12 AM, and the bulkheads were lowered at 7 AM..."]
 35:  397| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  400| [45] ["Right. That means that there are at least three others aside from us who are trapped here in LABO."]
 37:  408| [47] [Watase]
 38:  411| [45] ["What...!?"]
 39:  433| [45] [Watase looked back to the image on the monitors.]
 40:  438| [47] [Watase]
 41:  439| [45] [(What were they doing here?)]
 42:  444| [45] [Did they really come here to visit the boy's mother? Or was there some other reason--]
 43:  452| [47] [Watase]
 44:  455| [45] ["Hey, Teach... what're their names?"]
 45:  464| [47] [Ena]
 46:  467| [45] ["The boy is 'Natsuhiko Tenkawa'."]
 47:  477| [47] [Ena]
 48:  480| [45] ["The two girls are 'Mashiro Toba' and 'Louise Yui Sannomiya'."]
 49:  485| [47] [Watase]
 50:  486| [45] ["..."]
 51:  491| [45] [All those names sounded vaguely familiar to him.]
 52:  496| [45] [He felt a kinship from them, like he'd known them all for a long time.]
 53:  501| [47] [Watase]
 54:  502| [45] [(Could it be...)]
 55:  507| [47] [Watase]
 56:  508| [45] [(That I went down to the basement to save these kids?)]
 57:  567| [45] [He turned to Ukita as he pondered that.]
 58:  575| [47] [Watase]
 59:  578| [45] ["Are you sure that those kids are still trapped here?"]
 60:  604| [47] [Ukita]
 61:  607| [45] ["Well, I certainly can't confirm that, but I'm pretty sure of it."]
 62:  612| [45] [Ukita pointed to a phone in the corner of the room.]
 63:  638| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  641| [45] ["The emergency phone is dead, and my PDA isn't getting any reception."]
 65:  668| [47] [Jun]
 66:  671| [45] ["We tried those both ourselves, but it didn't work out either."]
 67:  676| [45] [Ena suddenly perked her head up once she heard that.]
 68:  704| [47] [Ena]
 69:  707| [45] ["I've got an idea. Can anyone here use 'BC'?"]
 70:  715| [47] [Watase]
 71:  718| [45] ["Huh... 'Bee See'?"]
 72:  744| [47] [Ena]
 73:  747| [45] ["Right, like telepathy."]
 74:  773| [47] [Ena]
 75:  776| [45] ["If we can use that to get in contact with the outside, then I think we can learn more about what's going on."]
 76:  784| [47] [Watase]
 77:  787| [45] ["T-Telepathy...!?"]
 78:  792| [45] [Watase's eyes widened at that totally out-of-place word.]
 79:  800| [47] [Watase]
 80:  803| [45] ["Teach, how can you joke at a time like this?"]
 81:  829| [47] [Ena]
 82:  832| [45] ["Oh my, I didn't realize your amnesia was -that- bad... So you forgot about that stuff too?"]
 83:  840| [47] [Ena]
 84:  843| [45] ["People capable of using telepathy are not that uncommon these days."]
 85:  851| [47] [Watase]
 86:  854| [45] ["Wha... Are you serious!?"]
 87:  859| [45] [Watase looked at the others in total shock.]
 88:  864| [45] [But he was the only surprised one there.]
 89:  872| [47] [Watase]
 90:  875| [45] ["H-hey, Tachibana, is what she's saying true?"]
 91:  901| [47] [Kazami]
 92:  904| [45] ["Yes, it is."]
 93:  912| [47] [Kazami]
 94:  915| [45] ["The 'telepathy' she's talking about is the ability to send your voice to people in a distant place."]
 95:  941| [47] [Kazami]
 96:  944| [45] ["It's true that we'd probably be able to get in touch with people on the outside if we could use it--"]
 97:  970| [47] [Jun]
 98:  973| [45] ["But though she said it's not rare, the rate of people who can use it is still only 1 in 500."]
 99:  999| [47] [Jun]
100: 1002| [45] ["And though a lot of BC users are kids for some reason, adult BC users are as rare as a hen's teeth."]
101: 1010| [47] [Jun]
102: 1013| [45] ["Naturally, that goes for you and the rest of our squad."]
103: 1039| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1042| [45] ["You've probably guessed, but I can't use it either. What about you, Yuuri?"]
105: 1068| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1071| [45] ["I-I... can't do it. I'm bad at BC..."]
107: 1076| [45] [Everyone had answered with a serious look on their faces.]
108: 1081| [45] [It was still hard for him to believe, but after seeing their reactions, it seemed Watase had no choice but to accept it as the truth.]
109: 1089| [47] [Watase]
110: 1092| [45] ["You're all serious...? Then are there people who can use other superpowers?"]
111: 1100| [47] [Watase]
112: 1103| [45] ["Like, uh, you know, teleportation, telekinesis... stuff like that?"]
113: 1129| [47] [Ena]
114: 1132| [45] ["Of course not. That stuff's purely in the realm of the occult."]
115: 1140| [47] [Watase]
116: 1143| [45] ["And telepathy isn't?"]
117: 1169| [47] [Ena]
118: 1172| [45] ["BC is a 'power' that's been scientifically proven. There's nothing 'super' about it."]
119: 1198| [47] [Ena]
120: 1201| [45] ["BC stands for 'Beyond Communication-- a form of communication that doesn't use language as an intermediary."]
121: 1209| [47] [Ena]
122: 1212| [45] ["It is essentially the ability to mutually communicate your ideas to people far away.%NNothing more, and nothing less."]
123: 1217| [45] [It appeared that this "BC" had very limited uses.]
124: 1222| [45] [But even if what she said was true--]
125: 1230| [47] [Watase]
126: 1233| [45] ["Well, yeah, it probably would be better if we could use telepathy or whatever..."]
127: 1241| [47] [Watase]
128: 1244| [45] ["But I doubt we'd be so lucky to have anyone here who won the lottery on that whole%N'1 out of 500' deal."]
129: 1270| [47] [Ena]
130: 1273| [45] ["But those kids -can- use telepathy."]
131: 1281| [47] [Watase]
132: 1284| [45] ["Huh!? Then we could contact the surface if they were here!?"]
133: 1310| [47] [Ena]
134: 1313| [45] ["-If- they were here, that is... Ah geez, this is pathetic. Things would be so much easier if I could use it myself."]
135: 1318| [45] [Just then, Ena's words...]
136: 1330| [45] [... were cut off by the sudden sound of a voice and white noise echoing through the room.]
137: 1414| [47] [???]
138: 1417| [45] ["--his is Sirius Commander Murakami."]
139: 1422| [47] [???]
140: 1425| [45] ["Tachibana, do you read me? Over."]
141: 1433| [47] [Watase]
142: 1436| [45] ["What!?"]
143: 1571| [47] [Kazami]
144: 1574| [45] ["The radio! It looks like it's finally getting transmissions from the surface again!"]
145: 1579| [45] [Kazami took out her PDA and spoke directly into it.]
146: 1605| [47] [Kazami]
147: 1608| [45] ["Loud and clear. This is Lieutenant Tachibana of Sirius Team A."]
148: 1613| [47] [Commander]
149: 1616| [45] ["Tachibana! Looks like we finally got the radio up and running again!"]
150: 1642| [47] [Kazami]
151: 1645| [45] ["But the reception's still extremely unstable. It could cut off at any moment for all we know."]
152: 1650| [47] [Commander]
153: 1653| [45] ["Then make your report as short as possible. Give me an update on your status."]
154: 1679| [47] [Kazami]
155: 1682| [45] ["Roger. At the present, we are--"]
156: 1687| [45] [Kazami then told Commander Murakami everything that'd transpired up until that point.]
157: 1692| [45] [About how they'd reunited with Watase and then saved Yuuri, Ena, and Ukita.]
158: 1697| [45] [It appeared she was keeping Watase's amnesia a secret for now.]
159: 1702| [45] [Once Kazami had finished her report, Commander Murakami paused, then spoke again in a defeated voice.]
160: 1707| [47] [Commander]
161: 1710| [45] ["I see... so everyone in Team A really did go down to the basement."]
162: 1718| [47] [Kazami]
163: 1721| [45] ["Then you're saying that neither Dojima nor Hiyama made it to the surface?"]
164: 1726| [47] [Commander]
165: 1729| [45] ["No. It appears that the surface and basement have become completely separated."]
166: 1734| [45] [Kazami listened calmly to Commander Murakami's solemn voice before speaking again.]
167: 1760| [47] [Kazami]
168: 1763| [45] ["Incidentally, would you happen to know why the bulkheads have been lowered, sir?"]
169: 1768| [47] [Commander]
170: 1771| [45] ["Truth is, there are still a lot of things we're unclear about ourselves up here... but I have to tell you something first."]
171: 1776| [47] [Commander]
172: 1779| [45] ["The nuclear reactor in the basement has undergone a meltdown. We know this for a fact."]
173: 1787| [47] [Kazami]
174: 1790| [45] ["I knew it...!"]
175: 1796| [47] [Commander]
176: 1799| [45] ["Right after the explosions occurred at 6:19 AM, LABO's engineers began working on initiating an emergency shutdown of the reactor from the remote control room located in the surface floors."]
177: 1804| [47] [Commander]
178: 1807| [45] ["But after that, pretty much everything that could have gone wrong, did."]
179: 1812| [47] [Commander]
180: 1815| [45] ["The short-term coolant suffered a circulation malfunction, the water pressure regulators broke down, the ventilation control system went offline, and so on."]
181: 1820| [47] [Commander]
182: 1823| [45] ["The engineers did all they could to prevent a meltdown--"]
183: 1828| [47] [Commander]
184: 1831| [45] ["But unfortunately, their desperate efforts were in vain..."]
185: 1836| [47] [Kazami]
186: 1837| [45] ["..."]
187: 1842| [47] [Commander]
188: 1845| [45] ["That's also what caused the bulkheads to lock."]
189: 1851| [47] [Commander]
190: 1854| [45] ["The radiation leakage prevention system activated when the meltdown occurred."]
191: 1880| [47] [Kazami]
192: 1883| [45] ["The radiation leakage prevention system...!"]
193: 1888| [47] [Commander]
194: 1891| [45] ["Yeah, it's used to prevent the spread of radioactive material."]
195: 1917| [47] [Kazami]
196: 1920| [45] ["Then can't you simply open the bulkheads for just a few seconds?"]
197: 1925| [45] [Expectation filled the group's faces when they heard Kazami's suggestion.]
198: 1930| [45] [However--]
199: 1935| [47] [Commander]
200: 1938| [45] ["It pains me to say this..."]
201: 1943| [47] [Commander]
202: 1946| [45] ["But at the present, that's impossible...!"]
203: 1972| [47] [Kazami]
204: 1975| [45] ["Impossible!? Why is that!?"]
205: 1980| [47] [Commander]
206: 1983| [45] ["It seems that due to the meltdown, there's still a huge fire going on in Area N, which is where the reactor is located--"]
207: 1988| [47] [Commander]
208: 1991| [45] ["The security's system's gone haywire thanks to that, which means that we can no longer access it externally in theory."]
209: 1996| [47] [Commander]
210: 1999| [45] ["It seems the system will stop going haywire if the fire quells down, but since Area N's automatic sprinkler system is already broken, we can't expect that the fire will be extinguished."]
211: 2004| [47] [Commander]
212: 2007| [45] ["So LABO's staffers are currently doing everything in their power to restore the system, but..."]
213: 2033| [47] [Kazami]
214: 2036| [45] ["How long do they think that will take!?"]
215: 2041| [47] [Commander]
216: 2044| [45] ["... About..."]
217: 2049| [47] [Commander]
218: 2052| [45] ["Another nine hours."]
219: 2141| [47] [All]
220: 2144| [45] ["--!"]
221: 2149| [45] [Everyone gasped at the words "nine hours".]
222: 2175| [47] [Kazami]
223: 2178| [45] ["D... don't joke like that! Please destroy the bulkhead or open an escape route for us!"]
224: 2183| [47] [Commander]
225: 2186| [45] ["I'm really sorry, Tachibana, but I can't do that!"]
226: 2194| [47] [Kazami]
227: 2197| [45] ["Why not!? C4 should be enough to get the job done, right!?"]
228: 2202| [47] [Commander]
229: 2205| [45] ["The floors and bulkheads dividing the surface and basement are made of 8-layered thick anti-heat and shock composite steel plates! C4 won't be enough for something like that!"]
230: 2210| [47] [Commander]
231: 2213| [45] ["Those plates are designed to withstand steam and hydrogen explosions. We don't have anything nearly powerful enough..."]
232: 2239| [47] [Kazami]
233: 2242| [45] ["N-no way..."]
234: 2247| [45] [The normally composed Kazami was in total shock.]
235: 2273| [47] [Kazami]
236: 2276| [45] ["We've got multiple survivors down with us... Are you sure there's nothing you can do...!?"]
237: 2281| [47] [Commander]
238: 2284| [45] ["We're doing all we can too, but it-- ... take some ti--... o wait."]
239: 2289| [45] [Suddenly, his voice started only coming through in bursts.]
240: 2297| [47] [Kazami]
241: 2300| [45] ["Commander!? I didn't catch all of that!"]
242: 2305| [47] [Commander]
243: 2308| [45] ["...ception's unstable! --o time, I have message from LABO's staff to you!"]
244: 2313| [45] [The commander apparently realized that the transmission was reaching its limits, as he started talking much faster without pausing.]
245: 2318| [47] [Commander]
246: 2321| [45] ["--re's AD lying all around the facility for cases like this!"]
247: 2326| [47] [Commander]
248: 2329| [45] ["Keep administering it to yourselves! And stay away from contaminated zones!"]
249: 2334| [47] [Commander]
250: 2337| [45] ["--st keep doing that and you'll make it for sure!"]
251: 2342| [45] [His voice was full of grief and pain.]
252: 2347| [45] [Kazami quietly listened to him with a bitter look on her face.]
253: 2352| [47] [Commander]
254: 2355| [45] ["...--...ounting on you, Tachibana. Support Kasasagi and Moribe as m--"]
255: 2381| [47] [Kazami]
256: 2384| [45] ["Commander!? You're breaking up again!"]
257: 2389| [47] [Commander]
258: 2392| [45] ["... hear me!? The reception's going--"]
259: 2400| [47] [Kazami]
260: 2403| [45] ["Commander! Commander!"]
261: 2408| [45] [Kazami desperately called out to him--]
262: 2419| [45] [But the only reply she got was the cruel hiss of static from the radio.]
