  0:   68| [45] [--Time just seemed to fly by once Kazami had become a member of Sirius.]
  1:   73| [45] [Her life as a rescue worker provided a sense of fulfillment.]
  2:   78| [45] [What's more, though at first, she had disagreed with him how work should be handled,%NKazami made peace with Watase, and eventually grew a deep-seated respect for him.]
  3:   83| [45] [That said, they did still disagree from time to time on certain matters.]
  4:   88| [45] [This included their attitudes towards work, their readiness...]
  5:   93| [45] [And-- their thoughts on BC.]
  6:   98| [45] [When she asked him about it in a random conversation of theirs, he had this to say on the matter:]
  7:  190| [47] [Watase]
  8:  193| [45] ["BC, huh... To be honest, I'm not what you'd call a big fan of it."]
  9:  198| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  201| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 11:  206| [45] [He apparently disliked BC. When she asked why, he answered thusly:]
 12:  232| [47] [Watase]
 13:  235| [45] ["I've felt this way ever since I heard about BC for the first time when I was a kid..."]
 14:  243| [47] [Watase]
 15:  246| [45] ["But honestly, the whole idea of having your mind read just seems scary to me."]
 16:  251| [45] [That wasn't unusual for people of Watase's age, but it didn't seem like that was his only reason.]
 17:  256| [45] [Watase had a bad habit of putting a bit of a wall between himself and other people.]
 18:  261| [45] [Perhaps it had something to do with how he'd lost his parents and his sister in the Great Rokumei City Arson.]
 19:  266| [45] [At any rate, Kazami decided to avoid the topic of BC from thereon out.]
 20:  271| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  272| [45] [(It looks like it would be best to hide the fact I have aptitude from him...)]
 22:  277| [45] [That was the one thing Kazami would never tell Watase.]
 23:  367| [45] [Time then passed by without her making any big mistakes.]
 24:  372| [45] [Hard work gradually filled in the void in her heart left by the loss of her sister.]
 25:  423| [45] [Then one day, Jun, who adored Kazami, said that she was going to follow in her footsteps and aim to become a member of Sirius.]
 26:  428| [45] [Kazami was quite against the idea-- but she eventually caved in when faced with Jun's iron determination to follow through with that dream.]
 27:  433| [45] [And thus Team A's current roster was complete.]
 28:  501| [45] [--Then three and a half years after Kazami enlisted in Sirius, in the early morning of September 16--]
 29:  506| [45] [Kazami was just approaching the end of her night shift when--]
 30:  517| [45] [The ear-splitting scream of a dispatch siren screeched through the station.]
 31:  522| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have occurred in the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization."]
 32:  527| [45] [And with that ominous report--]
 33:  533| [45] [The curtain rose on the longest day of Kazami's life.]
 34:  642| [45] [Kazami and the others hurried on over to the dispatch site via helicopter after receiving the report.]
 35:  717| [45] [Team A lined up in LABO's entrance hall before Watase, who proceeded to give them instructions.]
 36:  722| [47] [Watase]
 37:  725| [45] ["Countless people are trapped in this lab as we speak!"]
 38:  730| [47] [Watase]
 39:  733| [45] ["And due to the nature of this facility, this will be no ordinary dispatch."]
 40:  738| [47] [Watase]
 41:  741| [45] ["We don't know what will happen here, nor what unforeseen circumstances await us."]
 42:  746| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  747| [45] [(This accident is indeed not ordinary. However--)]
 44:  752| [45] [She was sure that they'd be able to overcome whatever was thrown their way so long as they had Watase's leadership.]
 45:  757| [45] [He had saved her many a time over the last three and a half years.]
 46:  762| [45] [Kazami had utter confidence in his amazing effeciency, and even saw him as a hero.]
 47:  767| [45] [--And in turn, Kazami had also saved Watase many times.]
 48:  772| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama, her more experienced coworkers, were also very reliable men.]
 49:  777| [45] [The one she was worried about was the newly-enlisted Jun, but Kazami had faith in the strength of her heart.]
 50:  782| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  783| [45] [(We'll just do this like always: we'll save as many people as we can, then make it out of here with everyone in one piece.)]
 52:  788| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  789| [45] [(That's our job...!)]
 54:  861| [45] [Kazami steeled her determination, then rushed into LABO with her coworkers.]
 55:  868| [45] [--Kazami and Jun searched the surface floors.]
 56:  873| [45] [They were equipped with the minimum gear necessary-- air tanks, a rope, and an engine cutter.]
 57:  878| [45] [But during their search, they lost contact with Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama.]
 58:  883| [45] [She didn't know why, but it appeared that they'd all gone down to the basement. It wasn't long afterwards that both she and Jun discovered there were still survivors in the basement and went down there themselves.]
 59:  888| [45] [But they lost sight of said survivors, and got their protection suits damaged...]
 60:  899| [45] [On top of that, they got trapped in the basement due to the declaration of a "Case N".]
 61:  959| [47] [Automatic PA]
 62:  962| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
 63:  967| [47] [Automatic PA]
 64:  970| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
 65:  975| [47] [Automatic PA]
 66:  978| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
 67: 1095| [45] [But Kazami refused to give up and continued the rescue efforts.]
 68: 1118| [45] [By her side was Jun, the girl who had become like another sister to her.]
 69: 1184| [45] [--The two of them then found two Level 2 security cards.]
 70: 1189| [45] [They used those to search for an escape route and survivors as they put out the fires in the facility.]
 71: 1194| [45] [But they weren't able to find either. And just as they were about to finish searching Areas 2 and 1--]
 72: 1260| [47] [Jun]
 73: 1263| [45] ["... Ah! That's--"]
 74: 1268| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1271| [45] ["Is that the Captain!?"]
 76: 1276| [45] [They found Watase lying in a hallway in Area 1.]
 77: 1282| [45] [The three rescue workers then began their long and arduous battle through the facility...]
 78: 1313| [45] [--At that moment--]
 79: 1318| [45] [A floral scent suddenly wafted in from somewhere.]
 80: 1323| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1324| [45] [(The floral scent...!)]
 82: 1329| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1330| [45] [(This is it... the memories after this point were altered!)]
 84: 1335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1336| [45] [(Ms. Tachibana should go back to normal if I just repair them!)]
 86: 1399| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1402| [45] [{Hikorin... we're finally at the last one. Good luck.}]
 88: 1407| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1408| [45] [(Yeah...!)]
 90: 1413| [45] [Natsuhiko agreed, resuming memory access.]
 91: 1418| [45] [His search criterion was-- "floral-scented memories".]
