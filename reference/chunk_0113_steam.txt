  0:   60| [55] [√After Chapter 1]
  1:   64| [47] [Man]
  2:   65| [45] [(No, that's impossible...!)]
  3:   70| [45] [There was no way a drug that offered 100%% resistance to radiation actually existed.]
  4:   75| [45] [He had no memories to base that assumption off of, but he was sure he was right--]
  5:  124| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
  6:  127| [45] ["Oh yeah...! Captain, when was the last time you gave yourself some AD!?"]
  7:  135| [47] [Man]
  8:  138| [45] ["I don't know, but..."]
  9:  164| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 10:  167| [45] ["Crap! You'd better inject yourself just to be safe! You should have some AD on you!"]
 11:  212| [45] [The man searched his pockets as instructed and quickly found an ampule in one of them.]
 12:  220| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 13:  223| [45] ["Using it's a piece of cake! It comes with its own cartridge, so just put it in that--"]
 14:  270| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 15:  273| [45] ["Now all you've gotta do is break off the tip, put it against a vein, and then just press the end!"]
 16:  297| [45] [But though he'd heard her explanation quite clearly, the man didn't feel like injecting himself with it.]
 17:  323| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 18:  326| [45] ["Captain, what's wrong? Hurry up and inject it already."]
 19:  403| [45] [The man chose that moment to glance at the girl standing next to the rescue worker.]
 20:  408| [45] [The image of her turning around and trying to escape the AD injection played back in his head.]
 21:  413| [45] [He turned to the lieutenant again as the warning bells in his heart grew louder and louder.]
 22:  450| [47] [Man]
 23:  453| [45] ["Hey... is this AD really an anti-radiation drug?"]
 24:  461| [47] [Man]
 25:  464| [45] ["I just can't bring myself to believe that's true..."]
 26:  469| [45] [Irritation welled up in the lieutenant's eyes at that moment.]
 27:  495| [47] [Lieutenant]
 28:  498| [45] ["Captain, please stop fooling around! There might be radiation eating away at your body at this very second!"]
 29:  524| [47] [Lieutenant]
 30:  527| [45] ["If you can't do it, then take out your arm! I'll give you the shot!"]
 31:  613| [45] [The lieutenant then took the ampule and cartridge right out of the man's hands with those words.]
 32:  618| [45] [She then quickly loaded the ampule into the cartridge and pointed it at the man's arm.]
 33:  644| [47] [Lieutenant]
 34:  647| [45] ["--Hurry! Please give me your arm!"]
 35:  652| [45] [That same woman had injected the young girl with AD against her own will just a few minutes ago in the exact same manner.]
 36:  657| [45] [That fact put the man on his guard.]
 37:  665| [47] [Man]
 38:  668| [45] ["--Stop it! I don't need that thing!"]
 39:  755| [47] [Lieutenant]
 40:  758| [45] ["Ahh!"]
 41:  763| [45] [As he shook the AD away, his hand struck the lieutenant in the face, causing her to shriek.]
 42:  790| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 43:  793| [45] ["Whoa, what the hell are you doing, Captain!?"]
 44:  801| [47] [Man]
 45:  804| [45] ["Shut up! No more lies! Tell me what you're planning to do to me after you inject me with whatever crap's in this thing!"]
 46:  830| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 47:  833| [45] ["Huh? 'The hell are you on about? Are you saying you can't trust what your squadmates say?"]
 48:  838| [45] [It was true that the two of them were wearing the same rescue uniform that he was.]
 49:  843| [45] [But with no memories, they could just be pretending to be rescue workers for all the man knew.]
 50:  848| [45] [Just then, the lieutenant turned to her subordinate and spoke.]
 51:  874| [47] [Lieutenant]
 52:  877| [45] ["Moribe, pin the Captain down! Brute force is our only option at this point!"]
 53:  903| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 54:  906| [45] ["Roger!"]
 55:  911| [47] [Man]
 56:  912| [45] [(Wha-- I knew it, these guys are-!!)]
 57:  917| [45] [No rescue worker would ever do something like that in his mind.]
 58:  925| [47] [Man]
 59:  928| [45] ["S-stay back!"]
 60:  995| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 61:  998| [45] ["Whoa!"]
 62: 1003| [45] [The man shook off the female rescue worker and ran away from the group as fast as he could.]
 63: 1057| [45] [He then blindly ran without any clue where he was headed for a few minutes.]
 64: 1111| [45] [--After shutting the door behind him, he found himself standing in a room buried in debris.]
 65: 1116| [47] [Man]
 66: 1117| [45] [(A dead end!?)]
 67: 1122| [47] [Man]
 68: 1123| [45] [(Dammit-- this place won't work! They'll find me in no time flat!)]
 69: 1128| [45] [He looked up, only to find what appeared to be the landing of a staircase.]
 70: 1133| [45] [He then heard the voices of the two "rescue workers" on the other side of the door.]
 71: 1219| [47] [Lieutenant]
 72: 1222| [45] ["Moribe, did you find the captain?"]
 73: 1255| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 74: 1258| [45] ["Nope. No sign of him."]
 75: 1284| [47] [Lieutenant]
 76: 1287| [45] ["Then the only other place we haven't looked is..."]
 77: 1335| [47] [Man]
 78: 1336| [45] [(S-shit!)]
 79: 1384| [45] [He then brought his hands and feet to the partially collapsed wall and climbed, aiming for the landing above him.]
 80: 1389| [45] [The odds of him actually making it there seemed nigh-impossible, but--]
 81: 1410| [47] [Man]
 82: 1411| [45] [(This body... is super strong.)]
 83: 1416| [45] [By the time the two "rescue workers" opened the door, the man was only a short distance away from reaching the landing.]
 84: 1444| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 85: 1447| [45] ["Whaaaaaat!? C-Captain!?"]
 86: 1473| [47] [Lieutenant]
 87: 1476| [45] ["Wh-what in God's name do you think you're doing--!?"]
 88: 1516| [47] [Man]
 89: 1517| [45] [(Damn, they found me. But I'm almost--)]
 90: 1522| [45] [Though his attention was caught by the voices below him, the man still reached for the landing-- but at that moment--]
 91: 1548| [45] [The protruding wall he'd been using as a foothold suddenly gave way.]
 92: 1556| [47] [Man]
 93: 1559| [45] ["Huh?"]
 94: 1564| [45] [By the time he came to his senses, his body was dancing in mid-air.]
 95: 1569| [45] [And the landing that was almost in his grasp was suddenly much farther away.]
 96: 1574| [45] [--I'm falling!?]
 97: 1579| [45] [A second later, his back crashed into the debris below him.]
 98: 1675| [47] [Man]
 99: 1678| [45] ["----!"]
100: 1763| [45] [He spit out all the air in his lungs.]
101: 1768| [45] [There was an unnatural pain in his chest.]
102: 1773| [47] [Man]
103: 1774| [45] [(Wha... what the hell... is this...?)]
104: 1779| [45] [When he looked down, he saw a reinforcing bar smeared with dark red blood sticking out of the center of his chest.]
105: 1787| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
106: 1790| [45] ["Captain! Th-this can't be happening!"]
107: 1798| [47] [Lieutenant]
108: 1801| [45] ["A-AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! No! No!!"]
109: 1806| [45] [Their screams filled his ears.]
110: 1811| [45] [--Screams!?]
111: 1816| [45] [Amidst the agony he was feeling, a thought still managed to pop into the man's head.]
112: 1821| [45] ["I thought they were trying to hurt me... Then why are they screaming like that?"]
113: 1826| [47] [Man]
114: 1827| [45] [(Then... does that mean those two were...)]
115: 1832| [47] [Man]
116: 1833| [45] [(Actually... worried... about me...?)]
117: 1838| [45] [But he no longer had any time to find out if that was true or not--]
118: 1881| [45] [For before long, he passed away as blood foamed from his mouth.]
