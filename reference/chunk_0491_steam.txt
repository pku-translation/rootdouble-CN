  0:  129| [45] [--It was a memory of a distant day.]
  1:  134| [45] [The first summer break since Natsuhiko had met Yuuri--]
  2:  180| [45] [He and the others had run around town each day trying to solve the mysteries of Rokumei City's Seven Wonders.]
  3:  185| [45] [That day, Natsuhiko and Yuuri headed to the "secret base" on the outskirts of the city to hammer out their Seven Wonders solution mission.]
  4:  228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  231| [45] ["Now then, boys and girls, everyone here!? Then let's work hard on our solving those mysteries!"]
  6:  236| [45] [Natsuhiko raised his voice as he and Yuuri entered the secret base.]
  7:  241| [45] [But nobody answered.]
  8:  246| [45] [Not a single one of their friends who gathered here was present.]
  9:  254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  257| [45] ["... Wait, what? That's odd. How come nobody's here?"]
 11:  283| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  286| [45] ["Yeah, everyone was here yesterday..."]
 13:  325| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  328| [45] ["Mashiro! Richio! Sugizo! Maruichi!"]
 15:  336| [47] [Yuuri]
 16:  339| [45] ["Himecchi? Aipon? Renren?"]
 17:  344| [45] [They tried calling out their friends' nicknames, but there was still no answer.]
 18:  349| [45] [And then, Yuuri suddenly spoke up as if she had remembered something.]
 19:  377| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  380| [45] ["Oh... that's right. Today's Obon."]
 21:  388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  391| [45] ["Obon?"]
 23:  417| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  420| [45] ["Apparently, it's the day you go out to the country to visit your grandparents and stuff."]
 25:  428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  431| [45] ["Ah, that's right. Mashiro mentioned that too... She said she was going to her grandpa's house in Hokkaido today."]
 27:  436| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't have any grandparents he had to visit, so he wasn't that interested in Obon.]
 28:  462| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  465| [45] ["... Now that I think about it, Himecchi and the others said they were going to the country for summer break. So that must've started today~"]
 30:  473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  476| [45] ["Guess it's the same with Richio and the other guys... Tch, how rude. They care more about some dumb old countryside than our solution mission."]
 32:  481| [45] [Natsuhiko puffed his cheeks in frustration.]
 33:  486| [45] [Yuuri spoke up, a little bothered.]
 34:  512| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  515| [45] ["Then I guess it's just us two today, huh? What do we do, Hikorin? Should we leave the solution mission for when everyone gets back?"]
 36:  523| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  526| [45] ["Nah. Let's just do it by ourselves. Even without Mashiro and the others around, the two of us alone are more than enough."]
 38:  552| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  555| [45] ["Huh, r-really?"]
 40:  563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  566| [45] ["Well, Yuuri, you're like an older sister to us, and you read a lot of books, so you must be smart. With your brains and my muscle, I'm sure we can do anything."]
 42:  592| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  595| [45] ["Th-that's the first time anyone's ever told me that...!"]
 44:  621| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  624| [45] ["Okay, I'm pumped up now! Let's work hard on that solution mission, Hikorin!"]
 46:  706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  709| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 48:  715| [45] [The two of them raised their fists into the air as they shouted.]
 49:  811| [45] [They quickly left the secret base and spoke as they walked.]
 50:  887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  890| [45] ["Now then, Yuuri. I think we'll go investigate the fifth wonder today."]
 52:  898| [47] [Yuuri]
 53:  901| [45] ["That's the one that goes 'a Communicator who uses BC without knowing the proper way will become a mindbroken monster', right?"]
 54:  927| [47] [Yuuri]
 55:  930| [45] ["They even say that those monsters are captured by security department forces."]
 56:  938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  941| [45] ["But if that's the case, then some of those monsters gotta be around somewhere before the security department catches them."]
 58:  977| [45] [Natsuhiko said that as he took a map out of his pocket.]
 59:  982| [45] [The two children huddled together to look at it.]
 60: 1009| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1012| [45] ["If you were a monster... where do you think you'd be in this city, Yuuri?"]
 62: 1038| [47] [Yuuri]
 63: 1041| [45] ["Hmm, let's see... If I were a monster, I'd be somewhere dark and scary, maybe?"]
 64: 1067| [47] [Yuuri]
 65: 1070| [45] ["Maybe like that ruined hospital that you, me, and Mashiron went to the other day."]
 66: 1078| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1081| [45] ["I guess that's gotta be the place, huh. Even Mashiro got scared there."]
 68: 1089| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1092| [45] ["Okay, let's try going there!"]
 70: 1118| [47] [Yuuri]
 71: 1121| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 72: 1177| [45] [And with that, they headed for the ruined hospital.]
 73: 1240| [45] [It was a spooky place no matter how many times they went there.]
 74: 1245| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri walked in.]
 75: 1253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1256| [45] ["D-do you think there are monsters here too and not just ghosts...?"]
 77: 1282| [47] [Yuuri]
 78: 1285| [45] ["It'd be too spooky if there are..."]
 79: 1293| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1296| [45] ["But it's okay. If a monster comes out, then I'd knock 'em out cold with my finishing punch."]
 81: 1304| [47] [Yuuri]
 82: 1307| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 83: 1331| [45] [Natsuhiko came close to the frightened Yuuri as if to protect her.]
 84: 1336| [45] [And suddenly, Yuuri gasped.]
 85: 1364| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1367| [45] ["Ah! H-Hikorin! Somebody's there!"]
 87: 1375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1378| [45] ["What!?"]
 89: 1428| [45] [Natsuhiko readied himself, thinking that a monster had appeared.]
 90: 1454| [45] [But instead-- he saw a girl who seemed just a little bit older than them.]
 91: 1497| [47] [Older Girl]
 92: 1500| [45] ["Wah! D-don't startle me like that...!"]
 93: 1532| [47] [Older Girl]
 94: 1535| [45] ["Wh-who are you guys?"]
 95: 1543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1546| [45] ["Wh-who are -you-!? What are you doing here?"]
 97: 1572| [47] [Older Girl]
 98: 1575| [45] ["Who am -I-? Man, you're one cheeky kid."]
 99: 1601| [47] [Older Girl]
100: 1604| [45] ["I came to scope this place out for an upcoming neighborhood association test of courage. I'm not suspicious or anything."]
101: 1612| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1615| [45] ["Oh, is that all... I'm sorry for suspecting you. Miss."]
103: 1641| [47] [Older Girl]
104: 1644| [45] ["Whoa, I thought you were cheeky, but you're actually kinda well mannered for a kid, huh~? I can appreciate that."]
105: 1670| [47] [Older Girl]
106: 1673| [45] ["By the way, what is it you kids are doing here? You kids on a test of courage too?"]
107: 1681| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1684| [45] ["No, not that--"]
109: 1692| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1695| [45] ["We're searching for monsters... Have you seen any monsters here, Miss?"]
111: 1721| [47] [Older Girl]
112: 1724| [45] ["Monsters? Ah, you mean like the ones from Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, eh?"]
113: 1732| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1735| [45] ["Yes, those."]
115: 1743| [47] [Older Girl]
116: 1746| [45] ["Nah, haven't seen any. I've made a once around of this place, but haven't seen anything like monsters."]
117: 1754| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1757| [45] ["I-I see... Don't know if I'm disappointed or relieved..."]
119: 1765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1768| [45] ["Hmm, guess we missed the mark, huh."]
121: 1773| [45] [The girl smiled wryly when Natsuhiko's shoulders drooped.]
122: 1799| [47] [Older Girl]
123: 1802| [45] ["No need to feel so down. But why were you lookin' for monsters anyway?"]
124: 1810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1813| [45] ["We're trying to solve the Seven Wonders. We're on a mission to solve them with our friends."]
126: 1839| [47] [Older Girl]
127: 1842| [45] ["Hmm, that sounds kinda fun, huh?"]
128: 1850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1853| [45] ["It is fun. Want to join?"]
130: 1879| [47] [Older Girl]
131: 1882| [45] ["Hmm~... I kinda do, but Daddy said to be back by 3, so I gotta go back soon."]
132: 1890| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1893| [45] ["Aw, too bad."]
134: 1901| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1904| [45] ["That's a pity... I thought we made a new friend..."]
136: 1930| [47] [Older Girl]
137: 1933| [45] ["Well, just ask next time we meet. Bye."]
138: 1974| [45] [And with that, the girl left the ruined hospital.]
139: 1979| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri spoke with each other.]
140: 2012| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2015| [45] ["Looks like there aren't any monsters here, huh."]
142: 2023| [47] [Yuuri]
143: 2026| [45] ["Let's get out of here too... It's scary in here..."]
144: 2034| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2037| [45] ["I-I'm not scared, but yeah, let's leave."]
146: 2098| [45] [And with that, they left the ruined hospital.]
147: 2166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2169| [45] ["Where else would a monster be?"]
149: 2195| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 2198| [45] ["Hmm, if we had some sort of hint..."]
151: 2203| [45] [The two of them walked aimlessly around town.]
152: 2259| [45] [Eventually, they found themselves in front of a fire station.]
153: 2264| [45] [From the grounds, they heard a voice--]
154: 2271| [47] [???]
155: 2274| [45] ["--Seriously? You're really a monster, aren't you!?"]
156: 2279| [45] [That was what the voice said.]
157: 2302| [47] [Natsuhiko & Yuuri]
158: 2305| [45] ["!"]
159: 2329| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri quickly hid themselves out of surprise.]
160: 2334| [45] [And they heard more voices coming from the grounds.]
161: 2339| [47] [???]
162: 2342| [45] ["You broke 7 out of the 9 records during the rescue exam, right? And if that weren't enough of a surprise, you broke even more now?"]
163: 2347| [47] [???]
164: 2350| [45] ["That's why he's no longer human. He's a monster, a monster I tell ya."]
165: 2358| [47] [???]
166: 2361| [45] ["Look, guys. Don't treat someone like a monster just because of something as trivial as that."]
167: 2369| [47] [???]
168: 2372| [45] ["Besides, Dojima, you beat me in pushups and Hiyama, you came out on top in one-legged balance, right? So it's nothing really out of the norm."]
169: 2377| [47] [???]
170: 2380| [45] ["The hell it isn't! You trying to make us feel better is only pissing me off."]
171: 2385| [47] [???]
172: 2388| [45] ["Just admit how you're not human already. What planet did you come from?"]
173: 2396| [47] [???]
174: 2399| [45] ["Oh come on..."]
175: 2404| [45] [--That was the conversation they heard.]
176: 2429| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri looked at each other in astonishment.]
177: 2437| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2440| [45] ["A-a monster...? There's a monster in the fire station?"]
179: 2448| [47] [Yuuri]
180: 2451| [45] ["In a place like that...?"]
181: 2486| [45] [As they spoke, they heard a voice again.]
182: 2494| [47] [???]
183: 2497| [45] ["Anyway, let's just drop the stupid chitchat. The commander's gonna yell at us."]
184: 2528| [45] [The man came the children's way after saying that.]
185: 2533| [45] [He was a young man with scary-looking eyes.]
186: 2541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 2544| [45] ["I-is it him...?"]
188: 2552| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2555| [45] ["L-let's go find out, Hikorin..."]
190: 2563| [45] [They approached the man after saying that.]
191: 2597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2600| [45] ["E-excuse me, sir."]
193: 2626| [47] [???]
194: 2629| [45] ["Hmm? What's up, kids? Need me for anything?"]
195: 2637| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2640| [45] ["Uh, um..."]
197: 2648| [47] [Yuuri]
198: 2651| [45] ["Mister, are you a monster?"]
199: 2677| [47] [???]
200: 2680| [45] ["Wh- whaaa!?"]
201: 2685| [45] [The man widened his eyes and raised his voice hysterically.]
202: 2693| [47] [???]
203: 2696| [45] ["Wait a second, what makes you say that?"]
204: 2704| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2707| [45] ["Well, those other guys said so earlier. They said you were a monster, or that you came from another planet."]
206: 2733| [47] [???]
207: 2736| [45] ["Tch, damn Dojima and Hiyama...!"]
208: 2762| [47] [???]
209: 2765| [45] ["Listen, kids. I'm not a monster or an alien or anything like that. I'm just a average rescue worker."]
210: 2773| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 2776| [45] ["But your eyes look scary..."]
212: 2802| [47] [???]
213: 2805| [45] ["Lay off. I was born this way. Heck, what do my eyes even have to do with anything?"]
214: 2831| [47] [???]
215: 2834| [45] ["Anyway, there's no such thing as monsters. You shouldn't really call people that either, you hear?"]
216: 2842| [47] [Yuuri]
217: 2845| [45] ["Yes sir."]
218: 2853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 2856| [45] ["... Yes sir..."]
220: 2895| [45] [The man shook his head in frustration and headed for the grounds.]
221: 2900| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri took a deep breath.]
222: 2946| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 2949| [45] ["... He says there's no such thing as monsters. He doesn't know about Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, does he?"]
224: 2957| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 2960| [45] ["Guess not. Should we have told him?"]
226: 2968| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 2971| [45] ["Nah. He's kinda scary anyway."]
228: 2979| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 2982| [45] ["Anyway, where else do you think a monster could be?"]
230: 3008| [47] [Yuuri]
231: 3011| [45] ["Hmm... well, the monsters we're looking for used to be Communicators, so... maybe somewhere relating to BC...?"]
232: 3019| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3022| [45] ["Somewhere relating to BC--"]
234: 3030| [45] [Natsuhiko took out his map again. Yuuri then pointed somewhere out on the map and spoke up.]
235: 3056| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 3059| [45] ["Here! The PRC!"]
237: 3067| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 3070| [45] ["Ah, that BC research center, huh? That place is suspicious!"]
239: 3078| [47] [Yuuri]
240: 3081| [45] ["Let's go there, Hikorin!"]
241: 3142| [45] [The kids left the fire station together.]
242: 3207| [45] [But the PRC was closed.]
243: 3233| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 3236| [45] ["Hmm... We can't get in, huh... Should we try another day?"]
245: 3244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 3247| [45] ["I guess. We know this place is suspicious now, so I guess that's enough for today."]
247: 3273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 3276| [45] ["Let's bring Mashiro and the others here another day, I guess."]
249: 3302| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 3305| [45] ["Yeah!"]
251: 3344| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko and Yuuri walked off.]
252: 3352| [45] [And then they heard a voice.]
253: 3360| [47] [???]
254: 3363| [45] ["Um, excuse me...?"]
255: 3371| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 3374| [45] ["Huh?"]
257: 3421| [45] [They turned around to see an unfamiliar young lady.]
258: 3429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3432| [45] ["Can we help you, Miss?"]
260: 3459| [47] [Young Lady]
261: 3462| [45] ["Have you seen a small girl around here? She's my little sister."]
262: 3470| [47] [Young Lady]
263: 3473| [45] ["We were together just a while ago, but we got separated..."]
264: 3481| [47] [Young Lady]
265: 3484| [45] ["She's this cute girl around your age, with long hair..."]
266: 3492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 3495| [45] ["A girl? Maybe the girl we saw at the hospital?"]
268: 3521| [47] [Yuuri]
269: 3524| [45] ["But that girl was quite older than us, wasn't she?"]
270: 3532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
271: 3535| [45] ["Hmm, then I don't know... All the girls I know are off in the countryside."]
272: 3561| [47] [Young Lady]
273: 3564| [45] ["I see... Then please tell me if you do see her."]
274: 3597| [45] [The young lady staggered away on unsteady feet that made the two children worry.]
275: 3611| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 3614| [45] ["... Hmm, I'm kinda worried."]
277: 3640| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 3643| [45] ["Hikorin, why don't we help look for that girl too?"]
279: 3651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 3654| [45] ["You're right. The solution mission's important, but so's helping others."]
281: 3718| [45] [And with that, the two of them set off.]
282: 3774| [45] [They ran recklessly without a clue as to where they would find her.]
283: 3779| [45] [The only hint they had was that she was a long-haired girl around their age.]
284: 3876| [45] [They tried going to the school where Natsuhiko and Mashiro were set to enroll in next year.]
285: 3881| [45] [But they didn't see any girl like that there either.]
286: 3976| [45] [Eventually the sun started to set.]
287: 3981| [45] [But Natsuhiko and Yuuri didn't give up their search.]
288: 4038| [45] [And in the end, when they visited the park--]
289: 4043| [45] [They finally found a girl who matched the description.]
290: 4075| [47] [Long-haired Girl]
291: 4078| [45] ["Sis! Where are you~..."]
292: 4104| [47] [Long-haired Girl]
293: 4107| [45] ["It's getting dark... I'm scared..."]
294: 4135| [47] [Yuuri]
295: 4138| [45] ["Ah! Hikorin, isn't that the girl?"]
296: 4146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 4149| [45] ["Yeah! That's gotta be her!"]
298: 4175| [47] [Yuuri]
299: 4178| [45] ["Ah... but how do we tell her sister?"]
300: 4186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
301: 4189| [45] ["W-with BC?"]
302: 4215| [47] [Yuuri]
303: 4218| [45] ["Huh? But I can't use telepathy yet, remember?"]
304: 4226| [47] [Natsuhiko]
305: 4229| [45] ["Me neither... What do we do...?"]
306: 4288| [45] [As they spoke, they saw a familiar person by the park entrance.]
307: 4314| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 4317| [45] ["Ah! It's that young lady!"]
309: 4325| [47] [Yuuri]
310: 4328| [45] ["Perfect! Let's go, Hikorin!"]
311: 4333| [45] [The two of them nodded and ran off to her.]
312: 4361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
313: 4364| [45] ["Miss!!"]
314: 4390| [47] [Young Lady]
315: 4393| [45] ["Oh, you kids!?"]
316: 4401| [47] [Yuuri]
317: 4404| [45] ["We found the girl you're looking for! Look, she's over there!"]
318: 4430| [47] [Young Lady]
319: 4433| [45] ["Ah... N-Nagisa!"]
320: 4472| [45] [The young lady said that name and immediately ran over to that girl.]
321: 4477| [45] [The girl noticed her older sister and spoke up too.]
322: 4545| [47] [Nagisa]
323: 4548| [45] ["Ah, Sis!"]
324: 4574| [47] [Young Lady]
325: 4577| [45] ["Nagisa, I was so worried! Where did you go!?"]
326: 4603| [47] [Nagisa]
327: 4606| [45] ["I'm sorry~ ... I saw a helicopter flying, so I went chasing after it and got lost..."]
328: 4614| [47] [Young Lady]
329: 4617| [45] ["Geez! Don't go off without telling me again, okay?"]
330: 4625| [47] [Nagisa]
331: 4628| [45] ["Okay..."]
332: 4633| [45] [The sisters hugged each other after that.]
333: 4638| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri smiled as they watched.]
334: 4692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
335: 4695| [45] ["Good, case closed."]
336: 4703| [47] [Yuuri]
337: 4706| [45] ["Yeah. I'm so glad~"]
338: 4714| [47] [Natsuhiko]
339: 4717| [45] ["Now then, it's getting dark, so how about we head home too?"]
340: 4743| [47] [Yuuri]
341: 4746| [45] ["Huh? But shouldn't we say something to them?"]
342: 4754| [47] [Natsuhiko]
343: 4757| [45] ["After you do a good deed, you leave without saying anything. It's cooler that way."]
344: 4783| [47] [Yuuri]
345: 4786| [45] ["R-really? Then let's go with that."]
346: 4811| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko and Yuuri left the park.]
347: 4912| [45] [It was completely dark by the time they got back.]
348: 4917| [45] [They walked hand in hand under the starlight.]
349: 4943| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 4946| [45] ["--Yuuri, today was a good day, wasn't it? We advanced our mission and helped people too."]
351: 4954| [47] [Yuuri]
352: 4957| [45] ["You're right. Our solution mission was pretty good even with just the two of us, huh?"]
353: 4965| [47] [Natsuhiko]
354: 4968| [45] ["Let's work hard on our solution mission again tomorrow!"]
355: 4994| [47] [Yuuri]
356: 4997| [45] ["Yeah!"]
357: 5002| [45] [Yuuri said that with a smile.]
358: 5007| [45] [Seeing her pure, bright smile made Natsuhiko kind of happy too, so he smiled back.]
359: 5031| [45] [--Summer break wasn't over yet. Their adventure would continue tomorrow, and the next day too.]
360: 5036| [45] [Each of those precious memories would be etched into Natsuhiko's mind.]
361: 5041| [45] [Along with Yuuri's smile...]
362: 5236| [45] [--As I go back through his memories--]
363: 5241| [45] [A certain lump of information energy rises up from some corner of Natsuhiko's brain.]
364: 5246| [45] [That energy then takes form...]
365: 5251| [45] [And manifests as information in Natsuhiko's unconscious mind.]
