  0:   46| [55] [√Before Chapter 7]
  1:   61| [45] [--It was a memory Natsuhiko had sealed away in the deepest depths of his mind.]
  2:   69| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   72| [45] ["H... huh...!?"]
  4:   77| [45] [His voice spilled out of his lips on its own.]
  5:   82| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:   83| [45] [(Yuuri... died back then...!?)]
  7:   88| [45] [The moment the memory came back, he recalled each and every truth tied to it.]
  8:   93| [45] [How Yuuri's funeral service went about quietly.]
  9:   98| [45] [How Natsuhiko was unable to attend.]
 10:  103| [45] [And how Yuuri's parents did not die in a traffic accident at all. Rather, they took advantage of their daughter's death to move out of the city--]
 11:  146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  147| [45] [(... Then...)]
 13:  152| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered.]
 14:  157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  158| [45] [(In that case, who's the Yuuri standing right there--?)]
 16:  202| [45] [He timidly looked up.]
 17:  207| [45] [He tried to look at Yuuri, who he knew was standing in front of him.]
 18:  212| [45] [But as she stood there, her body--]
 19:  364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  367| [45] ["----...!!"]
 21:  397| [45] [--was faint and hazy.]
 22:  414| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  417| [45] ["... Yuuri."]
 24:  422| [45] [He called her name.]
 25:  427| [45] [In response, Yuuri just looked at him sadly-- and murmured.]
 26:  435| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  438| [45] ["Now you understand why I said I couldn't go with you, don't you...?"]
 28:  446| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  449| [45] ["...!"]
 30:  454| [45] [That very moment, the facade Natsuhiko had believed to be the truth started crumbling down.]
 31:  462| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  465| [45] ["... No..."]
 33:  568| [45] [His mind suddenly recalled words he had once heard.]
 34:  576| [47] [Salyu]
 35:  579| [45] ["The brain at times believes that hallucinations are real."]
 36:  605| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  608| [45] ["Since the hallucination 'exists' to that person, they feel no fear nor doubt."]
 38:  616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  619| [45] ["Even though it's a hallucination...?"]
 40:  645| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  648| [45] ["Even though it's a hallucination."]
 42:  707| [45] ["Hallucination."]
 43:  712| [45] [That word reverberated in his head.]
 44:  717| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  718| [45] [(Impossible...! There's no way Yuuri can be a hallucination...!)]
 46:  723| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  724| [45] [(She's been with me these nine years!!)]
 48:  729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  730| [45] [(I swear she was with me!!)]
 50:  735| [45] [Shock and confusion commanded Natsuhiko's thought process.]
 51:  740| [45] [But-- the more he thought about it, the more tell-tale signs he found.]
 52:  833| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N]
 53:  836| [45] ["PTSD Symptoms--]
 54:  839| [45] [ Repeated nightmares and flashbacks of past experiences.]
 55:  842| [45] [ Tendency to avoid things related to the cause of trauma.]
 56:  845| [45] [ Finally, panic disorders related to said trauma--"]
 57:  871| [45] [Each of those symptoms applied to Natsuhiko.]
 58:  876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  877| [45] [(H-hold on...)]
 60:  882| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  883| [45] [(... Have I always had it backwards?)]
 62:  888| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  889| [45] [(The one who lost their emotional balance after the accident wasn't Yuuri--!)]
 64:  947| [45] [A few days ago, he had this conversation with Yuuri over the phone:]
 65:  952| [45] ["How can you even tell?"%N"Because those were the words you were wishing for."]
 66:  957| [45] [At the time, he had thought Yuuri used empathy.]
 67:  962| [45] [But she never needed to read his mind at all.]
 68:  967| [45] [Because Yuuri only existed in Natsuhiko's mind to begin with...!]
 69: 1073| [45] [That was why whenever Yuuri talked to Salyu--]
 70: 1081| [47] [Yuuri]
 71: 1084| [45] ["What about you, Salyu? I've heard that manga and anime are popular in France."]
 72: 1162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1165| [45] ["True. So what about you, Salyu?"]
 74: 1191| [47] [Salyu]
 75: 1194| [45] ["Huh?"]
 76: 1199| [45] [Salyu always asked for a repeat of what Yuuri said.]
 77: 1204| [45] [It wasn't simply because she didn't hear Yuuri.]
 78: 1209| [45] [It was because Yuuri's voice could only be heard in Natsuhiko's mind.]
 79: 1268| [45] [--The reason Yuuri couldn't leave the house was because Natsuhiko wished it so.]
 80: 1273| [45] [Because it would be inconvenient to him if "Yuuri" were to attract outside attention.]
 81: 1278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1279| [45] [("The brain actively works to rationalize its perceptions to eliminate inconsistencies"...!)]
 83: 1284| [45] [Natsuhiko's perceptions were held up by countless rationalizations.]
 84: 1330| [45] [The reason Yuuri couldn't cook was because she didn't exist.]
 85: 1335| [45] [The reason Natsuhiko felt no sexual desire for Yuuri was because he couldn't touch her.]
 86: 1340| [45] [And yet he kept believing Yuuri was there, all these nine years...]
 87: 1345| [45] [Because he was unable to accept her death.]
 88: 1389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1390| [45] [(... Does that mean...)]
 90: 1395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1396| [45] [(Yuuri is gone...?)]
 92: 1401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1402| [45] [(Does that mean she's been dead for ages...!?)]
 94: 1407| [45] [The truth gradually sank into Natsuhiko's mind.]
 95: 1454| [45] [His memories rewound.]
 96: 1459| [45] [He recalled all the memories he shared with Yuuri up until today.]
 97: 1464| [45] [And all the scenes she was in--]
 98: 1525| [45] [--were replaced with the correct scenes.]
 99: 1533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1536| [45] ["... Ah..."]
101: 1626| [45] [His memories of the past hour were replaced with the truth.]
102: 1634| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1637| [45] ["Well, I'm surprised too-- but Yuuri's here in the facility."]
104: 1678| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1681| [45] ["Huh!?"]
106: 1753| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu looked around in shock.]
107: 1812| [45] [Yuuri--]
108: 1861| [45] [--was nowhere to be seen.]
109: 1866| [45] [There was nothing but air where Natsuhiko thought Yuuri was standing.]
110: 1972| [45] [And thus, the illusion manufactured by Natsuhiko's mind disappeared from his memory.]
111: 2078| [45] [The fabrication he believed in collapsed.]
112: 2186| [45] [Leaving only the truth from which Natsuhiko had always averted his eyes.]
113: 2290| [45] [The truth that Yuuri was gone--]
114: 2345| [45] [And it wasn't only the illusions in his memory. The illusion before his very eyes was also fading in favor of the truth.]
115: 2350| [45] [The fading illusion gazed at Natsuhiko and whispered.]
116: 2398| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 2401| [45] ["... Hikorin, it's time to say goodbye."]
118: 2406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 2407| [45] ["--"]
120: 2412| [45] ["Wait. Don't go."]
121: 2417| [45] [He tried to speak.]
122: 2422| [45] [But his voice wouldn't come out. He couldn't even find the words.]
123: 2430| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2433| [45] ["... I'm sorry for deceiving you for so long."]
125: 2441| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 2444| [45] ["I wanted to support you..."]
127: 2449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 2450| [45] ["..."]
129: 2458| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 2461| [45] ["... But I'm sure you'll be okay without me now."]
131: 2469| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 2472| [45] ["You've noticed it these past few days, haven't you? You're not alone, Hikorin."]
133: 2480| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 2483| [45] ["With Mashiron at your side, and Salyu too... You've overcome everything that's come your way, haven't you?"]
135: 2491| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 2494| [45] ["The professor's always thinking about you too."]
137: 2502| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 2505| [45] ["No matter how harsh the truth might be, there are plenty of people there to support you."]
139: 2513| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 2516| [45] ["... You see, that's the final thing I wanted to tell you."]
141: 2521| [45] [Perhaps that was why Natsuhiko recalled his memories again and again.]
142: 2526| [45] [To etch into his mind just how important Mashiro, Salyu, and everyone else were to him.]
143: 2531| [45] [So he'd be able to handle the truth.]
144: 2536| [45] [To correct the inconsistencies of his perception, little by little--]
145: 2583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2584| [45] [(... That's right. Whenever I tried to reject Mashiro and Salyu... premonitions of disastrous futures would come to mind.)]
147: 2589| [45] [Were those premonitions merely illusions made subconsciously by Natsuhiko's mind as a warning?]
148: 2594| [45] [Did his subconscious know that if he were to continue rejecting Mashiro and Salyu, he would be unable to stand up to the truth...?]
149: 2645| [45] [But none of that mattered to him anymore.]
150: 2650| [45] [Natsuhiko reached out to Yuuri and raised his voice.]
151: 2658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2661| [45] ["Please don't go, Yuuri!"]
153: 2669| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2672| [45] ["Huh...?"]
155: 2680| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2683| [45] ["The days I spent with you are irreplaceable!"]
157: 2691| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2694| [45] ["I don't care if you're an illusion!"]
159: 2702| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2705| [45] ["Don't disappear! I'm begging you!"]
161: 2710| [45] [Yuuri sadly responded to his cries.]
162: 2758| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 2761| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Hikorin. But I have to."]
164: 2769| [47] [Yuuri]
165: 2772| [45] ["Because you've noticed the fact that I'm gone..."]
166: 2780| [47] [Yuuri]
167: 2783| [45] ["But because of that, time has finally started to move again for you after it's been stopped for nine years, hasn't it?"]
168: 2791| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 2794| [45] ["You can live again now. You can live your own life, no longer bound by your memory of me..."]
170: 2802| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2805| [45] ["..."]
172: 2813| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 2816| [45] ["So..."]
174: 2821| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 2822| [45] ["..."]
176: 2827| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 2828| [45] ["..."]
178: 2909| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
179: 2913| [47] [--Goodbye--]
180: 3115| [45] [--Yuuri's voice stopped there.]
181: 3120| [45] [That was her final word.]
182: 3125| [45] [For she had disappeared.]
183: 3130| [45] [For the illusion vanished before Natsuhiko's eyes--!]
184: 3138| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 3141| [45] ["... Ah..."]
186: 3149| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 3152| [45] ["... Ugh, aah...."]
188: 3157| [45] [Eventually, a strangled cry escaped from Natsuhiko's throat.]
189: 3165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 3168| [45] ["--AaaaaAAAAAGGHH!!"]
191: 3173| [45] [It was the same scream he let out when he learned of Yuuri's death.]
192: 3178| [45] [The bitter cry of one who had learned the truth.]
