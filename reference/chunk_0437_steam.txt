  0:   65| [45] [--It was a memory of just about a week ago.]
  1:   70| [45] [The sights of the morning of September 10 float before my eyes.]
  2:  105| [47] [Mashiro]
  3:  108| [45] ["Hmmhmmhmm~"]
  4:  113| [45] [Mashiro was making breakfast in the Tenkawa kitchen as usual.]
  5:  124| [45] [And soon enough, she heard the living room door open as Natsuhiko greeted her.]
  6:  157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  160| [45] ["Good morning."]
  8:  165| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  168| [45] ["Ah, good morning!"]
 10:  227| [45] [Mashiro returned the greeting and quickly continued cooking.]
 11:  232| [45] [The newscaster on TV was rambling on in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.]
 12:  237| [47] [Newscaster]
 13:  240| [45] ["--Next on the news."]
 14:  245| [47] [Newscaster]
 15:  248| [45] ["Early this morning, Rokumei City's 'BC Training Center' received objectionable literature from an extremist group."]
 16:  253| [47] [Newscaster]
 17:  256| [45] ["A connection to the recently held BC seminar was also identified. The police are now working with the city security department to--"]
 18:  267| [45] [Soon, she heard Natsuhiko's voice mix in with the voice on the TV.]
 19:  275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  278| [45] ["Good morning, Yuuri."]
 21:  283| [45] [Mashiro turned around.]
 22:  288| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  291| [45] ["Good morning, Yuuri!"]
 24:  345| [45] [But of course, nobody was there.]
 25:  350| [45] [But Natsuhiko acknowledged that "Yuuri had entered the room".]
 26:  355| [45] [Mashiro merely played along.]
 27:  408| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  411| [45] ["Breakfast is just about done~"]
 29:  416| [45] [Mashiro distributed the food to Natsuhiko and "Yuuri" without any panic in particular.]
 30:  421| [45] [Over the course of the past half year, Mashiro had completely gotten the hang of things.]
 31:  447| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  450| [45] ["What's on the menu today?"]
 33:  455| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  458| [45] ["Hash browns, bacon and eggs, salad, omelettes, and orange juice."]
 35:  463| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  466| [45] ["A classic all-American breakfast."]
 37:  492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  495| [45] ["Wow, starting the day off with a full meal, huh."]
 39:  500| [45] [--During that exchange, Natsuhiko was probably hearing Yuuri's voice.]
 40:  505| [45] [Even at this point in time, he still had not accepted her death.]
 41:  550| [45] [He didn't just hear her voice.]
 42:  555| [45] [He always seemed to see an illusion of Yuuri.]
 43:  561| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  562| [45] [("Charles Bonnet syndrome", huh...)]
 45:  567| [45] [Mashiro remembered the name of a condition she had read in a book before.]
 46:  572| [45] [Charles Bonnet syndrome-- a general term for a phenomenon that occurs due to an abnormality of information transfer in the brain.]
 47:  577| [45] [Even if the person is mentally normal, they suffer symptoms including visual hallucinations.]
 48:  582| [45] [Often the cause is physical trauma to the brain.]
 49:  587| [45] [When Natsuhiko got caught in the fire, he likely inhaled large volumes of carbon monoxide.]
 50:  592| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  593| [45] [(... I guess that damaged his brain and caused him to hallucinate.)]
 52:  598| [45] [That was what Mashiro figured.]
 53:  607| [45] [--But aside from that one detail, Natsuhiko was completely normal.]
 54:  612| [45] [As long as he didn't come in contact with the truth of that past, he would live calm, peaceful days.]
 55:  706| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  709| [45] ["Now, then, boys and girls. Put your hands together--"]
 57:  717| [47] [Both]
 58:  720| [45] ["Thanks for the food~"]
 59:  725| [45] [And thus another morning began.]
 60:  730| [45] [Mashiro secretly used empathy on Natsuhiko.]
 61:  735| [45] [Upon which she heard Yuuri's voice as Natsuhiko heard it in his brain.]
 62:  740| [47] [Yuuri]
 63:  743| [45] [{Yup~ it's delicious~ Just like you'd expect from Mashiron~}]
 64:  769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  772| [45] ["Yeah, it's amazing how you can make all of this in such a short amount of time."]
 66:  777| [45] [Oddly enough, using empathy on Natsuhiko allowed Mashiro to hear Yuuri's voice as Natsuhiko heard it.]
 67:  782| [45] [Mashiro smiled at Natsuhiko.]
 68:  787| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  790| [45] ["Hahah, I'm just used to it. I mean, I -have- been doing this for over half a year now."]
 70:  903| [47] [Mashiro]
 71:  904| [45] [(... Yeah. I am used to it. I've been doing this for years...)]
 72:  909| [45] [--It took five years to train herself to that level of ability.]
 73:  914| [45] [At this point in time, Mashiro had gained the equivalent of Ability Level 5.]
 74:  919| [45] [She was able to use empathy smoothly and naturally, without the need to concentrate too hard nor the need to sacrifice her hearing.]
 75:  924| [45] [There were likely very few Communicators with the same level of ability as her in the entire nation.]
 76:  929| [45] [The reason Mashiro was able to obtain such power despite only having Rank B Aptitude--]
 77:  934| [45] [--was perhaps out of sheer force of will.]
 78:  939| [45] [Her will to "know" Natsuhiko's mind.]
 79:  944| [45] [That was what granted her ability beyond her aptitude.]
 80: 1037| [45] [Empathy allowed her a glimpse of Natsuhiko's world whenever she wished.]
 81: 1042| [47] [Yuuri]
 82: 1045| [45] [{Huh? Hikorin, you've barely touched your food. Does your tummy hurt?}]
 83: 1071| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1074| [45] ["Ah, no, I'm fine. I just wanted to savor the food as I ate."]
 85: 1079| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1082| [45] [{Really? That's good.}]
 87: 1090| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1093| [45] ["... I might not look it, but I've got a sturdy body. I've always got a healthy appetite."]
 89: 1098| [45] [With that answer, Natsuhiko stuffed his cheeks with bread.]
 90: 1103| [47] [Mashiro]
 91: 1106| [45] ["Oh, I like how you eat, Natsuhiko. Makes all that effort worth it."]
 92: 1111| [45] [The conversation concluded without any issue.]
 93: 1116| [45] [Yuuri certainly still existed, at least within the walls of the house.]
 94: 1121| [45] [Even if her existence was a fragile illusion built upon the foundation of countless lies.]
 95: 1166| [45] [Naturally, Mashiro was unbearably reluctant to peek into Natsuhiko's mind without permission.]
 96: 1171| [45] [But she chose to play along with Natsuhiko's story even if it meant she had to overcome her guilty conscience.]
 97: 1176| [45] [For that was the only way she could remain by his side.]
 98: 1181| [45] [Nine years ago, she took an oath upon herself.]
 99: 1186| [45] [To "watch over Natsuhiko until he returned to his old self".]
100: 1191| [45] [Mashiro stayed true to that oath even now.]
101: 1262| [45] [Hallucinations weren't Natsuhiko's only issues.]
102: 1267| [45] [The more serious matter at hand was his panic disorder.]
103: 1272| [45] [One wrong move and Natsuhiko would come close to noticing Yuuri's death--]
104: 1277| [45] [Causing him to display symptoms including intense headaches and heart palpitations. In extreme cases, his memories would go into disarray and he'd begin to ignore reality.]
105: 1282| [45] [Aside from hospital staff, only Mashiro and Dr. Tenkawa knew about his condition.]
106: 1287| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1288| [45] [(... If only he could gradually improve...)]
108: 1293| [45] [The most effective treatment for this kind of condition was said to be "family therapy"-- that is, for the family to treat the patient with devoted support for their condition.]
109: 1298| [47] [Mashiro]
110: 1299| [45] [(... I have to play the role of family in the professor's place...)]
111: 1304| [45] [That was what Dr. Tenkawa had requested due to her frequent absence from home.]
112: 1415| [45] [--Natsuhiko spoke apologetically to Mashiro despite having been left in the dark.]
113: 1423| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1426| [45] ["But still... sorry for making you do this all the time, Mashiro."]
115: 1431| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1434| [45] ["Whaddaya mean? Your mother pays me after all, so it's kinda like a part-time job."]
117: 1439| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1442| [45] ["And besides, it's not like I do it for you or anything. If I had to say, I do it more for Yuuri.%NRight, Yuuri?"]
119: 1465| [45] [As Mashiro said that, she secretly thought to herself.]
120: 1516| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1517| [45] [(I do it for Yuuri, huh...)]
122: 1522| [45] [Mashiro did indeed suffer a deep wound after losing her close friend.]
123: 1527| [45] [She was honestly happy that she could still talk to the deceased Yuuri by using empathy on Natsuhiko.]
124: 1532| [45] [But naturally, that couldn't have been her only reason.]
125: 1537| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 1538| [45] [(Then what have all these nine years been for...?)]
127: 1623| [45] [--She had a faint idea of the real reason.]
128: 1628| [45] [But she felt that accepting that reason would mean betraying Yuuri's memory--...]
129: 1633| [45] [And that was why Mashiro would not think about it.]
130: 1638| [45] [So she took care to only touch upon harmless and inoffensive topics when talking with Natsuhiko.]
131: 1643| [47] [Mashiro]
132: 1646| [45] ["... Does it taste good, Natsuhiko?"]
133: 1672| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1675| [45] ["Hmm? Yeah, it's good."]
135: 1680| [47] [Mashiro]
136: 1683| [45] ["Oh, glad to hear it."]
137: 1688| [45] [It was just a casual, simple conversation.]
138: 1693| [45] [But for Mashiro, it was good enough for now...]
139: 1701| [45] [Not even Mashiro quite knew herself.]
140: 1706| [45] [It couldn't be explained simply by the words "atonement" or "regret".]
141: 1711| [47] [Mashiro]
142: 1712| [45] [(... No, I just...)]
143: 1717| [47] [Mashiro]
144: 1718| [45] [(I just want Natsuhiko to return to how he used to be. That's all.)]
145: 1723| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 1724| [45] [(Because that's just about all I can do...)]
147: 1729| [45] [As Mashiro silently recited her convictions, she looked at Natsuhiko.]
148: 1734| [45] [At the boy who gazed at the phantom of a dead girl without ever second guessing himself--]
149: 1941| [45] [--Perhaps some parts of those memories didn't actually happen.]
150: 1946| [45] [Were the true events how Natsuhiko remembered them...]
151: 1951| [45] [Or what I just now saw of how Mashiro remembered them...?]
152: 1956| [45] [There's no longer any way to know for sure.]
153: 1961| [45] [But a new memory of Mashiro's floats now before me--]
154: 1966| [45] [A memory she had locked away alongside her intense feelings for Natsuhiko...]
