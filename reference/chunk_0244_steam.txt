  1:  187| [45] [--The fire was masterfully extinguished through the skillful efforts of the two rescue workers.]
  2:  213| [47] [Jun]
  3:  216| [45] ["Don't worry miss, you're safe now."]
  4:  242| [47] [Lieutenant]
  5:  245| [45] ["Are you hurt?"]
  6:  273| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  276| [45] ["... N-no."]
  8:  281| [45] [Natsuhiko looked long and hard at the girl through the man's eyes.]
  9:  385| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  386| [45] [(I-is that really Yuuri...?)]
 11:  391| [45] [But Yuuri was supposed to have died nine years ago.]
 12:  396| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  397| [45] [(Yuuri... didn't have a twin sister by any chance, did she...?)]
 14:  402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  403| [45] [(No, I could've sworn Yuuri was an only child... So could she be her clone or something, then!?)]
 16:  408| [45] [She was such a spitting image of Yuuri that he couldn't help but ponder such absurd impossibilities.]
 17:  413| [45] [At that time, the man's eyes turned toward the two rescue workers.]
 18:  457| [47] [Watase]
 19:  460| [45] ["By the way, can I ask you guys a question?"]
 20:  468| [47] [Watase]
 21:  471| [45] ["You've been calling me 'Captain'... so does that mean I'm the captain of a rescue squad or something?"]
 22:  497| [47] [Jun]
 23:  500| [45] ["Huh? The heck you talking about?"]
 24:  526| [47] [Lieutenant]
 25:  529| [45] ["What... do you mean by that?"]
 26:  537| [47] [Watase]
 27:  540| [45] ["Well, the thing is... I don't know anything."]
 28:  548| [47] [Watase]
 29:  551| [45] ["Not who I am, or even where I am..."]
 30:  608| [47] [All 3]
 31:  611| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 32:  616| [45] [Everyone on the outside was shocked by the man's confession, but Natsuhiko was rather relieved.]
 33:  621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  622| [45] [(Thank goodness... I successfully destroyed the man's mind.)]
 35:  627| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled what'd happened back then.]
 36:  701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  702| [45] [(--Show me all the memories that compose his mind!)]
 38:  707| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  708| [45] [(Please... work...)]
 40:  774| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  777| [45] [{Shatter!!}]
 42:  836| [47] [Watase]
 43:  839| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
 44:  959| [45] [That was Natsuhiko's memory of just before he had lost consciousness.]
 45:  964| [45] [It was more accurate to say that he had destroyed the man's "memories" rather than his "mind".]
 46:  969| [45] [As a result, the man appeared to be suffering from amnesia.]
 47:  974| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  975| [45] [(Then did his hatred and murderous intent disappear too...?)]
 49:  980| [45] [He had no evidence that said that much, but all signs of the man's demeanor suggested that Natsuhiko could relax for now.]
 50:  985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  986| [45] [(... But...)]
 52:  991| [45] [Natsuhiko grew depressed as he recalled the details of his own loss of consciousness.]
 53:  996| [45] [His blood loss. His senses fading into darkness. He was by no means okay.]
 54: 1001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1002| [45] [(Well, it's no wonder... With that many gunshot wounds, anybody would...)]
 56: 1060| [45] [--Anybody would die like I did back there--]
 57: 1065| [45] [That fact cast a dark shadow on Natsuhiko's mind.]
 58: 1070| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1071| [45] [(But then what am I now...?)]
 60: 1076| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1077| [45] [(... Don't tell me I'm a "ghost"...)]
 62: 1082| [45] [As that possibility crossed his mind, he recalled a story he had heard just the other day.]
 63: 1169| [47] [Ena]
 64: 1172| [45] ["In an extreme example, some people are even considering the possibility that 'ghosts' just might be another type of BC."]
 65: 1180| [47] [Ena]
 66: 1183| [45] ["BC energy created by telepathy starts decaying after it's sent, but it's not like it fades to zero immediately."]
 67: 1209| [47] [Ena]
 68: 1212| [45] ["So in other words, with or without a target, extraordinarily strong BC can remain in place for a while..."]
 69: 1273| [47] [Mashiro]
 70: 1276| [45] ["... that also means that the feelings of the dead remain in this world, doesn't it!?"]
 71: 1412| [45] [... Natsuhiko likely died while he was still inside the man's mind.]
 72: 1417| [45] [And thus the BC energy Natsuhiko used was still lingering inside the man--]
 73: 1422| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 1423| [45] [(... So my consciousness is in here now, huh.)]
 75: 1428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1429| [45] [(Who would've thought that I'd personally experience a hypothetical we discussed in class...)]
 77: 1434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1435| [45] [(It's almost like I've become an impure spirit, haunting the one who killed me... hahah.)]
 79: 1440| [45] [He was unbearably sad that he would no longer be able to see Mashiro, Salyu, or even his own mother again.]
 80: 1450| [45] [--At that moment, Natsuhiko suddenly noticed that the lieutenant was trying to inject the girl with something.]
 81: 1464| [47] [Lieutenant]
 82: 1467| [45] ["Please hold out your arm."]
 83: 1493| [47] [Yuuri]
 84: 1496| [45] ["N-no... I don't want that shot..."]
 85: 1522| [47] [Lieutenant]
 86: 1525| [45] ["You can't be like that! You'll be in grave danger without it!"]
 87: 1557| [47] [Yuuri]
 88: 1560| [45] ["Aah...!"]
 89: 1565| [45] [The lieutenant forcefully injected the girl.]
 90: 1618| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1621| [45] ["... What's that drug?"]
 92: 1647| [47] [Lieutenant]
 93: 1650| [45] ["It's called AD. Put in simple terms, it's an 'anti-radiation' drug."]
 94: 1655| [45] [According to the lieutenant's explanation:]
 95: 1787| [45] [AD was a drug provided by LABO that would serve as protection against certain levels of radiation for about 60 minutes.]
 96: 1847| [45] [Furthermore, LABO also provided the rescue squad members with radiation measurement devices known as "Procyons", which the squad apparently carried as they conducted their relief efforts.]
 97: 1903| [45] [And during the lieutenant's explanation, she told the man this:]
 98: 1911| [47] [Lieutenant]
 99: 1914| [45] ["And nearly two hours ago, that very same reactor-- went through a 'meltdown'."]
100: 2001| [45] [That revelation gave both the man and Natsuhiko a great shock.]
101: 2006| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 2007| [45] [(No... In the end, the meltdown still happened...!?)]
103: 2012| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 2013| [45] [(Dammit! I thought things would work out if I just defeated this bastard!)]
105: 2018| [45] [The man's comrades probably blew up the nuclear reactor.]
106: 2023| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 2024| [45] [(Then what have I... What have we been fighting for...?)]
108: 2039| [45] [As Natsuhiko wallowed in his helplessness, the man checked his own pockets.]
109: 2044| [45] [He then found a single ampule of AD.]
110: 2091| [47] [Jun]
111: 2094| [45] ["Using it's a piece of cake! It comes with its own cartridge, so just put it in that--"]
112: 2141| [47] [Jun]
113: 2144| [45] ["Now all you've gotta do is break off the tip, put it against a vein, and then just press the end!"]
114: 2156| [45] [The man administered the medicine as told--]
115: 2280| [45] [and a sudden change occured in Natsuhiko's consciousness.]
116: 2360| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 2361| [45] [(!?)]
118: 2413| [45] [He was struck with an abrupt, intense feeling of loss.]
119: 2429| [45] [The same sensation he felt after he fought with the man-- the sensation that he was fading away!]
120: 2445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2446| [45] [(Wh-what is this!?)]
122: 2462| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 2463| [45] [(Am I going to disappear just like this!?)]
124: 2479| [45] [His five senses rapidly faded into the distance.]
125: 2529| [45] [Death soundlessly drew near for the second time that day.]
126: 2543| [45] [And that's when Natsuhiko prayed from the bottom of his heart.]
127: 2587| [45] [That until he could confirm Mashiro's and Salyu's safety,]
128: 2641| [45] [until he could discern that girl's true identity...]
129: 2655| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 2656| [45] [(Don't... don't let me... disappear...!!)]
131: 2670| [45] [But that prayer was in vain--]
132: 2684| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness was buried in the darkness.]
