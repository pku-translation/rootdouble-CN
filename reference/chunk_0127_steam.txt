  1:  131| [47] [Kazami]
  2:  134| [45] ["Ghh!"]
  3:  196| [47] [Watase]
  4:  199| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
  5:  204| [45] [Watase was struck speechless by what he was seeing.]
  6:  209| [45] [Salyu's slender arms were wrapped around Kazami's neck like a snake strangling its prey--!]
  7:  217| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  220| [45] ["Ack, aaah..."]
  9:  225| [45] [Kazami gasped painfully for air as Salyu glared at Watase from behind her.]
 10:  233| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  236| [45] ["Release Natsuhiko. Or else I'll choke this woman to death."]
 12:  244| [47] [Watase]
 13:  247| [45] ["Stop it, Salyu!"]
 14:  255| [47] [Watase]
 15:  258| [45] ["We're just trying to save you guys! Why can't you understand that!?"]
 16:  266| [47] [Salyu]
 17:  269| [45] ["I thought I told you to stop telling such transparent lies."]
 18:  277| [47] [Salyu]
 19:  280| [45] ["You think you can trick me after you shot Natsuhiko?"]
 20:  294| [47] [Watase]
 21:  297| [45] ["--!?"]
 22:  302| [45] [Those words shot straight through Watase's heart.]
 23:  350| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  353| [45] ["Wha... Wait, what did you say...!?"]
 25:  361| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  364| [45] ["You didn't know, woman?"]
 27:  372| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  375| [45] ["You're lying... right...? The Captain would never do anything like that... right...?"]
 29:  383| [47] [Watase]
 30:  386| [45] ["..."]
 31:  391| [45] [Watase had no recollection of shooting Natsuhiko.]
 32:  396| [45] [However--]
 33:  598| [45] [--He had memories that he couldn't explain.]
 34:  603| [45] [Watase just stood there at a total loss for an answer. Salyu then whispered into Kazami's ear.]
 35:  611| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  614| [45] ["If you don't know, then I'll tell you."]
 37:  622| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  625| [45] ["This man is a terrorist."]
 39:  633| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  636| [45] ["He attacked us last night and this morning as well."]
 41:  644| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  647| [45] ["Everything that's happening here is all his fault."]
 43:  655| [47] [Salyu]
 44:  658| [45] ["Even you should have questioned that idea several times."]
 45:  666| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  669| [45] ["Stop... it...! I don't... want to hear... any more...!"]
 47:  677| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  680| [45] ["I trust the Captain..."]
 49:  688| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  691| [45] ["Then take a close look at what's in that man's pocket."]
 51:  788| [45] [She was of course talking about--]
 52:  793| [45] [--the gun that Watase had picked up in Area N.]
 53:  817| [47] [Salyu]
 54:  820| [45] ["That gun probably belonged to this man to begin with."]
 55:  828| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  831| [45] ["He used it to shoot Natsuh--"]
 57:  836| [45] [But at that moment,]
 58:  895| [47] [Kazami]
 59:  898| [45] ["--I SAID STOP!"]
 60:  903| [45] [Kazami screamed and violently shook Salyu off her.]
 61:  981| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  984| [45] ["!"]
 63:  989| [45] [Salyu's body was sent flying backwards.]
 64:  994| [45] [She then landed on the staircase--]
 65: 1002| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1005| [45] ["Ah...!"]
 67: 1010| [45] [All Watase could do was watch the whole thing from beginning to end.]
 68: 1022| [45] [Salyu proceeded to tumble down the staircase.]
 69: 1029| [45] [She finally stopped at the landing of the stairs at B1. She wasn't budging an inch.]
 70: 1037| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1040| [45] ["--Salyu!"]
 72: 1150| [45] [Watase frantically ran over to Salyu and checked her condition.]
 73: 1155| [45] [But luckily, she did not display any injuries such as bone fractures, and her pulse and breathing were stable as well.]
 74: 1160| [45] [Watase breathed a sigh of relief-- just as Kazami came walking down the staircase on shaky feet.]
 75: 1186| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1189| [45] ["Captain... is she...?"]
 77: 1194| [45] [Her face was deadly pale. She looked really shaken up.]
 78: 1202| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1205| [45] ["It's okay, she's just passed out."]
 80: 1231| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1234| [45] ["I-I see..."]
 82: 1239| [45] [Kazami's body was trembling.]
 83: 1244| [45] [She then looked to Watase.]
 84: 1249| [45] [--With eyes full of fear.]
 85: 1257| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1260| [45] ["Tachibana...?"]
 87: 1265| [45] [Kazami was acting weirdly.]
 88: 1270| [45] [She then wrapped her arms around her body as if she were trying to hold herself back.]
 89: 1296| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1299| [45] ["Captain, I..."]
 91: 1304| [45] [She suddenly stopped talking as quickly as she'd begun.]
 92: 1312| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1315| [45] ["... What's wrong?"]
 94: 1320| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1321| [45] ["..."]
 96: 1326| [45] [She didn't answer him.]
 97: 1331| [45] [All she did was stare at him carefully.]
 98: 1336| [45] [Anxiety welled up in Watase's heart.]
 99: 1344| [47] [Watase]
100: 1347| [45] ["... Tachibana, why... why are you looking at me like that?"]
101: 1355| [47] [Watase]
102: 1358| [45] ["Wait, you don't believe what Salyu said, do you?"]
103: 1366| [47] [Watase]
104: 1369| [45] ["It's ridiculous! There's no way in hell I could be a terrorist! I don't care if I have amnesia, I'm -sure- of that!"]
105: 1377| [47] [Watase]
106: 1380| [45] ["You guys know better than anyone else that I've been a rescue worker for ages, don't you!?"]
107: 1385| [47] [Kazami]
108: 1386| [45] ["..."]
109: 1391| [45] [Kazami didn't answer. Watase's anxiety only grew worse.]
110: 1396| [45] [Soon enough-- she began talking in a quiet voice as if attempting to rid herself of her fear.]
111: 1422| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1425| [45] ["... Captain, may I ask you just one question?"]
113: 1433| [47] [Watase]
114: 1436| [45] ["... What is it?"]
115: 1444| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1447| [45] ["This mystery has been on my mind for a long time..."]
117: 1473| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1476| [45] ["Captain, why was it that you went down to the basement at 6:42 AM, shortly after this accident occurred?"]
119: 1484| [47] [Watase]
120: 1487| [45] ["That's-- I told you guys, that's because Dojima and Hiyama called for me on their radio..."]
121: 1495| [47] [Kazami]
122: 1498| [45] ["So what you're saying is that your radio could receive transmissions then, correct?"]
123: 1524| [47] [Kazami]
124: 1527| [45] ["But... but you know..."]
125: 1535| [47] [Kazami]
126: 1538| [45] ["I personally tried to reach you on your radio just a few minutes before that...!"]
127: 1546| [47] [Watase]
128: 1549| [45] ["...!"]
129: 1554| [45] [Watase felt his insides freeze over.]
130: 1559| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Kazami had said something to that effect way back.]
131: 1564| [45] ["At 6:35 AM, radio communication with Watase had suddenly ceased".]
132: 1569| [45] [--There was an inconsistency with those words.]
133: 1574| [45] [Which meant--]
134: 1600| [47] [Kazami]
135: 1603| [45] ["Why was it that Dojima and Hiyama's transmission got through to your radio, yet mine did not...?"]
136: 1611| [47] [Kazami]
137: 1614| [45] ["Did you make it... so that my transmissions weren't received for some reason...?"]
138: 1640| [47] [Kazami]
139: 1643| [45] ["So that you could sneak off during a lifesaving mission and do something else?"]
140: 1651| [47] [Watase]
141: 1654| [45] ["H-hey-- how long have you been thinking that?"]
142: 1662| [47] [Kazami]
143: 1665| [45] ["Ever since you said you 'got some of your memories back'... when you told us why you went down to the basement."]
144: 1673| [47] [Kazami]
145: 1676| [45] ["But I didn't say anything... because I trusted you..."]
146: 1702| [47] [Kazami]
147: 1705| [45] ["I figured that time discrepancy was just you remembering the time incorrectly...!"]
148: 1710| [45] [Kazami lowered her eyes and continued in a shaky voice.]
149: 1718| [47] [Kazami]
150: 1721| [45] ["I... I tried as hard as I could to trust you."]
151: 1729| [47] [Kazami]
152: 1732| [45] ["I've trusted you for as long as I can remember."]
153: 1760| [47] [Kazami]
154: 1763| [45] ["No matter how much you changed... and regardless of your amnesia."]
155: 1789| [47] [Kazami]
156: 1792| [45] ["That's why I truly was happy when you held me in your arms earlier... I felt like you'd gone back to being your old self."]
157: 1818| [47] [Kazami]
158: 1821| [45] ["But... regardless, the past is just that and nothing more."]
159: 1829| [47] [Kazami]
160: 1832| [45] ["No matter how much I try to tell myself otherwise, I just..."]
161: 1859| [47] [Kazami]
162: 1862| [45] ["I just... can't trust you anymore."]
163: 1871| [47] [Watase]
164: 1874| [45] ["T-Tachibana...?"]
165: 1879| [45] [Just as she said that-- Kazami's face and tone of voice changed.]
166: 1905| [47] [Kazami]
167: 1908| [45] ["... I just can't do it, Watase."]
168: 1916| [47] [Kazami]
169: 1919| [45] ["If what Ms. Sannomiya said was true, then everything fits."]
170: 1927| [47] [Kazami]
171: 1930| [45] ["When I think of this facility's true nature and the past you... I realize that there's only one answer."]
172: 1938| [47] [Watase]
173: 1941| [45] ["What are you saying!?"]
174: 1967| [47] [Kazami]
175: 1970| [45] ["... If you are a murderer..."]
176: 1978| [47] [Kazami]
177: 1981| [45] ["Then the least I can do is preserve your good name...!"]
178: 2016| [45] [Kazami reached for a fire extinguisher stationed next to the emergency staircase.]
179: 2024| [47] [Watase]
180: 2027| [45] ["Wha... what are you going to do with that thing...?"]
181: 2032| [45] [Kazami didn't answer.]
182: 2037| [45] [Instead, she started talking again with a voice full of lament.]
183: 2063| [47] [Kazami]
184: 2066| [45] ["You went down the wrong path, Watase..."]
185: 2074| [47] [Kazami]
186: 2077| [45] ["... Now it's time for you to receive your punishment for that choice."]
187: 2082| [45] [And a second later,]
188: 2091| [47] [Watase]
189: 2094| [45] ["!?"]
190: 2207| [45] [Kazami swung the fire extinguisher sideways.]
191: 2236| [47] [Watase]
192: 2239| [45] ["Gwaagh!!"]
193: 2268| [45] [Watase immediately blocked it with his arm.]
194: 2273| [45] [His bones creaked beneath the force of Kazami's merciless assault.]
195: 2342| [47] [Watase]
196: 2345| [45] ["St-stop! Why are you doing this!?"]
197: 2371| [47] [Kazami]
198: 2374| [45] ["Watase... I'm so sorry, Watase..."]
199: 2400| [47] [Kazami]
200: 2403| [45] ["This is the only thing... I can do for you now..."]
201: 2470| [45] [Though she was apologizing, Kazami's eyes were filled with the intent to kill.]
202: 2509| [47] [Watase]
203: 2510| [45] [(Why's this happening to Tachibana too!?)]
204: 2515| [45] [Watase shuddered, then promptly thrust Kazami away.]
205: 2606| [47] [Kazami]
206: 2609| [45] ["Kyah!"]
207: 2614| [45] [She fell on the staircase with the fire extinguisher still in hand.]
208: 2668| [45] [Watase took that chance to rush down to B1 and dash out of the stairwell.]
209: 2718| [45] [He continued to carry Natsuhiko as he ran.]
210: 2723| [45] [He was worried about Salyu too, especially since she was still lying unconscious in the stairwell.]
211: 2728| [45] [But it was all he could do to try to take Natsuhiko to a safe place.]
212: 2736| [47] [Watase]
213: 2739| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell's going on!?"]
214: 2744| [45] [He and Kazami had been seeing each other heart to heart just a short while ago.]
215: 2749| [45] [They had been trusting each other. So why--!?]
216: 2754| [47] [Watase]
217: 2755| [45] [(Was it all just wishful thinking on my part!?)]
218: 2760| [45] [But the pain in his arm from Kazami's attack was all too real.]
219: 2765| [45] [It ached painfully with every vibration that came passing through him from the effort of running.]
220: 2770| [45] [As if to remind him of that harsh reality.]
221: 2819| [45] [He found himself blindly fleeing into one of the connecting passageways.]
222: 2824| [45] [But he heard footsteps coming down from just up ahead.]
223: 2829| [47] [Watase]
224: 2830| [45] [(Who's there!?)]
225: 2835| [45] [No sooner had he thought that than did he see Jun heading in his direction.]
226: 2909| [47] [Jun]
227: 2912| [45] ["Captain...!"]
228: 2917| [45] [She was still holding the engine cutter in her hands--]
229: 2975| [47] [Watase]
230: 2978| [45] ["!!"]
231: 2983| [45] [Watase turned around and ran for it.]
232: 3033| [45] [He kept on carrying Natsuhiko and escaped into some other area.]
233: 3038| [45] [He was panting. His whole body hurt like mad.]
234: 3043| [45] [But just as he felt he could run no more--]
235: 3058| [45] [A dry sound reached his ears.]
236: 3097| [47] [Watase]
237: 3100| [45] ["Gah!"]
238: 3105| [45] [Watase fell to the ground.]
239: 3110| [45] [His abdomen was hot. That heat soon warped into agony.]
240: 3115| [45] [He'd been shot in his flank.]
241: 3123| [47] [Watase]
242: 3126| [45] ["...!"]
243: 3131| [45] [Watase looked around as he pressed his hand against his abdomen.]
244: 3136| [45] [He couldn't see anyone, but he could hear a voice coming from somewhere.]
245: 3164| [47] [Ukita]
246: 3167| [45] ["Got you this time, Captain Kasasagi."]
247: 3175| [47] [Watase]
248: 3178| [45] ["O... old man...!?"]
249: 3186| [47] [Ukita]
250: 3189| [45] ["Oh, that looks like it really hurts. Then I'll bring you to rest right away as one last act of mercy."]
251: 3194| [45] [Watase stood up before Ukita finished talking.]
252: 3248| [45] [He reaffirmed his grip on Natsuhiko and started running again.]
253: 3253| [45] [All while blood was pouring from his flank.]
254: 3258| [45] [Fortunately, the bullet had apparently missed any organs.]
255: 3263| [45] [But the pain of the gunshot wound was great, and the bleeding just wouldn't stop.]
256: 3271| [47] [Watase]
257: 3274| [45] ["Shit... shit...!"]
258: 3279| [45] [Watase ran as he looked for a safe place.]
259: 3284| [45] [Before long-- he saw it.]
260: 3329| [45] [The connecting passageway to Area N.]
261: 3334| [45] [The only way to get past the gate that lay at the end was with the "Lv. N" card that Watase had!]
262: 3352| [47] [Watase]
263: 3355| [45] ["Uw... Uwooooooooh!"]
264: 3360| [45] [Watase screamed and spurred himself onwards.]
265: 3365| [45] [He then made a break for Area N.]
266: 3453| [45] [He opened the gate and tumbled his way to the other side.]
267: 3527| [45] [A strange sensation ran through him and his fingertips convulsed, most likely due to the effects of the WX particles.]
268: 3532| [45] [But Watase endured them.]
269: 3537| [47] [Watase]
270: 3538| [45] [(I'm the only one with a Level N card...)]
271: 3543| [47] [Watase]
272: 3544| [45] [(Which means I can shake them off if I close the gate!)]
273: 3549| [45] [But at that moment,]
274: 3554| [45] [he looked back at the open gate,]
275: 3715| [45] [and spotted Kazami in the passageway, fire extinguisher still in hand.]
276: 3720| [47] [Watase]
277: 3721| [45] [(!!)]
278: 3726| [45] [Her glare pierced Watase.]
279: 3731| [45] [And then--]
280: 3767| [45] [She made a mad dash straight for Watase!]
281: 3824| [47] [Watase]
282: 3827| [45] ["C'mon, close! Hurry up!"]
283: 3832| [45] [The gate started to slowly shut. But it wouldn't be fast enough.]
284: 3839| [45] [Kazami ran through the open gate,]
285: 3898| [45] [and swung her fire extinguisher down at Watase's head.]
286: 3927| [47] [Watase]
287: 3930| [45] ["Gagh!!"]
288: 3935| [45] [Sparks filled Watase's vision.]
289: 3959| [45] [His body shook left and right as he lost all sense of balance.]
290: 4004| [47] [Watase]
291: 4005| [45] [(Sh-she's gonna kill me if I don't do something...!)]
292: 4010| [47] [Watase]
293: 4011| [45] [(And if I die now... then Natsuhiko will also be in danger!)]
294: 4016| [45] [Those thoughts held Watase's splintering consciousness in place.]
295: 4021| [45] [He then mustered the last of his strength--]
296: 4038| [47] [Watase]
297: 4041| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAH!"]
298: 4067| [45] [And pushed Kazami right out of Area N.]
299: 4118| [47] [Kazami]
300: 4121| [45] ["Ghh!"]
301: 4132| [45] [Kazami grunted at almost the exact same moment that the gate finished shutting.]
302: 4180| [45] [Watase could hear her voice on the other side.]
303: 4188| [47] [Kazami]
304: 4191| [45] ["Watase! Wataseee!"]
305: 4199| [47] [Kazami]
306: 4202| [45] ["OPEN THE GATE, WATASE!"]
307: 4212| [45] [Her voice grew distant.]
308: 4217| [45] [Watase's headache and convulsions were growing more and more intense.]
309: 4222| [47] [Watase]
310: 4223| [45] [(--Did the AD wear off!?)]
311: 4228| [45] [All strength left him the moment he thought that.]
312: 4305| [47] [Watase]
313: 4308| [45] ["!"]
314: 4313| [45] [He suddenly felt faint.]
315: 4318| [45] [Watase tried to fight off that feeling--]
316: 4369| [45] [--But failed.]
317: 4374| [45] [The floor was growing closer and closer.]
318: 4379| [45] [Crap-- I'm falling!]
319: 4403| [45] [Watase felt Natsuhiko's weight vanish from his back at the same time he fell.]
320: 4408| [45] [It seemed the force had flung him to the side.]
321: 4413| [45] [But there was no longer anything Watase could do about that.]
