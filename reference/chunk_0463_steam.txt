  0:   65| [45] [--It was a memory of just about an hour ago.]
  1:   70| [45] [Salyu chased after Watase into a connecting passageway.]
  2:  169| [45] [Watase had broken the security gate's card slot to stop her from pursuing him.]
  3:  174| [47] [Salyu]
  4:  177| [45] ["What're you doing!?"]
  5:  300| [45] [Watase shouted to Salyu on the other side of the closing gate.]
  6:  326| [47] [Watase]
  7:  329| [45] ["I know you can't trust me, but this isn't the time to be fighting!"]
  8:  337| [47] [Watase]
  9:  340| [45] ["Go to Natsuhiko and the others! They're looking for you!"]
 10:  345| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  348| [45] ["!?"]
 12:  353| [45] [In the split second she stopped in surprise,]
 13:  557| [45] [the gate shut, separating Salyu from Watase.]
 14:  568| [45] [She stood still in front of the closed gate.]
 15:  573| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  574| [45] [(They're searching for me...? So they're safe?)]
 17:  579| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  580| [45] [(But why would that man tell me that? ... What's his goal?)]
 19:  585| [45] [She could find no answers. She tried to keep pursuing Watase for the time being, but--]
 20:  609| [45] [Her feet began to stagger.]
 21:  614| [45] [At the end of this nearly 10-hour battle, her fatigue finally caught up to her.]
 22:  619| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  620| [45] [(... But there's no way I can stop here...)]
 24:  625| [47] [Salyu]
 25:  626| [45] [(If that man's words were a trap, and Natsuhiko's in danger... then I need to go save him.)]
 26:  631| [45] [With that thought in mind, Salyu retraced her steps.]
 27:  693| [45] [As she walked down the long passage, she recalled her memories of Natsuhiko.]
 28:  745| [45] [At first, he was terribly unkind and they failed at introducing themselves to each other.]
 29:  809| [45] [But the next day, he praised her casual clothes and the distance between them shortened just a little.]
 30:  857| [45] [They looked up to the night sky together and talked about the stars.]
 31:  921| [45] [They told each other about themselves in the karaoke box...]
 32:  926| [45] [And when Natsuhiko looked at Salyu, Alice made a sound she had never heard from her before.]
 33:  931| [47] [Alice]
 34:  934| [45] ["Kyukyuuu~...!"]
 35:  939| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  942| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 37:  947| [45] [Salyu looked at Alice in disbelief.]
 38:  952| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  955| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, what were you thinking just now?"]
 40:  981| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  984| [45] ["Huh... n-nothing really..."]
 42:  989| [47] [Salyu]
 43:  992| [45] ["... Honest?"]
 44: 1000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45: 1003| [45] ["... Honest."]
 46: 1008| [45] [--Salyu didn't press him any further.]
 47: 1013| [45] [According to Alice, the emotion Natsuhiko displayed at that time--]
 48: 1018| [45] [Was "romantic feelings, otherwise, a proportionate fondness".]
 49: 1067| [47] [Salyu]
 50: 1068| [45] [(Natsuhiko has romantic feelings...?)]
 51: 1073| [47] [Salyu]
 52: 1074| [45] [(... for... me...?)]
 53: 1079| [47] [Salyu]
 54: 1080| [45] [(Preposterous. There's no reason he would...)]
 55: 1085| [47] [Salyu]
 56: 1086| [45] [(... But what if he really does...?)]
 57: 1091| [45] [--The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became.]
 58: 1096| [45] [Though it was a happy moment, it was also a moment that pained her heart--]
 59: 1101| [45] [So Salyu decided not to think about it any more.]
 60: 1162| [45] [But-- she still wondered.]
 61: 1167| [45] [Was she really fighting for Natsuhiko's sake just because he was an important friend to her?]
 62: 1172| [45] [Was she really only fighting to fulfill her duty?]
 63: 1177| [47] [Salyu]
 64: 1178| [45] [(... No.)]
 65: 1183| [45] [That wasn't how she felt.]
 66: 1188| [45] [--It was a very tough realization for Salyu to make.]
 67: 1193| [45] [She couldn't understand other people's feelings.]
 68: 1198| [45] [So if she were to start harboring such emotions, it was all too easy to imagine a sad ending awaiting her.]
 69: 1203| [47] [Salyu]
 70: 1204| [45] [(But regardless... that doesn't mean I'll change my actions in the slightest.)]
 71: 1209| [45] [After all, Natsuhiko had once told Salyu this:]
 72: 1287| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1290| [45] ["... You don't need a full understanding of what's on other people's minds. But as long as you keep striving for it... In other words, as long as you keep other people in consideration..."]
 74: 1298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1301| [45] ["Then I'm sure things will turn out for the best. Both for you and for those you interact with..."]
 76: 1384| [45] [That was why Salyu didn't mind struggling for his sake.]
 77: 1389| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1390| [45] [(... There's only one thing I'm sure of.)]
 79: 1395| [47] [Salyu]
 80: 1396| [45] [(And it's that Natsuhiko definitely doesn't want to die.)]
 81: 1401| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1402| [45] [(So I'm fighting for his sake because...)]
 83: 1411| [45] [--It was the only thing Salyu could think of that was certainly "right" throughout her life of fumbling her way forward in the darkness.]
 84: 1416| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1417| [45] [(My feelings don't matter right now.)]
 86: 1422| [47] [Salyu]
 87: 1423| [45] [(I just have to work hard for Natsuhiko and Mashiro.)]
 88: 1428| [45] [So that they could all survive together--]
