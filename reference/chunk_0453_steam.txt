  0:   65| [45] [--It was a cold, gloomy room, almost like a prison.]
  1:   70| [45] [Salyu stood still in that room, thinking to herself. ]
  2:   75| [45] ["My entire world lies within this facility."]
  3:   80| [45] [At that time, the door opened--]
  4:  106| [47] [Miyoko]
  5:  109| [45] ["Yui, come out."]
  6:  114| [45] [And that voice beckoned her.]
  7:  152| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  155| [45] ["It's time for experiments."]
  9:  160| [45] [As Dr. Tenkawa entered the room, Salyu asked her a question.]
 10:  165| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  168| [45] ["Whose memory are we transferring today?"]
 12:  176| [47] [Miyoko]
 13:  179| [45] ["Professor Emeritus Kagano, an authority on fluid mechanics."]
 14:  184| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  187| [45] ["Fluid mechanics. Not interested."]
 16:  213| [47] [Miyoko]
 17:  216| [45] ["You might actually find it interesting once you understand it, you know?"]
 18:  224| [47] [Miyoko]
 19:  227| [45] ["After all, it only takes a moment."]
 20:  232| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa was indeed right.]
 21:  237| [45] [Salyu nodded and followed her outside the room.]
 22:  341| [45] [Other researchers were waiting outside.]
 23:  346| [45] [They brought Salyu through the underground garden and stopped in front of Subject N's room.]
 24:  402| [45] [There, they blindfolded Salyu and bound her feet and hands.]
 25:  446| [45] [Beyond that door was "Subject N".]
 26:  451| [45] [Anyone who wanted to meet her had to be either completely bound or injected with AD.]
 27:  462| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa and the other researchers opened the door and brought Salyu into Subject N's room.]
 28:  486| [47] [Subject N]
 29:  489| [45] ["... Welcome back."]
 30:  494| [45] [They heard Subject N's voice.]
 31:  499| [45] [The researchers soon responded.]
 32:  504| [47] [Eriguchi]
 33:  507| [45] ["We're starting now, Subject N."]
 34:  512| [47] [Kashiwagi]
 35:  515| [45] ["Starting Memory Transfer Experiment Phase 2, Trial 316."]
 36:  520| [47] [Kashiwagi]
 37:  523| [45] ["From No. 3, Subject N, to No. 2, Subject Y. Begin Senses Sympathy."]
 38:  528| [47] [Subject N]
 39:  531| [45] ["Okay."]
 40:  543| [45] [And with that signal, a flood of "information" flowed into Salyu's head.]
 41:  555| [45] [It was the memory of the "fluid mechanics authority" or whomever it was that Dr. Tenkawa spoke about earlier.]
 42:  567| [47] [Salyu]
 43:  570| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 44:  575| [45] [Salyu groaned.]
 45:  580| [45] [Though it only took a moment each time, Salyu could never get used to that feeling.]
 46:  585| [45] [Even though it was only memories that were being written onto her brain, it felt like even her own mind was being rewritten.]
 47:  590| [47] [Subject N]
 48:  593| [45] ["--Done."]
 49:  598| [45] [But as soon as Subject N gave the word, the bizarre sensation faded.]
 50:  603| [47] [Eriguchi]
 51:  606| [45] ["Roger that. Now withdraw Subject Y."]
 52:  611| [45] [Salyu was then taken out of the room again.]
 53:  700| [45] [Once they were in the underground garden, Dr. Tenkawa took out her PDA and handed it over to Salyu.]
 54:  708| [47] [Miyoko]
 55:  711| [45] ["Yui, try solving this problem for me."]
 56:  722| [45] [On her PDA screen was a problem relating to fluid mechanics.]
 57:  727| [45] ["In August 2015, a solid body flow pattern was confirmed near Jupiter's south pole.]
 58:  732| [45] [The following data table represents a two-dimensional model of that flow pattern.]
 59:  737| [45] [Based on the data, explain the mechanism behind the formation of the flow pattern."]
 60:  742| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  745| [45] ["Roger."]
 62:  756| [45] [Salyu took the PDA and smoothly solved the problem.]
 63:  762| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa looked at Salyu's solution and then spoke.]
 64:  788| [47] [Miyoko]
 65:  791| [45] ["Yes, that is correct."]
 66:  796| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  799| [45] ["Naturally."]
 68:  804| [45] [It was no surprise.]
 69:  809| [45] [For that problem itself was made by the very same fluid mechanics authority whose memory Salyu now had.]
 70:  814| [45] [Thus, there was no conceivable way Salyu would be unable to solve it.]
 71:  840| [47] [Miyoko]
 72:  843| [45] ["Successful memory transfer confirmed. Memory Transfer Experiment Phase 2, Trial 316 complete."]
 73:  848| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa spoke those words into a voice recorder and then addressed Salyu.]
 74:  874| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  877| [45] ["That finishes up your work for today. Let's head back to your room."]
 76:  882| [47] [Salyu]
 77:  885| [45] ["All right."]
 78:  890| [45] [And with that answer, Dr. Tenkawa brought Salyu back to the room she started out in.]
 79:  895| [45] [This was Salyu's one and only unconditional "role".]
 80:  950| [45] [To be a part of LABO's 4 years and going "Memory Transfer Experiment".%NThe subject matter of the experiment was simple:]
 81:  955| [45] [First, LABO would invite "guests" with technical expertise to come to the facility.]
 82:  960| [45] [After putting a guest to sleep with drugs, they would quickly bring them to Subject N's room.]
 83:  965| [45] [There, Subject N would apply Senses Sympathy to steal all of the guest's knowledge.]
 84:  970| [45] [A skilled Level 6 Communicator is able to handle memories inside the human mind almost as if they were digital data.]
 85:  975| [45] [The Communicator could copy and paste the memories into their own mind, as well as bestow their own memories to a third party.]
 86:  980| [45] [Such tasks were easy, assuming one could manipulate intracerebral BC particles at will.]
 87:  985| [45] [Furthermore, the entire process took only a negligible amount of time.]
 88:  990| [45] [The guest would be left with a memory gap, but all Subject N had to do was fill it in with a fabricated memory.]
 89:  995| [45] [Once the drugs wore off and the guest woke up, they would not remember a thing. They would not even be aware that anything had happened to them.]
 90: 1000| [45] [It was an extremely efficient, perfectly imperceptible theft of trade secrets.]
 91: 1005| [45] [The backbone of an industrial espionage effort created by LABO, Rokumei City, and a certain corporation.]
 92: 1010| [47] [Salyu]
 93: 1011| [45] [(It's a well-planned system...)]
 94: 1016| [45] [That was what Salyu thought.]
 95: 1021| [45] [There were several ways of inviting the guests as well.]
 96: 1026| [45] [Sometimes they'd be invited directly with made-up business. Sometimes they'd visit LABO of their own accord.]
 97: 1031| [45] [Rokumei City Hospital was yet another entity in on the deal, and thus there were cases where they had drugged patients who had useful knowledge and transported them to LABO.]
 98: 1036| [45] [Thus, LABO obtained knowledge from visiting guests and applied that knowledge for use in its own facility.]
 99: 1041| [45] [In its greed, LABO also stole trade secrets that had no direct relation to BC in order to sell them off to other research facilities they had connections with.]
100: 1046| [45] [--Salyu's role was to be one of the final cogs in the process.]
101: 1051| [45] [All of the memories and knowledge Subject N stole from the guests were transcribed onto Salyu's brain.]
102: 1056| [45] [As a backup, so to speak.]
103: 1061| [45] [Salyu was thus a "spare brain" for Subject N.]
104: 1066| [45] [That said, Salyu didn't think much about it.]
105: 1071| [45] [She had already been burdened with that role for as long as she could remember.]
106: 1076| [45] [Just once or twice a week, the professor would come bring her to Subject N's room and back, just like today.]
107: 1081| [45] [And as long as she did that, she received all of her living necessities.]
108: 1086| [45] [All necessities except for freedom, that is.]
109: 1167| [47] [Miyoko]
110: 1170| [45] ["... Good work today."]
111: 1175| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa thanked her as always.]
112: 1180| [45] [But Salyu noticed her voice was just a little bit quieter than usual.]
113: 1185| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1188| [45] ["Professor, what's wrong?"]
115: 1214| [47] [Miyoko]
116: 1217| [45] ["It's nothing. I'm just a little tired. We've been busy recently, you see."]
117: 1222| [45] [Salyu was relieved. As long as the professor said so, it was probably just that.]
118: 1248| [47] [Miyoko]
119: 1251| [45] ["I'm sorry, but I've got matters to attend to, so I'll be going now. I'll show up again later."]
120: 1256| [47] [Salyu]
121: 1259| [45] ["When's the next appointment?"]
122: 1285| [47] [Miyoko]
123: 1288| [45] ["Hmm... it might not be for a while, actually."]
124: 1314| [47] [Miyoko]
125: 1317| [45] ["Subject N hasn't been well lately."]
126: 1322| [47] [Salyu]
127: 1325| [45] ["Really."]
128: 1330| [45] [Salyu felt glad that she wouldn't have to deal with that troublesome sensation, but at the same time, she felt a little lonely that the appointments were diminishing.]
129: 1356| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1359| [45] ["I'll be sure to tell you when an appointment's scheduled. See you later."]
131: 1416| [45] [And with that, the professor left the room.]
132: 1421| [45] [Salyu gazed at the shut door.]
133: 1426| [45] [As long as nobody opened that door from the outside, it would never open.]
134: 1431| [45] [Salyu thought she would have a bit of free time until the next time the professor came.]
135: 1477| [45] [--Salyu herself wasn't quite sure of how long this had continued.]
136: 1482| [45] [Such a trifling past had sunk to the bottom of her vast, oft-rewritten pool of knowledge.]
137: 1487| [45] [But what she did remember was that when she was younger, she had a different sort of role.]
138: 1492| [47] [Salyu]
139: 1493| [45] [(If I'm not mistaken, that was the experiment to inundate the body with WX particles...)]
140: 1552| [45] [In those experiments, Salyu was exposed to a WX particle-filled environment created in Area N for extended periods of time.]
141: 1557| [45] [Exposure to such an environment could artificially raise BC aptitude-- or at least that was the goal of the experiment.]
142: 1562| [45] [But Salyu showed no results.]
143: 1567| [45] [The experiments failed, leaving her with the Rank F Aptitude she was born with.]
144: 1625| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1626| [45] [(Compared to back then, any experiment would be better...)]
146: 1631| [45] [Salyu was thankful that those experiments had ended five years ago.]
147: 1636| [45] [The current "memory transfer experiment" hadn't had a single failure.]
148: 1641| [47] [Salyu]
149: 1642| [45] [(... Unlike the experiments in the past, these ones have a definite purpose.)]
150: 1702| [45] [Although she was a backup, Salyu was unable to leave and had gained all sorts of knowledge.]
151: 1707| [45] [She proved that even knowledge of how to perform physical techniques could be inherited.]
152: 1712| [45] [--By the age of 6, she had a complete understanding of Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" and was able to identify its points of issue from an existentialist perspective.]
153: 1717| [45] [By the age of 7, she solved the mystery of the zeta function that had been plaguing mathematicians across the globe. She also proved the Riemann Hypothesis.]
154: 1723| [45] [By the age of 8, she inherited the knowledge of an elderly pianist and successfully played the extremely difficult piano piece, "Gaspard de la nuit".]
155: 1728| [45] [By the age of 9, she had learned all sorts of athletic techniques ranging from artistic gymnastics to ball games and martial arts.]
156: 1733| [45] [By today, at the age of 10-- Salyu had the knowledge of 316 specialists of all sorts of fields packed within her brain.]
157: 1792| [47] [Salyu]
158: 1793| [45] [(... And thus, I became a monster.)]
159: 1798| [45] [The amount of knowledge in Salyu's brain had undeniably exceeded the apparent limit for human beings.]
160: 1803| [45] [Her swelling pool of knowledge was her entire life's history--]
161: 1808| [45] [--and before she knew it, it was the very proof of her existence.]
