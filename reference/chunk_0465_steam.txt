  0:   61| [45] [16 years ago, back when Watase was 16--]
  1:   66| [45] [That day, Watase had been quietly reading a book in his room as he listened to classical music.]
  2:   71| [45] [He then heard "her" voice echo through his ears.]
  3:  109| [47] [Wataru]
  4:  112| [45] ["Waaa-taaa-seeee!"]
  5:  117| [45] [Watase's calm, relaxing time was completely annihilated by that voice.]
  6:  122| [47] [Watase]
  7:  123| [45] [(Oh great, her again...?)]
  8:  146| [45] [Watase turned around to see a girl whose face resembled his own--]
  9:  151| [45] ["Wataru".]
 10:  159| [47] [Watase]
 11:  162| [45] ["Oh come on Wataru, I don't think the whole neighborhood quite heard that one. Something up?"]
 12:  191| [47] [Wataru]
 13:  194| [45] ["Look outside! Isn't the weather just wonderful!?"]
 14:  202| [47] [Watase]
 15:  205| [45] ["Huh... wait, that's it?"]
 16:  231| [47] [Wataru]
 17:  234| [45] ["Quit burying your head in those textbooks and come outside and play with me!"]
 18:  242| [47] [Watase]
 19:  245| [45] ["No. Playing outside just 'cause the weather's nice is something kids do."]
 20:  314| [47] [Wataru]
 21:  317| [45] ["Aw, don't be a spoilsport. You're gonna grow mold if you stay cooped up in this room forever."]
 22:  322| [45] [Wataru forcefully pried Watase away from his desk.]
 23:  330| [47] [Watase]
 24:  333| [45] ["H-hey..."]
 25:  359| [47] [Wataru]
 26:  362| [45] ["C'mon, let's get a move on. We're gonna go to the city, so hurry up and get your things!"]
 27:  370| [47] [Watase]
 28:  373| [45] ["... Okay, fine. Just give me a sec."]
 29:  421| [45] [Watase tried resisting her for a short while, but he soon caved in.]
 30:  426| [45] [He knew better by now than to go against Wataru whenever she wanted to do something.]
 31:  471| [45] [The gentle sunlight bathed the city streets.]
 32:  476| [45] [Watase and Wataru walked side by side in that weather.]
 33:  511| [47] [Wataru]
 34:  514| [45] ["Mmm, it really is such a nice day, huh? Feels like the whole world's shining~"]
 35:  522| [47] [Watase]
 36:  525| [45] ["Good point."]
 37:  530| [45] [Watase replied to Wataru's overjoyed voice with an apathetic mutter.]
 38:  603| [45] [Though she was his older twin sister and had almost the exact same face as him, their personalities could not be any more different.]
 39:  608| [45] [Watase was an indoors person who liked spending his days off reading books.]
 40:  613| [45] [Hence why the only reason he was out of the house right now was because Wataru had taken him out around town.]
 41:  674| [47] [Watase]
 42:  677| [45] ["So why'd you want to go to the city? Need to do something here?"]
 43:  703| [47] [Wataru]
 44:  706| [45] ["Nah, just figured I'd go look and see if there was anything I could get for you. Just got my latest paycheck from my part time job, so it's on me."]
 45:  714| [47] [Watase]
 46:  717| [45] ["Oh, then maybe some paperbacks from the bookstore would be nice..."]
 47:  744| [47] [Wataru]
 48:  747| [45] ["No and no. That'd kill the whole purpose of me treating you. We need something that we'll actually have fun buying..."]
 49:  773| [47] [Wataru]
 50:  776| [45] ["I know! How about your big sis picks out some clothes for you!?"]
 51:  784| [47] [Watase]
 52:  787| [45] ["Huh, no, you don't need to."]
 53:  813| [47] [Wataru]
 54:  816| [45] ["Why not? You've actually got some nice looks to start out with, so you can't let it go to waste by being plain all the time."]
 55:  824| [47] [Watase]
 56:  827| [45] ["Is that your subtle way of complimenting yourself?"]
 57:  853| [47] [Wataru]
 58:  856| [45] ["Ehe hee hee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 59:  861| [45] [Wataru walked with a clear destination in mind as they had that talk.]
 60:  909| [45] [She took Watase to a "cheap trendy clothes" shop and bought him all sorts of clothes.]
 61:  973| [45] [They left the store with Watase covered in his new apparel, and with Wataru looking at him approvingly.]
 62:  999| [47] [Wataru]
 63: 1002| [45] ["... Yeah, it's perfect! You're looking pretty sharp there, if I do say so myself."]
 64: 1010| [47] [Watase]
 65: 1013| [45] ["Think so?"]
 66: 1018| [45] [Watase had never been particularly mindful of what he wore. He just didn't think it was all that important.]
 67: 1026| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1029| [45] ["Whatever. Anyway, I'm starving. Let's get a bite to eat."]
 69: 1055| [47] [Wataru]
 70: 1058| [45] ["Okay then, but it's on you this time, you hear?"]
 71: 1066| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1069| [45] ["Mmph... oh fine, I guess I can do that."]
 73: 1095| [47] [Wataru]
 74: 1098| [45] ["Yay! Then let's go to the usual pasta joint."]
 75: 1103| [45] [Cheering happily and with a skip in her step, Wataru walked off. Watase followed behind her languidly.]
 76: 1111| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1114| [45] ["... But are you sure you want to be spending your Sunday hanging out with your brother?"]
 78: 1140| [47] [Wataru]
 79: 1143| [45] ["Why not? It's a really beautiful day and it's the weekend."]
 80: 1151| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1154| [45] ["You don't have a boyfriend or anything?"]
 82: 1180| [47] [Wataru]
 83: 1183| [45] ["Oh, I don't need someone like that. Not when I've got my cute little brother!"]
 84: 1191| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1194| [45] ["Ugh."]
 86: 1255| [47] [Wataru]
 87: 1258| [45] ["Hey, what's with that reaction! That ain't cute at all!"]
 88: 1263| [45] [Watase let out a wry laugh at Wataru's melodramatic voice.]
 89: 1312| [45] [The twins then finished eating--]
 90: 1361| [45] [They checked the bookstore afterwards and looked at some new novels, and before they knew it, the sun was coming down.]
 91: 1429| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1432| [45] ["It's gonna get dark real soon. Shouldn't we be heading home?"]
 93: 1458| [47] [Wataru]
 94: 1461| [45] ["Yeah. We left without telling Mom and Dad a thing, after all."]
 95: 1466| [45] [The twins decided to walk home to save money on bus fare.]
 96: 1514| [45] [--And on their way home--]
 97: 1519| [45] [Wataru suddenly shouted as they passed the fire department.]
 98: 1552| [47] [Wataru]
 99: 1555| [45] ["Ah! Watase, look! Look at that!"]
100: 1563| [47] [Watase]
101: 1566| [45] ["Hmm?"]
102: 1581| [45] [Watase looked into the station to see men wearing orange uniforms coming out.]
103: 1589| [47] [Watase]
104: 1592| [45] ["Who're they? Look a bit too snazzy to be firefighters."]
105: 1624| [47] [Wataru]
106: 1627| [45] ["They're a rescue squad."]
107: 1635| [47] [Watase]
108: 1638| [45] ["A rescue squad? Our city has one of those?"]
109: 1664| [47] [Wataru]
110: 1667| [45] ["Nope. They were probably just sent in from Tokyo or somewhere to give our firefighters some disaster prevention training."]
111: 1675| [47] [Watase]
112: 1678| [45] ["Huh. So what's the big deal about them?"]
113: 1704| [47] [Wataru]
114: 1707| [45] ["Whaddya mean, 'what's the big deal'? They're so cool!"]
115: 1715| [47] [Watase]
116: 1718| [45] ["Huh...? Oh, so you're into macho men like that?"]
117: 1744| [47] [Wataru]
118: 1747| [45] ["No, not that! I'm strictly talking about their job, not their appeal as men."]
119: 1773| [47] [Wataru]
120: 1776| [45] ["They go through hell and high water all to save lives! I really look up to people like that."]
121: 1784| [47] [Watase]
122: 1787| [45] ["Really?"]
123: 1813| [47] [Wataru]
124: 1816| [45] ["But there's no female rescue workers out there now, huh?"]
125: 1824| [47] [Wataru]
126: 1827| [45] ["If possible, I'd like to be one."]
127: 1835| [47] [Watase]
128: 1838| [45] ["What? That's news to me. You want a crappy job like that?"]
129: 1864| [47] [Wataru]
130: 1867| [45] ["Hey, don't call it a crappy job! It's a wonderful line of work!"]
131: 1875| [47] [Watase]
132: 1878| [45] ["Sorry, tongue slipped. But a rescue worker, huh..."]
133: 1927| [45] [Watase carefully looked Wataru over.]
134: 1932| [45] [She certainly had the attitude, but she wasn't all that good at sports.]
135: 1940| [47] [Watase]
136: 1943| [45] ["... I think it'll be tough for you."]
137: 1973| [47] [Wataru]
138: 1976| [45] ["Won't know until I actually make it to that point. I'll think about that stuff after I become one."]
139: 1984| [47] [Watase]
140: 1987| [45] ["I'm worried about -if- you can become one."]
141: 1995| [47] [Wataru]
142: 1998| [45] ["Hey! It's in really bad taste to stomp on people's dreams. Don't you have a dream?"]
143: 2006| [47] [Watase]
144: 2009| [45] ["Not in particular."]
145: 2035| [47] [Wataru]
146: 2038| [45] ["Huuh? Man, you're a real lonely boy, you know that?"]
147: 2046| [47] [Watase]
148: 2049| [45] ["Can't blame me on that one. The world's in recession and Japan's hitting a dead end.%NFuture's not looking all that bright."]
149: 2075| [47] [Wataru]
150: 2078| [45] ["You're overthinking things, Watase."]
151: 2104| [47] [Wataru]
152: 2107| [45] ["Do that and you'll just wuss out to the point where you won't be able to make sense of anything anymore."]
153: 2115| [47] [Watase]
154: 2118| [45] ["You really think so? Personally, I think it'd be better for you to think a bit before you act."]
155: 2123| [45] [He'd rather not be thinking along the same lines as her.]
156: 2128| [45] [But Wataru paid no heed to Watase's disapproval as she lifted her hand in the air.]
157: 2154| [47] [Wataru]
158: 2157| [45] ["Okay, I've made up my mind! Running training starts tomorrow!"]
159: 2165| [47] [Watase]
160: 2168| [45] ["Hmm, sure, sounds nice. Try to stick with this one longer than three days."]
161: 2222| [47] [Wataru]
162: 2225| [45] ["Why're you talking like you're not a part of this? You're gonna train with me."]
163: 2233| [47] [Watase]
164: 2236| [45] ["H-HUUUUH!? Why me?"]
165: 2262| [47] [Wataru]
166: 2265| [45] ["'Cause it'll last longer with two people, right? Besides, it's the perfect way to get your scrawny body into shape, right?"]
167: 2273| [47] [Watase]
168: 2276| [45] ["S-sounds like a total pain in the ass..."]
169: 2281| [45] [But as usual, Wataru wouldn't change her mind no matter what he said.]
170: 2286| [45] [And she was right that Watase was out of shape.]
171: 2294| [47] [Watase]
172: 2297| [45] ["... Okay, fine, I'll train with you. But only for a little while."]
173: 2323| [47] [Wataru]
174: 2326| [45] ["Yay! See, this is what brothers are for."]
175: 2331| [45] [Wataru let out a smile filled with happiness from the bottom of her heart.]
176: 2352| [45] [--What she had talked about may not have been enough to call a dream.]
177: 2357| [45] [But it was a fact that she was looking forward to her own future.]
178: 2362| [45] [Her innocent and pure hopes for her future...]
179: 2367| [45] [Having nothing like that at all, Watase couldn't help but be a little jealous of his sister.]
