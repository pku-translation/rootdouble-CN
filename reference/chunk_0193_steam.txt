  1:   58| [45] [--After Natsuhiko had heard Yuuri's parents quarreling at home--]
  2:   63| [45] [Natsuhiko worried about Yuuri and went to the park every day to see her.]
  3:   68| [45] [But three days passed with no sign of her...]
  4:   73| [45] [So on the fourth day, he made up his mind and headed to her house once more.]
  5:  147| [45] [--Yuuri was standing all alone in front of her house.]
  6:  152| [45] [With a horribly sad look on her face.]
  7:  157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  160| [45] ["Yuuri."]
  9:  180| [45] [Her face shined like the sun as soon as she heard his voice.]
 10:  206| [47] [Yuuri]
 11:  209| [45] ["Ah, Natsuhiko. Did you come to play?"]
 12:  243| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  246| [45] ["Y-yeah. You weren't coming to the park, so I got worried..."]
 14:  272| [47] [Yuuri]
 15:  275| [45] ["I see. I'm so happy. I wanted to play with you too."]
 16:  280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  283| [45] ["You should've just come to the park then."]
 18:  309| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  312| [45] ["But I can't. I'm not 'sposed to."]
 20:  320| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  323| [45] ["Mom and Dad say I can't play with the other kids in town..."]
 22:  328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  331| [45] ["...!"]
 24:  336| [45] [Now that she had mentioned it, he remembered that her parents had called Communicators disgusting.]
 25:  341| [45] [Even though their own daughter was a Communicator herself.]
 26:  346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  349| [45] ["I see... so let's play in secret, then."]
 28:  354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  357| [45] ["Should we play at your place? Or my place?"]
 30:  383| [47] [Yuuri]
 31:  386| [45] ["We can't at my place. Mom and Dad are there."]
 32:  392| [45] [--And then Natsuhiko heard that angry voice roar from the house again.]
 33:  397| [47] [Mr. Kotono]
 34:  400| [45] ["Hey, do something with that brat by the door! She's such a damn annoying pest!"]
 35:  405| [47] [Mrs. Kotono]
 36:  408| [45] ["All your goddamn selfishness does is drive her away! If you don't even want to bother raising her, then shut yer damn trap!"]
 37:  431| [47] [Yuuri]
 38:  432| [45] ["..."]
 39:  437| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  438| [45] ["..."]
 41:  443| [45] [Natsuhiko felt he had never heard such abusive language in his life.]
 42:  448| [45] [Yuuri's expression grew darker and darker.]
 43:  453| [45] [Unable to stand any more of it, Natsuhiko spoke up to her.]
 44:  464| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  467| [45] ["... Okay, Yuuri. Let's go to the park right now."]
 46:  493| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  496| [45] ["Huh?"]
 48:  501| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  504| [45] ["It doesn't have to be the park. Just anywhere away from here."]
 50:  530| [47] [Yuuri]
 51:  533| [45] ["But if I go off and play on my own, then Dad might get mad at me..."]
 52:  538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  541| [45] ["Forget about your dad. You don't want to play with me, Yuuri?"]
 54:  567| [47] [Yuuri]
 55:  570| [45] ["... Of course I do."]
 56:  575| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  578| [45] ["Then let's go! C'mon!"]
 58:  583| [45] [Natsuhiko pulled Yuuri by the hand.]
 59:  588| [45] [He wanted to take Yuuri as far away from there as soon as possible.]
 60:  593| [45] [Yuuri hesitated for a second, but--]
 61:  628| [47] [Yuuri]
 62:  631| [45] ["Ah..."]
 63:  657| [47] [Yuuri]
 64:  660| [45] ["... Okay."]
 65:  665| [45] [She nodded ever so slightly and followed Natsuhiko.]
 66:  783| [45] [--Natsuhiko took Yuuri to the park.]
 67:  788| [45] [He thought that if even Mashiro were there, they could have a fun playtime, but--]
 68:  814| [47] [Yuuri]
 69:  817| [45] ["There's nobody here..."]
 70:  822| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  825| [45] ["Y-yeah, you're right."]
 72:  830| [45] [--unfortunately, nobody was around that day.]
 73:  835| [45] [Perhaps everyone was at the "secret base" in the outskirts of town.]
 74:  840| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  843| [45] ["... Well, fine. Let's just play by ourselves."]
 76:  848| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  851| [45] ["What should we play?"]
 78:  877| [47] [Yuuri]
 79:  880| [45] ["We don't have any books with us today... so how about we just take a walk or something?"]
 80:  885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81:  888| [45] ["Huh? S-sure. If that's okay with you, Yuuri..."]
 82:  893| [45] [The two of them took an aimless stroll around the park.]
 83:  898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84:  901| [45] ["... You having fun?"]
 85:  927| [47] [Yuuri]
 86:  930| [45] ["I am. Because I'm with you after all, Natsuhiko."]
 87:  935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88:  938| [45] ["Well, as long as you are... I'm sure we'd be able to play more fun things if my other friends were around, though."]
 89:  964| [47] [Yuuri]
 90:  967| [45] ["Other friends?"]
 91:  972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  975| [45] ["Hmm, let's see... if it had to be a girl, then..."]
 93:  980| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94:  983| [45] ["Oh right. There's this girl called Mashiro. She's super energetic and super loud, too."]
 95:  988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96:  991| [45] ["I'm sure you two would get along quickly if you met."]
 97: 1017| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1020| [45] ["Mashiro, huh? Do you think she'd bother being friends with someone like me?"]
 99: 1025| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1028| [45] ["It'd be fine. She's dumb, but the one good thing about her is that she easily makes friends with anyone."]
101: 1033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1036| [45] ["Come to think of it, there was this one time when she..."]
103: 1041| [45] [Natsuhiko was determined to just keep on talking.]
104: 1046| [45] [He wanted Yuuri to forget about the time and her troubles at home as much as possible.]
105: 1051| [45] [But no matter how hard he tried-- Natsuhiko could not keep the sun from setting.]
106: 1175| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1178| [45] ["... It's gonna get dark soon, huh."]
108: 1183| [45] [Yuuri signed as she looked at the setting sun.]
109: 1188| [45] [Her smile had already faded away.]
110: 1196| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 1199| [45] ["I have to go back home."]
112: 1204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1207| [45] ["... You do?"]
114: 1233| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1236| [45] ["Yeah. If I'm out too late, then Dad gets mad at me..."]
116: 1241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1242| [45] ["..."]
118: 1268| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1271| [45] ["Bye bye, Natsuhiko. Let's play again, okay?"]
120: 1276| [45] [And with that farewell, Yuuri slowly walked away.]
121: 1281| [45] [She shrank as if in a silent cry for help--]
122: 1286| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1289| [45] ["... Wait, Yuuri!"]
124: 1294| [45] [Without thinking, Natsuhiko raised his voice.]
125: 1320| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1323| [45] ["Huh...?"]
127: 1328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1331| [45] ["Yuuri, you don't want to go home, do you?"]
129: 1357| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1360| [45] ["Th-that's not true..."]
131: 1368| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1371| [45] ["I'm sure Mom and Dad are worried about me..."]
133: 1376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1379| [45] ["I'm not asking about your Mom and Dad. I want to know what you really want."]
135: 1387| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1390| [45] ["But, it's... it's not like I can just run away from home..."]
137: 1395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1396| [45] ["..."]
139: 1422| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1425| [45] ["So I, well... I -do- want to go home...!"]
141: 1430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1433| [45] ["That's a lie!"]
143: 1438| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1441| [45] ["There's no way you'd want to go back to a home like that!"]
145: 1467| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 1470| [45] ["!?"]
147: 1475| [45] [Yuuri's face cramped.]
148: 1480| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart hurt-- but he felt like he would regret it if he let her go home then and there.]
149: 1485| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 1488| [45] ["... Yuuri, please. Tell me how you really feel."]
151: 1493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1496| [45] ["Do you really want to go back to a home filled with shouting all the time?"]
153: 1519| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 1520| [45] ["..."]
155: 1525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1526| [45] ["..."]
157: 1552| [47] [Yuuri]
158: 1555| [45] ["... *sniff*"]
159: 1616| [47] [Yuuri]
160: 1619| [45] ["*sob*"]
161: 1624| [45] [Finally the dam broke and Yuuri's tears came pouring out.]
162: 1632| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 1635| [45] ["I don't want to go back! I want to stay with you, Natsuhiko!"]
164: 1640| [45] [She fell into Natsuhiko's chest and cried out for help.]
165: 1648| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 1651| [45] ["I hate how Mom never listens to me no matter what I say!"]
167: 1659| [47] [Yuuri]
168: 1662| [45] ["I hate how Dad says I'm a pest no matter where I go!"]
169: 1670| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 1673| [45] ["I hate how Mom and Dad never tell me what I've done that's so wrong!"]
171: 1681| [47] [Yuuri]
172: 1684| [45] ["I try not to get in the way! I try to be a good girl!"]
173: 1692| [47] [Yuuri]
174: 1695| [45] ["I try my bestest not to make them mad!"]
175: 1703| [47] [Yuuri]
176: 1706| [45] ["*sniff*... *sob*... waaaaahhh!"]
177: 1732| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 1735| [45] ["Help me, Natsuhiko! Help me!"]
179: 1740| [45] [Yuuri's sobs echoed through the twilit park.]
180: 1745| [45] [Her spilling tears soaked Natsuhiko's chest.]
181: 1750| [45] [As he watched her scream and shout, Natsuhiko remembered something.]
182: 1755| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 1756| [45] [(Ahh, that's right...)]
184: 1761| [45] [The first day they met in this park, Yuuri had been crying too.]
185: 1841| [45] [She was so quiet, yet so sad.]
186: 1846| [45] [He wanted to put an end to those tears.]
187: 1851| [45] [And what he had felt back then hadn't changed since.]
188: 1931| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 1934| [45] ["... In that case."]
190: 1960| [47] [Yuuri]
191: 1963| [45] ["Huh...?"]
192: 1968| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 1971| [45] ["If you don't want to go home... then let's go somewhere, just the two of us."]
194: 1997| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 2000| [45] ["..."]
196: 2005| [45] [Natsuhiko gripped Yuuri's hand.]
197: 2028| [47] [Yuuri]
198: 2029| [45] ["..."]
199: 2034| [45] [Yuuri said nothing.]
200: 2039| [45] [Her face was soaked with tears. He couldn't tell what she was thinking.]
201: 2044| [45] [But even so--]
202: 2049| [45] [Yuuri gripped Natsuhiko's hand back.]
203: 2129| [45] [--He could feel her warmth through the softness of her palm.]
204: 2134| [45] [As Natsuhiko felt that warmth, he thought to himself.]
205: 2139| [45] [He swore that no matter what happened, he'd protect her for sure--]
