  0:  212| [55] [√Before Chapter 2]
  1:  220| [45] [--Natsuhiko took a quick look at his watch and realized it was already past 8 PM.]
  2:  262| [45] [He pulled himself together and hopped back through the entryway into his home.]
  3:  402| [45] [In the living room, Natsuhiko saw no sign of Salyu. Instead, he found Yuuri quietly reading a book.]
  4:  496| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  499| [45] ["Ah, welcome back, Hikorin. Did you walk Mashiron home properly?"]
  6:  507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  510| [45] ["Hmm? Oh, yeah, I did."]
  8:  536| [47] [Yuuri]
  9:  539| [45] ["Okay. Good, good."]
 10:  544| [45] [Yuuri's casual tone of voice was a relief to Natsuhiko.]
 11:  549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  550| [45] [(A lot happened today... but it's a huge relief that Yuuri's the same as always.)]
 13:  555| [45] [All his worries and weariness were washed away with one look at Yuuri's smile.]
 14:  574| [45] [Natsuhiko returned her smile and sank into the sofa.]
 15:  584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  587| [45] ["How'd you spend your day today, Yuuri?"]
 17:  613| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  616| [45] ["Same as yesterday~ I did a little knitting and read two books from a series."]
 19:  624| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  627| [45] ["A series? What kind of story is it?"]
 21:  653| [47] [Yuuri]
 22:  656| [45] ["Let's see... it's a heartfelt series of romance novels."]
 23:  682| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  685| [45] ["It's written in the format of the protagonist writing down his own memories of the past..."]
 25:  711| [47] [Yuuri]
 26:  714| [45] ["The opening line was quite impressive. 'Memories are ambiguous'. It really drew me in."]
 27:  722| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  725| [45] ["Memories are ambiguous?"]
 29:  751| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  754| [45] ["Yeah. According to the protagonist himself... 'People tend to rewrite their own memories unconsciously.'"]
 31:  762| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  765| [45] ["'And so even this story itself is not necessarily the truth.'"]
 33:  791| [47] [Yuuri]
 34:  794| [45] ["Isn't it interesting for a romance novel to begin like that?"]
 35:  802| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  805| [45] ["Yeah, though it sounds a tad perplexing."]
 37:  831| [47] [Yuuri]
 38:  834| [45] ["But you know, as you continue the story, you learn that it really is like that."]
 39:  842| [47] [Yuuri]
 40:  845| [45] ["Memories are never reliable. You could end up recalling something completely different depending on your current situation and mental state."]
 41:  853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  856| [45] ["Huh, does that really happen?"]
 43:  882| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  885| [45] ["Of course it does. For example, let's say someone was deeply in love."]
 45:  911| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  914| [45] ["As long as that love endured, their memory of their lover might be radiant... but if that love were to end, those memories could turn bitter, couldn't they?"]
 47:  922| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  925| [45] ["Hmm... true, that does sound plausible. I've never experienced it myself, so I can't say for sure, though."]
 49:  951| [47] [Yuuri]
 50:  954| [45] ["It's not just romance, though. The same happens in casual, everyday events, don't you think?"]
 51:  980| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  983| [45] ["Sometimes you can mix up things that you said with things that someone else said, right?"]
 53:  991| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  994| [45] ["Ah, I know that feeling. Mashiro and I often argue whether I said this or she said that."]
 55: 1020| [47] [Yuuri]
 56: 1023| [45] ["Right? And so eventually, the protagonist of this story becomes aware that each time he recalls his own past, his memories get subtly rewritten."]
 57: 1049| [47] [Yuuri]
 58: 1052| [45] ["'Even if the truth doesn't change, feelings do.' 'There is no absolute truth.'%N'The past is a haze of ambiguity.'"]
 59: 1078| [47] [Yuuri]
 60: 1081| [45] ["So not even the protagonist himself knows which memories are real. But--"]
 61: 1089| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1092| [45] ["But?"]
 63: 1118| [47] [Yuuri]
 64: 1121| [45] ["That's all I've read so far. Saving the rest for tomorrow."]
 65: 1129| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1132| [45] ["I-I see."]
 67: 1137| [45] [Even Yuuri was confusing him now. Natsuhiko's shoulders drooped.]
 68: 1142| [45] [She softly smiled and continued.]
 69: 1168| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1171| [45] ["... But still, even though we don't know the end of the story, it feels like a hopeful one, doesn't it?"]
 71: 1179| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1182| [45] ["Hopeful because memories are ambiguous?"]
 73: 1208| [47] [Yuuri]
 74: 1211| [45] ["Yeah. Memories may change, but even so..."]
 75: 1219| [47] [Yuuri]
 76: 1222| [45] ["Wouldn't it be nice if one day, all memories, sweet and bitter ones alike, could change into something beautiful?"]
 77: 1230| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1233| [45] ["..."]
 79: 1238| [45] [Her words sounded more than just a simple impression of a novel.]
 80: 1243| [45] [But her expression was unexpectedly calm-- which relieved Natsuhiko as he answered.]
 81: 1251| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1254| [45] ["You're right... That really would be nice."]
 83: 1280| [47] [Yuuri]
 84: 1283| [45] ["I know, right?"]
 85: 1291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1294| [45] ["But still, Yuuri, you really like talking about stuff like 'memories', don't you?"]
 87: 1302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1305| [45] ["You've talked about a novel like that before too, haven't you? One where all the characters had completely different testimonials of what happened during the same event."]
 89: 1331| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1334| [45] ["Yeah, I love that topic."]
 91: 1360| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1363| [45] ["Just a tiny change in memory could make you and someone else have completely different impressions of the same thing."]
 93: 1368| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Natsuhiko noticed that he and Mashiro had completely contrary impressions of Salyu.]
 94: 1373| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1374| [45] [(That reminds me, I haven't directly asked Yuuri about her yet, have I?)]
 96: 1379| [45] [And with that thought in mind, Natsuhiko asked her with a sigh.]
 97: 1387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1390| [45] ["... Say, Yuuri. Since we're talking about impressions and all..."]
 99: 1416| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1419| [45] ["Huh, what's up?"]
101: 1427| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1430| [45] ["What do you think... about Salyu?"]
103: 1456| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1459| [45] ["Huh, what's this all of a sudden? Hikorin, do you have something against Salyu?"]
105: 1467| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1470| [45] ["No, nothing like that... It's just... I was wondering if you were okay with us suddenly getting a new addition to the household."]
107: 1496| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1499| [45] ["Hmm, I'm okay, but... I'm more worried about Salyu. She seems nervous to me."]
109: 1507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1510| [45] ["Huh? You think so too, Yuuri...?"]
111: 1584| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1587| [45] ["Hey, Hikorin. Try to be friends with Salyu. Like how you became friends with me."]
113: 1595| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1598| [45] ["Like how I became friends with you...?"]
115: 1603| [45] [That was a story from long, long ago.]
116: 1608| [45] [Natsuhiko's brain became filled with memories of those days.]
117: 1613| [45] [He felt as if time itself were melting away as he recalled the memory of the day he and Yuuri first met--]
118: 1779| [55] [√Before Chapter 2]
119: 1911| [45] [--That day was nearly ten years ago.]
120: 1916| [45] [On that day alone, all of Natsuhiko's playmates were busy, including Mashiro.]
121: 1924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1927| [45] ["Tch, what a waste of a Sunday..."]
123: 1932| [45] [Natsuhiko went and played by himself in the park, bored.]
124: 1937| [45] [And that was when he came across Yuuri, who was doing the same.]
125: 2024| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 2027| [45] ["... *sob*..."]
127: 2032| [45] [For some reason, tears were spilling down her face.]
128: 2037| [45] [She was so quiet, yet so sad.]
129: 2042| [45] [Upon seeing her, Natsuhiko asked,]
130: 2095| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2098| [45] ["Hey, hey, why are you crying?"]
132: 2124| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 2127| [45] ["Hweh...?"]
134: 2153| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 2156| [45] ["... U-um... who are you?"]
136: 2164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2167| [45] ["I'm Natsuhiko."]
138: 2193| [47] [Yuuri]
139: 2196| [45] ["... Natsuhiko?"]
140: 2204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2207| [45] ["You're 'Yuuri Kotono', right? Your family just moved in nearby."]
142: 2233| [47] [Yuuri]
143: 2236| [45] ["... Yeah."]
144: 2244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2247| [45] ["Let's be friends. We live in the same neighborhood, after all."]
146: 2290| [45] [Yuuri seemed a little surprised, but she nodded before long.]
147: 2416| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2417| [45] [(Why was Yuuri crying that day, exactly...?)]
149: 2422| [45] [He had the feeling she was probably sad because she couldn't make any friends after moving.]
150: 2427| [45] [But Natsuhiko and Yuuri soon became friends and often played together after that.]
151: 2432| [45] [He was really glad that he had called out to her back then.]
152: 2516| [45] [--And for these past ten years, he always had been.]
153: 2521| [45] [Once he had remembered that day, he finally became self-aware of the reason why he had his guard up around Salyu.]
154: 2572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2573| [45] [(I see... So that's what it was.)]
156: 2578| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 2579| [45] [(I'm afraid of Mom and Salyu trying to change my current life.)]
158: 2584| [45] [This home was a place of peace for Natsuhiko.]
159: 2589| [45] [A safe haven from all the evils that threatened to break Yuuri's fragile heart.]
160: 2640| [45] [Natsuhiko had already almost lost that refuge once, only barely managing to recover it.%NHe'd been fervently protecting it ever since.]
161: 2645| [45] [He didn't like the feeling of an outsider stepping foot into his sanctuary.]
162: 2650| [45] [Which was why he was putting such an emphasis on Yuuri's feelings in the present situation.]
163: 2669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2672| [45] ["Say, Yuuri... You don't have any objections to Salyu living here, do you?"]
165: 2698| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 2701| [45] ["Nope~ What about you, Hikorin?"]
167: 2719| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2722| [45] ["Personally, I don't mind. But I want to be on your side."]
169: 2748| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 2751| [45] ["I'm perfectly fine with it."]
171: 2759| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2762| [45] ["Are you sure? You can be honest with me, okay?"]
173: 2788| [47] [Yuuri]
174: 2791| [45] ["I'm sure~ Hikorin, you're such a worrywart."]
175: 2799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2802| [45] ["I-I see..."]
177: 2807| [45] [Yuuri turned Natsuhiko's words from yesterday against him.]
178: 2815| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2818| [45] ["I guess we're both a couple of worrywarts, then..."]
180: 2844| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2847| [45] ["I'm glad you care about me and all, but why does it bother you that much?"]
182: 2855| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2858| [45] ["To be honest, I'm... confused... That girl says a bunch of strange things."]
184: 2888| [47] [Yuuri]
185: 2891| [45] ["Salyu's super cute. Are you sure you're not just nervous to be living under the same roof as a girl like her?"]
186: 2899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 2902| [45] ["Well, yeah, normally that might be something to be happy about, but..."]
188: 2907| [45] [True enough, Salyu's facial features were well-proportioned like that of a doll.]
189: 2912| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2913| [45] [(Under different circumstances, sure, I may have been happy about it, but still...)]
191: 2939| [47] [Yuuri]
192: 2942| [45] ["... You're unhappy?"]
193: 2950| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2953| [45] ["No... It's just... something's just been bugging me."]
195: 2961| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2964| [45] ["That girl says a bunch of strange things."]
197: 2975| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2978| [45] ["To be honest, I'm a little confused... That girl says a bunch of strange things."]
199: 3004| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 3007| [45] ["Strange things? Like what?"]
201: 3015| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 3018| [45] ["She said she's here to protect me... Doesn't that seem kinda backwards to you?"]
203: 3041| [45] [At those words, Yuuri made an odd smile--]
204: 3068| [45] [And then suddenly spoke in a quiet voice.]
205: 3076| [47] [Yuuri]
206: 3079| [45] ["--Hikorin. You shouldn't assume the worst of people."]
207: 3087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 3090| [45] ["Huh?"]
209: 3116| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 3119| [45] ["I'm sure Salyu's being honest."]
211: 3130| [45] [Those words startled Natsuhiko.]
212: 3181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 3182| [45] [(What...? Something's different about Yuuri... Just like yesterday...)]
214: 3187| [45] [She suddenly spoke with a serious look on her face.]
215: 3192| [45] [She never used to do that in the past. She seemed almost like an entirely different person.]
216: 3226| [45] [Yuuri continued, staring straight into Natsuhiko's confused eyes.]
217: 3234| [47] [Yuuri]
218: 3237| [45] ["When Salyu was assigned to protect you, she had finally found a role for herself."]
219: 3263| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 3266| [45] ["That was something she always, always wanted..."]
221: 3274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3277| [45] ["Wha..."]
223: 3285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3288| [45] ["... Yuuri, why do you sound like you've known Salyu from somewhere before?"]
225: 3296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3299| [45] ["Don't tell me you've known each other from the start?"]
227: 3304| [45] [If that were the case, then he'd easily understand why she wasn't at all disturbed by Salyu's sudden move in.]
228: 3327| [45] [But Yuuri silently shook her head.]
229: 3353| [47] [Yuuri]
230: 3356| [45] ["No. I only met her just now, in the same way you did, Hikorin."]
231: 3430| [47] [Yuuri]
232: 3433| [45] ["But I can tell."]
233: 3441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3444| [45] ["... How?"]
235: 3470| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 3473| [45] ["... How indeed?"]
237: 3499| [47] [Yuuri]
238: 3502| [45] ["But I'm sure Salyu is on your side, Hikorin."]
239: 3517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3520| [45] ["...?"]
241: 3528| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 3531| [45] ["You can't just suddenly say something like that and expect me to accept it that easily."]
243: 3557| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 3560| [45] ["... Nothing can change your mind?"]
245: 3568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 3571| [45] ["I mean, we haven't even known her for two days, remember? How can you tell me she's on my side...?"]
247: 3579| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 3582| [45] ["Isn't it just baseless conjecture to assume she's without any malice or hostility?"]
249: 3605| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 3606| [45] ["..."]
251: 3632| [47] [Yuuri]
252: 3635| [45] ["... Tell me, Hikorin. Is there nothing that can change your mind?"]
253: 3719| [45] [Natsuhiko averted his eyes from Yuuri's pointed stare.]
254: 3729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3732| [45] ["... I wouldn't be so dead set if Salyu hadn't come stepping into this house on her own."]
256: 3740| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3743| [45] ["I'm just worried about you, Yuuri."]
258: 3751| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3754| [45] ["When I think of the possibility that Salyu might cause something bad to happen to you, I just..."]
260: 3780| [47] [Yuuri]
261: 3783| [45] ["... Is that why you can't accept her?"]
262: 3788| [47] [Natsuhiko]
263: 3789| [45] ["..."]
264: 3794| [45] [Natsuhiko's silence brought a downcast expression to Yuuri's face.]
265: 3820| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 3823| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Hikorin. I'm sorry I made you worry about that."]
267: 3849| [47] [Yuuri]
268: 3852| [45] ["But please... open your heart to others, at least a little."]
269: 3860| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 3863| [45] ["... I'm giving it a shot."]
271: 3871| [47] [Yuuri]
272: 3874| [45] ["No, what you're doing now isn't enough."]
273: 3882| [47] [Yuuri]
274: 3885| [45] ["You need to open up your heart more... or I think you yourself will suffer."]
275: 3910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 3913| [45] ["Huh? Why's that?"]
277: 3939| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 3942| [45] ["Because, Hikorin, right now--"]
279: 3968| [47] [Yuuri]
280: 3971| [45] ["You'll be in grave danger if you don't cooperate with them. Especially Salyu."]
281: 3985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
282: 3988| [45] ["!!"]
283: 3993| [45] [The moment Yuuri said that,]
284: 4038| [45] [The scenery changed before Natsuhiko's very eyes.]
285: 4168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
286: 4171| [45] ["On my side...?"]
287: 4179| [47] [Natsuhiko]
288: 4182| [45] ["It's... hard to believe that so suddenly."]
289: 4208| [47] [Yuuri]
290: 4211| [45] ["I guess that's true..."]
291: 4216| [45] [Yuuri smiled sadly as she said so.]
292: 4224| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 4227| [45] ["Both you and I have lived in fear of change, after all."]
294: 4253| [47] [Yuuri]
295: 4256| [45] ["But one day... we have to accept it."]
296: 4282| [47] [Yuuri]
297: 4285| [45] ["Or else we'll be trapped in the past forever..."]
298: 4291| [45] [She fell silent.]
299: 4302| [45] [The only sound in the still room was the ticking of the hands on the wall clock.]
300: 4377| [47] [Natsuhiko]
301: 4378| [45] [(... Clock?)]
302: 4384| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
303: 4389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 4390| [45] [(That's right... yesterday... when Yuuri started talking with this tone of voice--)]
305: 4395| [45] [He looked at his watch, only to find it had broken before he had realized it.]
306: 4400| [47] [Natsuhiko]
307: 4401| [45] [(No way...?)]
308: 4613| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at his watch-- and stared in disbelief.]
309: 4618| [45] [The dial had cracked.]
310: 4623| [45] [The hands were stopped, and the date displayed was days into the future.]
311: 4687| [47] ["9/16"]
312: 4695| [47] ["6:19"]
313: 4726| [45] [Early morning, five days from today--]
314: 4734| [47] [Natsuhiko]
315: 4737| [45] ["Wh... why?"]
316: 4837| [45] [Yuuri continued despite Natsuhiko's terror.]
317: 4863| [47] [Yuuri]
318: 4866| [45] ["... Hey, Hikorin. No matter how many things make no sense around you... No matter how many things seem suspicious..."]
319: 4892| [47] [Yuuri]
320: 4895| [45] ["No matter what's the truth and what's a lie, you should be in the company of those with good intentions, shouldn't you?"]
321: 4903| [47] [Yuuri]
322: 4906| [45] ["So don't distrust those around you."]
323: 4932| [47] [Yuuri]
324: 4935| [45] ["... If you must distrust someone, then distrust me."]
325: 5036| [45] [And with that, Yuuri turned around,]
326: 5055| [45] [and left the living room.]
327: 5065| [47] [Natsuhiko]
328: 5068| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...?"]
329: 5076| [47] [Natsuhiko]
330: 5079| [45] ["Wait, what do you mean?"]
331: 5084| [45] [Natsuhiko chased after Yuuri, placed his hand on the living room door--]
332: 5137| [45] [And opened it.]
