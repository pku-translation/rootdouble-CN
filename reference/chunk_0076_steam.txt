  1:   84| [45] [Watase headed for the stairwell first after he parted with Kazami.]
  2:   89| [45] [His goal was to find what'd caused that explosion earlier.]
  3:  133| [45] [However--]
  4:  138| [47] [Watase]
  5:  139| [45] [(There's nothing here...)]
  6:  144| [45] [He searched the stairwell as much as he could, but there didn't appear to be anything explosive in there.]
  7:  149| [45] [The fire extinguisher had sent shivers down his spine when he'd seen it earlier for some reason, so he'd checked it out--]
  8:  154| [45] [But it had already been smashed up into pieces, none of which held any clues.]
  9:  159| [47] [Watase]
 10:  160| [45] [(Besides, why would a fire cause an extinguisher to blow up anyway...?)]
 11:  165| [47] [Watase]
 12:  166| [45] [(... Then maybe there was a gas leak or something...?)]
 13:  171| [45] [But without his knowledge of fire investigations, Watase didn't know any more than that.]
 14:  176| [47] [Watase]
 15:  177| [45] [(It's bugging me, but I don't have enough time for this...)]
 16:  182| [45] [He decided to give up for the time being and continue searching elsewhere.]
 17:  283| [45] [--Area 2, inner ring, B2--]
 18:  288| [45] [Watase immediately began his search of the block.]
 19:  293| [45] [Only Kazami and Jun had searched the place the first time through. This was also where their makeshift base was set up.]
 20:  298| [45] [It had been ages since anyone had last checked the area out.]
 21:  303| [47] [Watase]
 22:  304| [45] [(There's also enough room to believe that the survivors are constantly on the move...)]
 23:  309| [45] [Watase quickly carried out his search with those thoughts in mind--]
 24:  355| [47] [Watase]
 25:  358| [45] ["Hmm...?"]
 26:  363| [45] [But a nameplate labelling one of the rooms caught Watase's eye.]
 27:  369| [45] ["Reference Room".]
 28:  374| [45] [A room he'd never visited before.]
 29:  379| [47] [Watase]
 30:  380| [45] [(Could there be a hint about an escape route in here...?)]
 31:  385| [45] [Ukita had just warned him not to go poking his nose in too deeply, but this wasn't the kind of situation that allowed him to heed that warning.]
 32:  390| [45] [Watase headed into the room with that thought in mind.]
 33:  463| [45] [It was a small room about 5 meters in width.]
 34:  468| [45] [That entire space was almost completely filled with steel bookshelf upon steel bookshelf.]
 35:  473| [45] [There was a switch attached to each shelf, meaning it was most likely a movable type of bookcase.]
 36:  478| [47] [Watase]
 37:  479| [45] [(Yuuri's... not here, huh.)]
 38:  539| [45] [--Area 2, inner ring, B2.]
 39:  544| [45] [Watase was now directly opposite of Area 5, where he and the others had split up.]
 40:  549| [45] [He had half expected to find Kazami's team wandering around here--%Nbut they were nowhere to be seen.]
 41:  554| [47] [Watase]
 42:  555| [45] [(I sure hope they didn't get into any weird sort of trouble like we did...)]
 43:  560| [45] [If he maintained his assumption that Jun's injury had been no accident, then it was only natural for him to worry about the others.]
 44:  565| [47] [Watase]
 45:  566| [45] [(No, it's okay. Tachibana's more than capable of dealing with whatever's thrown her way.)]
 46:  571| [45] [Watase shook his head and resumed his search.]
 47:  576| [45] [Only Kazami and Jun had searched the place the first time through. This was also where their makeshift base was set up.]
 48:  581| [45] [It had been ages since anyone had last checked the area out.]
 49:  586| [47] [Watase]
 50:  587| [45] [(There's also more than enough room to believe that the survivors are constantly on the move...)]
 51:  592| [45] [Watase quickly carried out his search with those thoughts in mind--]
 52:  638| [47] [Watase]
 53:  641| [45] ["Hmm...?"]
 54:  646| [45] [But a nameplate labelling one of the rooms caught Watase's eye.]
 55:  652| [45] ["Reference Room".]
 56:  657| [45] [A room he'd never visited before.]
 57:  662| [47] [Watase]
 58:  663| [45] [(Could there be a hint about an escape route in here...?)]
 59:  668| [45] [Watase headed into the room with that thought in mind.]
 60:  741| [45] [It was a small room about 5 meters in width.]
 61:  746| [45] [That entire space was almost completely filled with steel bookshelf upon steel bookshelf.]

 64:  757| [45] [(Yuuri's... not here, huh.)]
 65:  817| [45] [--Area 2, inner ring, B2.]
 66:  822| [45] [Watase was now directly opposite of Area 5, where he and the others had split up.]
 67:  884| [47] [Ena]
 68:  887| [45] ["I was expecting that we'd be regrouping with Lieutenant Tachibana's team right about here, but..."]
 69:  895| [47] [Watase]
 70:  898| [45] ["They're not here, huh?"]
 71:  924| [47] [Ena]
 72:  927| [45] ["Maybe something bad happened to them like it did with us..."]
 73:  935| [47] [Watase]
 74:  938| [45] ["Oh come on, Tachibana and Moribe will be fine. Those two wouldn't let a little accident or two get the better of them."]
 75:  964| [47] [Ena]
 76:  967| [45] ["True... Then we should search the place before them while we're at it, don't you think?"]
 77: 1010| [45] [Watase nodded and walked off with Ena.]
 78: 1015| [45] [Only Kazami and Jun had searched the place the first time through. This was also where their makeshift base was set up.]
 79: 1020| [45] [It had been ages since anyone had last checked the area out.]
 80: 1025| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1026| [45] [(There's also enough room to believe that the survivors are constantly on the move...)]
 82: 1031| [45] [Watase quickly carried out his search with those thoughts in mind--]
 83: 1077| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1080| [45] ["Hmm...?"]
 85: 1085| [45] [But a nameplate labelling one of the rooms caught Watase's eye.]
 86: 1112| [47] [Ena]
 87: 1115| [45] ["This is the... 'Reference Room'?"]
 88: 1120| [45] [That was indeed what the nameplate said.]
 89: 1128| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1131| [45] ["Could there be a hint about an escape route in this room...?"]
 91: 1157| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1160| [45] ["Maybe. Let's go take a look for ourselves."]
 93: 1193| [45] [Ena said that, then opened the door.]
 94: 1266| [45] [It was a small room about 5 meters in width.]
 95: 1271| [45] [That entire space was almost completely filled with steel bookshelf upon steel bookshelf.]
 96: 1276| [45] [There was a switch attached to each shelf, meaning it was most likely a movable type of bookcase.]
 97: 1302| [47] [Ena]
 98: 1305| [45] ["Doesn't look like... there's anyone here either, does it?"]
 99: 1313| [47] [Watase]
100: 1316| [45] ["Yeah, it doesn't..."]
101: 1355| [45] [Once he'd confirmed that, Watase's eyes turned to the bookshelf.]
102: 1360| [45] [A crammed line of books and essays were sitting there.]
103: 1365| [45] ["An Introduction to the Informational Field Theory/Author: Miyoko Tenkawa"]
104: 1370| [45] ["Elementary Particles, Information, and Consciousness/Author: Miyoko Tenkawa"]
105: 1375| [45] ["ESP Synchronization Hypothesis/Author: Antoine Courbet  Translator: Miyoko Tenkawa"]
106: 1380| [45] ["Cerebrum: Labyrinth of Physiology/Author: Ryoken Kashiwagi"]
107: 1385| [45] ["Unbinding from Pseudoscience: The Future and Prospects of Parapsychology/Author: Koki Sumida"]
108: 1390| [45] ["Before Crime * After Days/Author: Chikage Sonomura"]
109: 1395| [45] ["Particles, the Mind, and the Brain/Author: Shuuya Eriguchi"]
110: 1400| [45] [Watase looked at all of their titles.]
111: 1405| [47] [Watase]
112: 1406| [45] [(... I don't get them.)]
113: 1411| [45] [Watase had no knowledge of science in his current state, so he hadn't the slightest clue what they contained.]
114: 1416| [45] [Now that he thought about it, the two main themes researched at the facility were "nuclear power" and "biology".]
115: 1421| [45] [Either way, all he knew was that there were a lot of biology-related books in there.]
116: 1426| [45] [But there was a familiar name amongst all the authors listed.]
117: 1431| [47] [Watase]
118: 1432| [45] [("Miyoko Tenkawa"...)]
119: 1437| [45] [If his memory served him right, that was the name of Natsuhiko Tenkawa's mother.]
120: 1442| [45] [And when he saw those books-- a strange anxiety welled up in Watase's chest.]
121: 1447| [47] [Watase]
122: 1448| [45] [(!?)]
123: 1453| [45] [Watase was puzzled. Why would looking at books make him feel anxious?]
124: 1458| [47] [Watase]
125: 1459| [45] [(I know this isn't the time to be doing this, but--)]
126: 1464| [45] [Watase couldn't go against his feelings. So he took one of the books and flipped through it.]
127: 1502| [45] ["An Introduction to the Informational Field Theory"]
128: 1505| [85] [　]
129: 1508| [45] [<Foreword>]
130: 1511| [45] [In modern physics, all phenomena that shape the natural world can be explained with four fundamental forces.]
131: 1514| [45] [But there are phenomena such as the accelerating universe and so on that cannot be explained by these four fundamental forces alone.]
132: 1517| [45] [It has become clear from recent high precision observation that the rate at which the universe expands accelerates with time.]
133: 1520| [45] [It is from that survey that the theory of an unknown energy known as dark energy (repulsive gravity) was born.]
134: 1523| [45] [But if dark energy supposedly does exist, then what is it?]
135: 1526| [45] [Various conjectures have been conceived, but they are all merely speculation.]
136: 1530| [85] [ %N]
137: 1533| [45] [Thus I continued to look into that force from the perspective of an elementary particle physicist, and formulated a hypothesis:]
138: 1536| [45] [Could it be "information"?]
139: 1539| [45] [If a fifth fundamental force does indeed exist, there is a high possibility that it is in fact "information".]
140: 1542| [45] [I used a numerical formula to express the equivalence of information volume and energy,]
141: 1545| [45] [then after deriving its value, I discovered that said value completely matched up with the rate of universal expansion.]
142: 1548| [45] [In other words--]
143: 1576| [47] [Watase]
144: 1577| [45] [(...???)]
145: 1582| [45] [Watase had no clue what he was reading.]
146: 1587| [47] [Watase]
147: 1588| [45] [(Fifth fundamental force? Information? Dark energy? The hell's all that...?)]
148: 1593| [45] [He still had no clue why he'd felt such intense anxiety from this book.]
149: 1598| [47] [Watase]
150: 1599| [45] [(Was it just my imagination...?)]
151: 1604| [45] [Watase wondered that as he flipped through the pages and kept reading.]
152: 1642| [45] [--The following conjecture is based off this theory.]
153: 1645| [85] [　]
154: 1648| [45] [* Even information itself can exist independently, and can possibly interact (be conveyed) without the use of other forces as an intermediary.]
155: 1651| [45] [* For example, since a human's thoughts are a type of "information", they can communicate with others without the need for those thoughts to be converted into another medium (such as electrical signals).]
156: 1654| [85] [　]
157: 1657| [45] [This is a somewhat extreme expression I am using here, but this is the gist of the "informational field hypothesis".]
158: 1660| [45] [The "informational field" is the place where "information" operates (as the fifth fundamental force/energy).]
159: 1663| [45] [If we are to consider this by using the human brain as an example, the "informational field" generated from thought information may in fact be what we call the "consciousness".]
160: 1673| [45] [It is still unclear as of this point as to what the process that creates a "consciousness" entails.]
161: 1676| [45] [All we do know is that a consciousness is generated inside the brain when]
162: 1679| [45] ["countless memories = fragments of information" and "electric signals running through the synapses" interact.]
163: 1682| [45] [However, another conjecture can be formed when you think on the basis of this hypothesis.]
164: 1685| [45] [If information can exist independently, then that means a consciousness does not necessarily have to form in a brain.]
165: 1688| [45] [If a fixed amount of information gathers in one spot and interacts with each other, a consciousness can be born right then and there.]
166: 1691| [45] [Furthermore, if information can be controlled--]
167: 1694| [45] [Then it should also be possible to artificially "create a consciousness".]
168: 1720| [47] [Watase]
169: 1721| [45] [(... Yeah, this isn't making any sense to me.)]
170: 1726| [47] [Watase]
171: 1727| [45] [(What kind of research does this Miyoko Tenkawa person do...?)]
172: 1732| [45] [She'd called herself an "elementary particle physicist", but he got the impression this research had more to do with biology.]
173: 1737| [47] [Watase]
174: 1738| [45] [(But to "create a consciousness"...)]
175: 1743| [47] [Watase]
176: 1744| [45] [(Why would anyone want to do that...?)]
177: 1749| [47] [Watase]
178: 1750| [45] [(What does research involving creating a consciousness have to do with nuclear power and biology...?)]
179: 1755| [45] [He wasn't sure why, but he felt a faint, ominous sensation.]
180: 1760| [45] [Despite that, he continued to read more of the book--]
181: 1765| [45] [And then gasped.]
182: 1803| [45] [... In conclusion, the various theories laid out in the "informational field hypothesis" have yet to be proven.]
183: 1806| [45] [But this thesis has been reappraised in a form I never once expected.]
184: 1809| [45] [This is all due to a rapid yet drastic change that has recently swept society.]
185: 1812| [45] [That change is the manifestation of "BC".]
186: 1841| [47] [Watase]
187: 1844| [45] ["BC...!?"]
188: 1849| [45] [Come to think of it, Ena had mentioned it before.]
189: 1854| [45] [She'd said that it wasn't all that rare for there to be people who could use telepathy these days.]
190: 1859| [45] [Watase continued to read.]
191: 1897| [45] [The ability known as "BC" has been widely acknowledged by society in the last few years.]
192: 1900| [45] [It can be said that this has resulted in mindsets towards the nature of "information" and ways of communication to undergo tremendous changes.]
193: 1903| [45] [We have also discovered countless people who possess this ability that we never would have conceived as feasible mere years ago.]
194: 1906| [45] [The abilities of "BC" can generally be classified into two groups.]
195: 1909| [85] [　]
196: 1912| [45] [The first one is "telepathy", the ability to directly send your voice to another's mind.]
197: 1915| [45] [The other is "empathy", the ability to read the voice of another's mind.]
198: 1918| [85] [　]
199: 1921| [45] [By describing these two abilities with these extremely coherent terms,%Nwe can explain them separately.]
200: 1931| [45] [When BC is used, the user's "thought information" is not converted into another medium.]
201: 1934| [45] [They communicate with their target by sending that thought information directly into their target's brain by using elementary particles as an intermediary.]
202: 1937| [45] [This matches up with what I proposed in my "informational field hypothesis".]
203: 1940| [45] [Two completely unrelated fields of study-- parapsychology and elementary particle physics-- are connected by BC.]
204: 1950| [45] [Furthermore, while telepathy practitioners are still few, empathy practitioners are even rarer.]
205: 1953| [45] [But the true number of users is not what's important here.]
206: 1956| [45] [It's the fact that an ability such as empathy exists.]
207: 1959| [45] [And also the fact that the existence of "information" known as the "voice of the mind" can be observed by others despite previously being unknown to those other than the thinkers themselves.]
208: 1962| [45] [This is indeed the first and biggest paradigm shift of the 21st century.]
209: 1988| [47] [Watase]
210: 1989| [45] [(Wh... what!?)]
211: 1994| [45] [The words laid out before him were almost unbelievable.]
212: 1999| [45] [He'd already heard about the ability to directly send one's voice to another's mind.]
213: 2004| [45] [The problem was the other ability.]
214: 2014| [47] [Watase]
215: 2017| [45] ["'The ability to read another's mind'...!?"]
216: 2022| [45] [He then remembered what Ena had told him earlier.]
217: 2131| [47] [Ena]
218: 2134| [45] ["It is essentially the ability to mutually communicate your ideas to people far away.%NNothing more, and nothing less."]
219: 2193| [47] [Watase]
220: 2194| [45] [(I see, so when she said "mutually communicate"... she didn't just mean sending your thoughts, but also reading other people's thoughts too!)]
221: 2199| [47] [Watase]
222: 2200| [45] [(Then the stuff in this book isn't just some pipe dream--!)]
223: 2227| [47] [Watase]
224: 2230| [45] ["T-Teach... is what this book says for real?"]
225: 2256| [47] [Ena]
226: 2259| [45] ["Huh?"]
227: 2264| [45] [Ena took a look through the pages.]
228: 2272| [47] [Watase]
229: 2275| [45] ["Is this 'empathy' thing... real?"]
230: 2301| [47] [Ena]
231: 2304| [45] ["Y-yes. I didn't mention it?"]
232: 2312| [47] [Ena]
233: 2315| [45] ["I told you that 'BC was the ability to mutually communicate your ideas to people far away', right?"]
234: 2341| [47] [Ena]
235: 2344| [45] ["I didn't just mean that you could send your mind's voice to another, but also to read theirs."]
236: 2352| [47] [Watase]
237: 2355| [45] ["...!"]
238: 2440| [45] [Watase looked at the bookshelf in shock to find that many of them had the phrase "BC" in the titles.]
239: 2445| [45] [Apparently it really was considered a completely normal thing.]
240: 2450| [45] [Though there were very few of them, there were indeed people out there who could "read others' minds".]
241: 2455| [45] [Just then-- Watase finally realized the truth behind his anxiety.]
242: 2460| [47] [Watase]
243: 2461| [45] [(I see, so I...)]
244: 2466| [47] [Watase]
245: 2467| [45] [(... was scared of this "empathy" ability...!?)]
246: 2472| [45] [He didn't know exactly why.]
247: 2477| [45] [Maybe he'd had a really frightening experience with it before he'd lost his memories.]
248: 2482| [45] [But even if that weren't the case-- he didn't feel like there could possibly be anyone who was okay with having their mind read by someone else.]
249: 2487| [47] [Watase]
250: 2488| [45] [(No, what if, at this very moment...)]
251: 2493| [47] [Watase]
252: 2494| [45] [(... someone is reading my mind and can hear my fear of having my mind read--!?)]
253: 2499| [45] [--Watase's body shook violently in the face of that abrupt thought.]
254: 2608| [47] [Jun]
255: 2611| [45] ["And though a lot of BC users are kids for some reason, adult BC users are as rare as a hen's teeth."]
256: 2672| [45] [If he were to trust what Jun said, then that probably meant none of the "adults" in the group were Communicators.]
257: 2677| [47] [Watase]
258: 2678| [45] [(But what about the "children"...?)]
259: 2683| [45] [Could Natsuhiko read minds? Mashiro? Salyu?]
260: 2688| [45] [And-- what about Yuuri?]
261: 2695| [47] [Watase]
262: 2696| [45] [(... Teach said that Natsuhiko and his friends could use telepathy.)]
263: 2701| [47] [Watase]
264: 2702| [45] [(Then isn't it naturally possible they can use empathy too...?)]
265: 2728| [45] [Watase couldn't hold his question back.]
266: 2736| [47] [Watase]
267: 2739| [45] ["... Teach, lemme ask you one more thing."]
268: 2747| [47] [Watase]
269: 2750| [45] ["Can those kids use empathy?"]
270: 2776| [47] [Ena]
271: 2779| [45] ["Huh...? No, they can't."]
272: 2805| [47] [Ena]
273: 2808| [45] ["Ms. Toba is an expert at using telepathy, though. And the other two are bad at BC to begin with..."]
274: 2813| [47] [Watase]
275: 2814| [45] [(Is that true...?)]
276: 2822| [47] [Ena]
277: 2825| [45] ["Hey, is that relevant in any way?"]
278: 2830| [45] [Watase didn't answer Ena's puzzled question, and retreated back to his thoughts.]
279: 2873| [45] [Now that he thought about it, several suspicious events had occured.]
280: 2903| [45] [Why had Yuuri run away from the group?]
281: 2941| [45] [Why had Salyu fled from the group back then?]
282: 3027| [45] [Why hadn't they found the three survivors yet?]
283: 3244| [47] [Watase]
284: 3245| [45] [(If those kids can read people's minds...)]
285: 3250| [47] [Watase]
286: 3251| [45] [(And when you take into account they've been running from us... then maybe one of us hates them and they know it...!)]
287: 3256| [45] [He didn't want to believe it, but it all added up.]
288: 3261| [45] [--If that were the case, then who was the one who hated them?]
289: 3266| [45] [It wasn't Watase, at the very least. He knew that better than anyone.]
290: 3271| [47] [Watase]
291: 3272| [45] [(So it's one of the other four...?)]
292: 3277| [45] [Once he thought that, every single one of them quickly seemed suspicious in his mind.]
293: 3282| [45] [His anxiety swelled up like a balloon, and his heart started racing faster and faster.]
294: 3287| [45] [Doubt begot more doubt-- but then it soon came full circle.]
295: 3292| [47] [Watase]
296: 3293| [45] [(No, wait... maybe it's the other way around?)]
297: 3298| [47] [Watase]
298: 3299| [45] [(What if -they're- the ones who hate -us-?)]
299: 3304| [45] [Those kids who could read people's minds were filled with malice and trying to back Watase's group into a corner for some reason.]
300: 3309| [45] [Maybe that was just an absurd theory, but--]
301: 3314| [47] [Watase]
302: 3315| [45] [(If it's true... then can we fight off guys like that...?)]
303: 3320| [45] [As soon as he thought that,]
304: 3418| [47] [Watase]
305: 3421| [45] ["!"]
306: 3426| [45] [a sudden headache ripped through Watase's skull, causing him to groan.]
307: 3434| [47] [Watase]
308: 3437| [45] ["Ghh... ugh...!"]
309: 3442| [45] [His consciousness started fading as he grew incredibly dizzy.]
310: 3452| [47] [Watase]
311: 3453| [45] [(Th... this is bad...!)]
312: 3510| [45] [Watase staggered his way out of the reference room as quickly as possible.]
313: 3516| [45] [Ena gasped as she noticed the sudden shift in Watase's condition.]
314: 3549| [47] [Ena]
315: 3552| [45] ["What's wrong!?"]
316: 3560| [47] [Watase]
317: 3563| [45] ["I-I... just started feeling sick...!"]
318: 3589| [47] [Ena]
319: 3592| [45] ["Huh!? Are you okay!?"]
320: 3600| [47] [Watase]
321: 3603| [45] ["S-sorry... but I've gotta go to the bathroom...!"]
322: 3611| [47] [Watase]
323: 3614| [45] ["Wait here for me...!"]
324: 3640| [47] [Ena]
325: 3643| [45] ["H-hold on a minute!"]
326: 3698| [45] [Watase rushed out of the reference room as he heard Ena call out to him.]
