  0:   61| [45] [--It was a memory of about two months ago.]
  1:   90| [45] [That day, Yuuri was in her own room in LABO, having a talk with the professor.]
  2:  116| [47] [Miyoko]
  3:  119| [45] ["--July 7th has come again this year, huh."]
  4:  127| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  130| [45] ["That was quick. Has it really been nine years already?"]
  6:  135| [45] [In all that time, Yuuri had grown, both physically and mentally.]
  7:  140| [45] [As a test subject, Yuuri had proven to be a major contribution to LABO's developed products-- especially in the fields of AD development and BC insulator improvement.]
  8:  145| [45] [She had not a single worry and spent her days in true peace.]
  9:  171| [47] [Miyoko]
 10:  174| [45] ["... Yuuri. How have these nine years been for you...?"]
 11:  182| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  185| [45] ["Huh? Well, they were fun."]
 13:  193| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  196| [45] ["You've bought me anything I've ever wanted and I get to live in such a nice room too..."]
 15:  264| [45] [--The only luxury she wasn't afforded was the freedom to go outside.]
 16:  269| [45] [But she had already stopped thinking about it.]
 17:  288| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  291| [45] ["... And besides, you're really nice, Professor. All the little things make me happy."]
 19:  299| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  302| [45] ["Um... You're like a real mom to me."]
 21:  329| [47] [Miyoko]
 22:  332| [45] ["... Yuuri."]
 23:  337| [45] [The professor wrapped her arms around Yuuri's shoulders.]
 24:  342| [45] [Just as Yuuri had said, the professor showered her with unrestrained love.]
 25:  347| [45] [The origin of that love was almost certainly due to the guilt she felt for Yuuri.]
 26:  352| [45] [But regardless, the two of them forged a relationship akin to a real mother and daughter.%NThey shared a deep understanding of each other.]
 27:  378| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  381| [45] ["... But now that today has come, we really do need to start thinking."]
 29:  389| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  392| [45] ["... About Hikorin, right?"]
 31:  397| [45] [Indeed-- now that today had come, there was something they were keenly reminded of, whether they wanted to think of it or not:]
 32:  402| [45] [Ever since that night when Yuuri had manipulated his memories, Natsuhiko had started seeing a phantom of her.]
 33:  469| [45] [--Nine years ago, Yuuri fabricated a false memory for Natsuhiko that she was "alive and always with him".]
 34:  519| [45] [And as part of that fabrication, she chose not to restore some of his memories, such as the particulars of the incident and how his BC abilities had awakened.]
 35:  524| [45] [It was a very selfish use of memory manipulation-- one that left a scar on his mind.]
 36:  592| [47] [Miyoko]
 37:  595| [45] ["... A human's personality consists of an accumulation of memories. The spirit is the aggregation of information within the brain..."]
 38:  603| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  606| [45] ["The addition of fabricated memories created a decisive inconsistency with reality."]
 40:  632| [47] [Miyoko]
 41:  635| [45] ["So in order to reconcile that inconsistency, Natsuhiko's brain created a phantom Yuuri to restore mental balance..."]
 42:  640| [45] [With just minor tampering to his memory, Natsuhiko became so firmly adherent to those lies that even his perception of reality became warped.]
 43:  645| [45] [Over these past nine years, Yuuri had become painfully aware of the sheer magnitude of the effects memory manipulation had on the human mind.]
 44:  653| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  656| [45] ["... Tell me, Professor. Was I right to do what I did?"]
 46:  682| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  685| [45] ["I can't say whether it was right or wrong, but it was true that you had no other choice."]
 48:  711| [47] [Miyoko]
 49:  714| [45] ["It was probably too hard for you to completely erase all of his memories of you with perfect accuracy to begin with."]
 50:  722| [47] [Yuuri]
 51:  725| [45] ["Huh?"]
 52:  751| [47] [Miyoko]
 53:  754| [45] ["We didn't really know it yet back then, but as our research progressed, we established that there are several issues with memory erasure, haven't we?"]
 54:  762| [47] [Miyoko]
 55:  765| [45] ["Such as how 'in almost all cases, erased memories are eventually restored'."]
 56:  773| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  776| [45] ["Good point..."]
 58:  781| [45] [Memories are lumps of powerful information energy.]
 59:  786| [45] [And memory erasure is an ability that destroys that lump of energy by striking it with even stronger energy.]
 60:  791| [45] [Which in turn causes the memory to disperse into fragments that are impossible to remember.]
 61:  796| [45] [However, the fragments of the memory and the memory in its entirety do not completely disappear.]
 62:  801| [45] [With the passage of enough time and given some sort of impetus, the brain can restructure the fragmentary information and restore the memory.]
 63:  806| [45] [The target's reaction is also significant.]
 64:  811| [45] [After all, sudden "amnesia" would astonish just about anybody to the point where they'd be driven to try and recall the vanished memory by whatever means necessary.]
 65:  837| [47] [Miyoko]
 66:  840| [45] ["... And besides, after you and Natsuhiko met, you were always together."]
 67:  848| [47] [Miyoko]
 68:  851| [45] ["Even if you forcibly erased all of his memories, there's no doubt that somebody would eventually bring you up as a matter of discussion."]
 69:  877| [47] [Miyoko]
 70:  880| [45] ["And once that happened, Natsuhiko would notice the contradiction between his memories and reality and would reach another deadlock with the truth."]
 71:  888| [47] [Miyoko]
 72:  891| [45] ["There was no other way to break that cycle than to do what you did..."]
 73:  896| [45] [Just as the professor said-- it was found to be far easier to cope with memory manipulation than with memory erasure.]
 74:  901| [45] [When a certain memory is replaced with a different memory, the brain obediently accepts the change.]
 75:  906| [45] [The reason for that is that rather than undergoing 'amnesia', the target may experience various other phenomena such as believing they simply remembered wrong.]
 76:  911| [45] [But Yuuri was well aware of what she had done.]
 77:  916| [47] [Yuuri]
 78:  917| [45] [(I'm sorry, Professor... but that's not all there was to it.)]
 79:  922| [45] [When she was a child, Yuuri just couldn't bear having Natsuhiko forget about her.]
 80:  927| [45] [But as a result, she had to keep cleaning up the mess she had made.]
 81:  932| [45] [As Yuuri reflected upon her actions, the professor suddenly looked at her watch.]
 82:  958| [47] [Miyoko]
 83:  961| [45] ["... Oh my. It's almost time for that boy to arrive."]
 84:  969| [47] [Yuuri]
 85:  972| [45] ["Ah, okay."]
 86:  998| [47] [Miyoko]
 87: 1001| [45] ["Let's go, Yuuri. It's time for your yearly date."]
 88: 1015| [45] [Yuuri nodded and left the room with the professor.]
 89: 1064| [45] [--They headed for the Area 5 neuroscience laboratory.]
 90: 1074| [45] [There, Yuuri reunited with Natsuhiko.]
 91: 1135| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1138| [45] ["It's been a whole year, hasn't it, Hikorin?"]
 93: 1143| [45] [In front of them was Natsuhiko, put to sleep with drugs.]
 94: 1148| [45] [LABO staff had brought him all the way here.]
 95: 1156| [47] [Miyoko]
 96: 1159| [45] ["Yuuri, you'd rather be alone with him, wouldn't you? I'll be waiting outside."]
 97: 1167| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1170| [45] ["Ah... y-yes. Thank you."]
 99: 1181| [45] [The professor smiled boldly as she left the room.]
100: 1229| [45] [--Back on the night where Yuuri agreed to her incarceration in LABO--]
101: 1234| [45] [She had asked the professor for one favor.]
102: 1302| [47] [Yuuri]
103: 1305| [45] ["Please let me see him... Even just once in a while... Even just once a year. Please."]
104: 1313| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1316| [45] ["That's all I ask."]
106: 1342| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 1345| [45] ["... I promise."]
108: 1394| [45] [--The professor kept that promise.]
109: 1399| [45] [Once each year on July 7, the anniversary of the accident, Yuuri was allowed to see him in this fashion.]
110: 1404| [45] [Granted, Natsuhiko himself was not aware of these little dates.]
111: 1409| [45] [He was under the impression that he stayed at Rokumei City Hospital once a year for a yearly checkup.]
112: 1414| [45] [And once he was there, he'd be administered with a sleeping medication and taken to LABO-- and back again-- before he woke up.]
113: 1514| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1515| [45] [(This is the only way we can meet... but it's plenty.)]
115: 1520| [45] [However, the purpose of these reunions wasn't only so she could see his face.]
116: 1525| [45] [He was brought here once a year to renew the "memory of the Yuuri" that was inside him.]
117: 1530| [45] [The phantom Yuuri created by his brain was, after all, a phantom and nothing more.]
118: 1535| [45] [If no action were taken, the phantom Yuuri would gradually become disparate from the real Yuuri.]
119: 1540| [45] [This was, in essence, maintenance to adjust for changes and disparities-- Such was the truth of Natsuhiko's "yearly checkups".]
120: 1545| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1546| [45] [(... I'm not quite sure if this is really for Hikorin's sake...)]
122: 1551| [47] [Yuuri]
123: 1552| [45] [(But to be honest, I'm glad I get to see him.)]
124: 1557| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1558| [45] [(Forgive me, Hikorin...)]
126: 1565| [45] [Yuuri gently bowed her head and stepped up to Natsuhiko.]
127: 1573| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1576| [45] ["How was your year...?"]
129: 1640| [45] [And thus, Yuuri dove into Natsuhiko's memory.]
130: 1797| [45] [--A year's worth of memories floated in Natsuhiko's mind.]
131: 1802| [45] [They were sights of an uneventful daily life.]
132: 1865| [47] [Mashiro]
133: 1868| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Food's ready~!"]
134: 1876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 1879| [45] ["Ah, sorry for always making you do this."]
136: 1905| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 1908| [45] ["It's fine, it's fine. I'm doing it because I want to see your smiling face~!"]
138: 1913| [45] [It was a scene of a morning before school.]
139: 1921| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1922| [45] [(Ah, it's Mashiron!)]
141: 1927| [45] [Yuuri loved Mashiro too.]
142: 1932| [45] [Though it was only in a memory, Yuuri was honestly glad to see Mashiro again.]
143: 1943| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1946| [45] ["There you go joking again. It's not for me, but for Yuuri, right?"]
145: 1972| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 1975| [45] ["Ah, saw through my ruse?"]
147: 1980| [45] [Apparently Mashiro began cooking meals at Natsuhiko's house this spring.]
148: 1985| [45] [So these newest memories included a lot of memories with Mashiro.]
149: 2141| [47] [Mashiro]
150: 2144| [45] ["C'mon, c'mon, Natsuhiko. We're gonna be late."]
151: 2152| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2155| [45] ["S-sorry. I ate too much during breakfast..."]
153: 2160| [45] [Each individual memory was trivial by itself.]
154: 2302| [47] [Mashiro]
155: 2305| [45] ["Natsuhiko, come shopping with me. There's just a few things I want to buy."]
156: 2313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 2316| [45] ["What. More anime shop visits?"]
158: 2342| [47] [Mashiro]
159: 2345| [45] ["Why not? Not like you're busy, right?"]
160: 2350| [45] [But something bothered Yuuri about Mashiro's facial expressions in these memories.]
161: 2538| [47] [Mashiro]
162: 2541| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Natsuhiko look at this! Cute, right?"]
163: 2549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2552| [45] ["So what you wanted to buy was clothes? Look, I don't really get girl clothes."]
165: 2578| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 2581| [45] ["I just want a boy's opinion. Wanna get a less biased view, that's all."]
167: 2586| [45] [The way Mashiro looked at, spoke to, and behaved with Natsuhiko--]
168: 2591| [45] [--made it quite obvious that she was falling in love with him.]
169: 2794| [45] [In Natsuhiko's memory, Mashiro had talked to the phantom.]
170: 2827| [47] [Mashiro]
171: 2830| [45] ["Hey, Yuuri, what do you think about the food today?"]
172: 2863| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 2866| [45] [{It's delicious~ Mashiron, you sure are getting good at cooking.}]
174: 2874| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 2877| [45] [{You're so cute and you're good at cooking... You're like an ideal wife.}]
176: 2903| [47] [Mashiro]
177: 2906| [45] ["Now that's a precious thing to say. So how about it, Yuuri? Will you marry me?"]
178: 2911| [45] [--She was able to hold a conversation without any issue.]
179: 2916| [45] [It was as if Yuuri actually existed there.]
180: 2946| [45] [Yuuri was painfully aware of just how amazing a feat that was.]
181: 2951| [45] [Just being able to hold a conversation like that would've required Mashiro to train her ability to the point that she could use empathy like it was nothing.]
182: 2956| [45] [And there was only one reason she'd go through such lengths.]
183: 2961| [47] [Yuuri]
184: 2962| [45] [(Mashiron likes...)]
185: 2967| [47] [Yuuri]
186: 2968| [45] [(Mashiron wants to be with Hikorin so much that she...!)]
187: 3001| [47] [Yuuri]
188: 3002| [45] [(Mashiron...)]
189: 3007| [47] [Yuuri]
190: 3008| [45] [(She likes Hikorin...?)]
191: 3161| [45] [--As Yuuri returned to reality, she gazed at Natsuhiko's sleeping face and whispered.]
192: 3211| [47] [Yuuri]
193: 3214| [45] ["... That's right."]
194: 3222| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 3225| [45] ["I can't keep Hikorin to myself forever..."]
196: 3230| [45] [It would be way too cruel to do that to Mashiro.]
197: 3284| [47] [Yuuri]
198: 3285| [45] [(Mashiron's a way better girl than I am, after all...)]
199: 3290| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 3291| [45] [(Hikorin's better off with her...)]
201: 3306| [45] [At any rate, Yuuri would never be able to properly see Natsuhiko in person for the rest of her life.]
202: 3311| [45] [It was already unnatural for her to be seeing him this way as it was.]
203: 3316| [45] [In that case, both Natsuhiko and Mashiro would be better off if they forgot about Yuuri.]
204: 3321| [45] [That thought began to rapidly spread within Yuuri's mind.]
205: 3376| [45] [She walked out of the laboratory with slumped shoulders to find the professor waiting in the hall.]
206: 3409| [47] [Miyoko]
207: 3412| [45] ["Yuuri, how was your yearly date?"]
208: 3420| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 3423| [45] ["Professor..."]
210: 3477| [47] [Yuuri]
211: 3480| [45] ["Do you think it would be better... if I replaced all of Hikorin's memories of me... with memories of Mashiron...?"]
212: 3506| [47] [Miyoko]
213: 3509| [45] ["... Huh? What makes you say that again?"]
214: 3517| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 3520| [45] ["It's just, if I don't, then Mashiron will never..."]
216: 3546| [47] [Miyoko]
217: 3549| [45] ["... Are you worrying yourself over Mashiro?"]
218: 3554| [45] [Yuuri nodded weakly.]
219: 3641| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 3644| [45] ["The three of us were always together... so I don't think he'd notice too much of a contradiction."]
221: 3652| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 3655| [45] ["And besides... I've wanted those two to get along better ever since we were kids..."]
223: 3663| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 3666| [45] ["Hikorin and Mashiron always fought back then, but they don't do that anymore, so..."]
225: 3674| [47] [Yuuri]
226: 3677| [45] ["So I think... it's about time the two of them started getting along better."]
227: 3700| [47] [Miyoko]
228: 3701| [45] ["..."]
229: 3706| [45] [The professor fell silent, her face clearly showing she was at a loss for words.]
230: 3711| [45] [But eventually, she sighed and spoke.]
231: 3719| [47] [Miyoko]
232: 3722| [45] ["I understand how you feel... but it would probably be bad to do that too."]
233: 3730| [45] [But after a moment of contemplation, the professor shook her head and replied.]
234: 3756| [47] [Miyoko]
235: 3759| [45] ["It would probably be bad to do that..."]
236: 3767| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 3770| [45] ["Why's that?"]
238: 3796| [47] [Miyoko]
239: 3799| [45] ["I believe that manipulating Natsuhiko's memories about you would cause serious problems in his mind."]
240: 3807| [47] [Yuuri]
241: 3810| [45] ["Oh no... But if I do it carefully, then..."]
242: 3836| [47] [Miyoko]
243: 3839| [45] ["No. Your existence is too important to Natsuhiko to just erase it."]
244: 3865| [47] [Miyoko]
245: 3868| [45] ["And even if that weren't the case, Natsuhiko's mind is already affected by innumerable problems."]
246: 3876| [47] [Yuuri]
247: 3879| [45] ["Huh?"]
248: 3887| [47] [Miyoko]
249: 3890| [45] ["So far, Natsuhiko has nearly noticed your absence several times, but he has yet to recognize it."]
250: 3898| [47] [Miyoko]
251: 3901| [45] ["That cognitive dissonance has resulted in bizarre behavior from him as well."]
252: 3909| [47] [Yuuri]
253: 3912| [45] ["Bizarre behavior...?"]
254: 3938| [47] [Miyoko]
255: 3941| [45] ["For example, Natsuhiko has prepared hot milk for you in our living room before, correct?"]
256: 3949| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 3952| [45] ["R-right."]
258: 3960| [47] [Miyoko]
259: 3963| [45] ["But since you don't actually exist there, the milk in your cup never decreases in volume, see."]
260: 3989| [47] [Miyoko]
261: 3992| [45] ["But Natsuhiko never questioned that fact."]
262: 4000| [47] [Miyoko]
263: 4003| [45] ["He empties the completely full cup of cold milk in the sink without a word."]
264: 4029| [47] [Miyoko]
265: 4032| [45] ["If you try and tell him that the cup's full, he just says 'Huh, what?' and makes a genuinely confused face."]
266: 4040| [47] [Yuuri]
267: 4043| [45] ["Is... is that a thing?"]
268: 4052| [47] [Miyoko]
269: 4055| [45] ["It is. It's called 'denial syndrome', incidentally..."]
270: 4081| [47] [Miyoko]
271: 4084| [45] ["He's had several other instances of bizarre behavior."]
272: 4092| [47] [Miyoko]
273: 4095| [45] ["For example, every day before he leaves for school, he turns the living room lights on."]
274: 4103| [47] [Yuuri]
275: 4106| [45] ["The lights? Why?"]
276: 4132| [47] [Miyoko]
277: 4135| [45] ["Because if he didn't, there would be no lights on at home by the time he got back."]
278: 4143| [47] [Miyoko]
279: 4146| [45] ["It wouldn't make sense if there were no lights on in the house even though you were supposed to be there."]
280: 4154| [47] [Miyoko]
281: 4157| [45] ["So to avoid that inconsistency, Natsuhiko turns the lights on before he leaves the house...%NAnd he does it all unconsciously."]
282: 4162| [45] [Once she had heard all that, Yuuri murmured in a quivering voice.]
283: 4170| [47] [Yuuri]
284: 4173| [45] ["Then all because of me, Hikorin's...!"]
285: 4199| [47] [Miyoko]
286: 4202| [45] ["No, it's not your fault."]
287: 4210| [47] [Miyoko]
288: 4213| [45] ["Denial syndrome often occurs when the brain encounters any sort of functional abnormality."]
289: 4239| [47] [Miyoko]
290: 4242| [45] ["Such cases have been reported worldwide... All of the bizarre behaviors Natsuhiko has demonstrated have been seen in other patients."]
291: 4268| [47] [Miyoko]
292: 4271| [45] ["So please... don't you ever say it's your fault again."]
293: 4276| [45] [That didn't stop the tears from flowing.]
294: 4281| [45] [The gravity of her actions nine years ago threatened to crush Yuuri.]
295: 4289| [47] [Yuuri]
296: 4292| [45] ["Professor... what do I do...?"]
297: 4318| [47] [Miyoko]
298: 4321| [45] ["Let's see... If Natsuhiko were to become strong enough to handle the truth one day..."]
299: 4329| [47] [Miyoko]
300: 4332| [45] ["Maybe it would be okay to tell it to him then."]
301: 4340| [47] [Yuuri]
302: 4343| [45] ["But how will we know when that time has come...?"]
303: 4369| [47] [Miyoko]
304: 4372| [45] ["We won't. So one day--"]
305: 4398| [47] [Miyoko]
306: 4401| [45] ["One day, I'll free you from LABO. I swear."]
307: 4424| [47] [Yuuri]
308: 4427| [45] ["!?"]
309: 4432| [45] [Yuuri doubted her ears.]
310: 4437| [45] [She couldn't believe the leading researcher in the field of BC would say such a thing.]
311: 4445| [47] [Miyoko]
312: 4448| [45] ["LABO will no longer have a reason to restrain you once we've solved all the mysteries surrounding BC."]
313: 4456| [47] [Miyoko]
314: 4459| [45] ["I intend to devote my life to make sure that happens."]
315: 4485| [47] [Miyoko]
316: 4488| [45] ["I doubt it will redeem me for my sin of destroying your life, though..."]
317: 4496| [47] [Yuuri]
318: 4499| [45] ["But you didn't..."]
319: 4507| [47] [Miyoko]
320: 4510| [45] ["And even if I can't fulfill that promise..."]
321: 4536| [47] [Miyoko]
322: 4539| [45] ["I will gladly do whatever I can to get you all out of here. Even if it costs me my life."]
323: 4547| [47] [Yuuri]
324: 4550| [45] ["Huh?"]
325: 4576| [47] [Miyoko]
326: 4579| [45] ["Truth be told, I've been secretly advancing preparations for such a plan."]
327: 4605| [47] [Miyoko]
328: 4608| [45] ["It's not something I can do alone, so it'll be a difficult journey... but one day, for sure..."]
329: 4641| [45] [The professor spoke remorsefully as she brought Yuuri into a gentle embrace.]
330: 4646| [45] [--Yuuri understood.]
331: 4651| [45] [That it was another wish that could not be granted.]
332: 4656| [45] [For the two of them had been together for nine years. Yuuri could tell the professor felt hopeless, even without using BC.]
333: 4661| [47] [Yuuri]
334: 4662| [45] [(BC research is endless...)]
335: 4667| [47] [Yuuri]
336: 4668| [45] [(And I'm sure there are other reasons why they keep me incarcerated.)]
337: 4673| [47] [Yuuri]
338: 4674| [45] [(Not that I can imagine what those reasons are...)]
339: 4679| [45] [But regardless, she questioned whether or not she had to stay there forever.]
340: 4684| [45] [She questioned how to free Natsuhiko and Mashiro from the curse she cast over them.]
341: 4689| [45] [But without her finding a single answer to any of these questions--]
342: 4694| [45] [The days passed by.]
343: 4901| [45] [--Yuuri went back through her memories countless times, and in the process, she reaffirmed her feelings in detail.]
344: 4906| [45] [Her feelings for Natsuhiko and the others.]
345: 4911| [45] [And-- her feelings for "her".]
346: 4916| [45] [The girl who was truly isolated, unable to interact with anybody.]
347: 4921| [45] [As Yuuri thinks about that girl's existence, a new memory rises up from the innermost depths of her mind...]
