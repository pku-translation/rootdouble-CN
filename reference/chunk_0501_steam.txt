  0:   53| [45] [--Complaints aside, once Jun and the others rescued "Ena", the Rokumei Academy teacher--]
  1:  121| [45] [They headed to the surveillance room in Area 3, where they encountered "Ukita", a researcher.]
  2:  172| [45] [They then learned that "Natsuhiko", "Mashiro", and "Louise", the three high schoolers Jun had become acquainted with over the past week, were trapped in the facility...]
  3:  177| [45] [As a result, they focused their efforts on rescuing them.]
  4:  182| [45] [With limited AD, rising radiation levels, and no escape route in sight, the situation was extremely harsh.]
  5:  230| [45] [Teamwork was more essential than anything else at this point--]
  6:  235| [45] [Yet someone disrupted that teamwork.]
  7:  325| [47] [Ena]
  8:  328| [45] ["Oh come on, it's just smoke! I didn't take rescue workers for cowards!"]
  9:  333| [45] [And that someone was none other than Ena.]
 10:  338| [45] [Jun had called the search to a halt when she'd spotted smoke filling the outer ring, only to get another earful from Ena.]
 11:  343| [45] [Jun could tell she was trying to rush the search along because she was really worried about her students.]
 12:  348| [47] [Jun]
 13:  349| [45] [(But as a rescue worker, I just can't accept that!)]
 14:  354| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Yuuri came running over just as Jun thought that.]
 15:  387| [47] [Watase]
 16:  390| [45] ["Wh-what happened!?"]
 17:  423| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  426| [45] ["Moribe, what's all this commotion about!?"]
 19:  434| [47] [Jun]
 20:  437| [45] ["Ah, Lieutenant!"]
 21:  445| [47] [Jun]
 22:  448| [45] ["There's smoke in the outer ring up ahead. Looks like there's traces of a fire there."]
 23:  456| [47] [Jun]
 24:  459| [45] ["But we don't know where the fire's coming from since there's a ton of rooms, so I was telling Ms. Tsubakiyama and Mr. Ukita to wait somewhere safe, but--"]
 25:  485| [47] [Ena]
 26:  488| [45] ["Don't be an idiot! If there's traces of a fire, then that's all the more reason why we should -all- be searching!"]
 27:  493| [45] [Ena started yelling again.]
 28:  501| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  504| [45] ["Do you want to die?"]
 30:  565| [47] [Ena]
 31:  568| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 32:  594| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  597| [45] ["If you don't want to die, then please stop complaining and listen to us."]
 34:  602| [45] [But she was rendered silent by Kazami's blunt words.]
 35:  628| [47] [Ena]
 36:  631| [45] ["... I-I just wanted to help..."]
 37:  657| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  660| [45] ["And I truly am grateful for that. I apologize for being harsh on you."]
 39:  668| [47] [Kazami]
 40:  671| [45] ["But you can't take even the smallest of fires lightly. Please trust our judgment when it comes to disaster sites."]
 41:  679| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  682| [45] ["Our mission is to ensure that everyone gets out of here in one piece. So please--"]
 43:  687| [45] [Not even Ena could resist caving in to Kazami's kind yet firm appeal.]
 44:  713| [47] [Ena]
 45:  716| [45] ["All right... then I'll leave it up to the professionals."]
 46:  721| [45] [Jun was impressed.]
 47:  728| [47] [Jun]
 48:  729| [45] [(That's Sis for you... She managed to persuade Ms. Tsubakiyama so calmly in less than a minute. I should follow her example.)]
 49:  734| [45] [She resolved to deal with these situations more like Kazami in the future.]
