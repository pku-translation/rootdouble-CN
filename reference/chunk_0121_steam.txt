  1:  120| [47] [Watase]
  2:  123| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
  3:  128| [45] [A boy garbed in a school uniform was lying there.]
  4:  133| [45] [His body was collapsed in a vast pool of blood.]
  5:  138| [47] [Watase]
  6:  139| [45] [(Isn't that... Natsuhiko Tenkawa!?)]
  7:  144| [45] [His name and face matched up perfectly with Watase's memory of him.]
  8:  152| [47] [Watase]
  9:  155| [45] ["Hey! Are you okay!?"]
 10:  160| [45] [But Natsuhiko didn't respond to his calls.]
 11:  165| [45] [Watase took off his gloves and pressed his index finger against Natsuhiko's carotid artery.]
 12:  170| [47] [Watase]
 13:  171| [45] [(...!!)]
 14:  176| [45] [He couldn't feel a pulse, and Natsuhiko's body was growing colder and colder.]
 15:  184| [47] [Watase]
 16:  187| [45] ["I-is he dead...!?"]
 17:  192| [45] [Watase took off his Vital Checker and strapped it on Natsuhiko's arm to find out.]
 18:  289| [45] [--All red. Vital signs flat.]
 19:  294| [45] [Watase looked over Natsuhiko's body to find there were several small holes and wounds here and there behind his uniform.]
 20:  318| [47] [Watase]
 21:  321| [45] ["... Gunshot wounds!?"]
 22:  326| [45] [The sight of them was no longer as shocking to Watase after having seen so many of them before.]
 23:  331| [45] [The blood oozing from those wounds hadn't dried yet.]
 24:  336| [47] [Watase]
 25:  337| [45] [(Does that mean he only just died right before I got here!?)]
 26:  345| [47] [Watase]
 27:  348| [45] ["Dammit, don't die on me! I won't let you die, goddammit!"]
 28:  396| [45] [Watase laid Natsuhiko flat on the floor and began CPR.]
 29:  401| [47] [Watase]
 30:  402| [45] [(Just do it like Tachibana and Moribe did--!)]
 31:  407| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 32:  415| [47] [Watase]
 33:  418| [45] ["Please! Stay with me! I'm begging you!"]
 34:  423| [45] [Watase withstood his headaches and convulsions in his desperate attempt at CPR.]
 35:  428| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 36:  433| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 37:  438| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions.%N2 rescue breaths.]
 38:  443| [45] [However--]
 39:  451| [47] [Watase]
 40:  454| [45] ["..."]
 41:  459| [45] [No matter how many times he tried, the boy's heart remained still.]
 42:  464| [45] [He was dead. He'd passed away all alone in this vast, empty hall--]
 43:  472| [47] [Watase]
 44:  475| [45] ["... Dammit..."]
 45:  480| [45] [Watase hung his head feebly as he stayed where he was.]
 46:  485| [45] [The boy had undoubtedly been alive just a few minutes ago.]
 47:  490| [45] [He'd probably been struggling to hold on to life as he awaited rescue.]
 48:  495| [45] [But-- Watase hadn't made it in time.]
 49:  500| [45] [He'd failed to save a life he'd been charged with saving.]
 50:  508| [47] [Watase]
 51:  511| [45] ["U-uwaa..."]
 52:  519| [47] [Watase]
 53:  522| [45] ["... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
 54:  530| [47] [Watase]
 55:  533| [45] ["Why!? Why, goddammit!?"]
 56:  541| [47] [Watase]
 57:  544| [45] ["I finally found you after coming all this way! You can't die on me!!"]
 58:  555| [45] [Watase's shouts echoed through the hall.]
 59:  563| [47] [Watase]
 60:  566| [45] ["Dammit... I...!"]
 61:  574| [47] [Watase]
 62:  577| [45] ["I failed again...!"]
 63:  582| [45] [Just then, Watase spotted something out of the corner of his eye.]
 64:  587| [47] [Watase]
 65:  588| [45] [(...!?)]
 66:  593| [45] [Something with a black luster was lying next to Natsuhiko.]
 67:  690| [45] [There was no doubt about it: it was a pistol.]
 68:  695| [45] [It was probably the weapon that had robbed the boy of his life.]
 69:  700| [45] [Much like how Ena had been shot through the head with one of these.]
 70:  705| [45] [He didn't know who'd killed them.]
 71:  710| [45] [But Watase felt like that pistol was the cause of all of it.]
 72:  718| [47] [Watase]
 73:  721| [45] ["Damn this piece of shit... If it weren't for this damn thing!"]
 74:  726| [45] [Watase picked it up and was about to throw it to the ground-- but then...]
