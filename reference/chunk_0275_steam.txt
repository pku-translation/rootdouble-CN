  1:   63| [45] [--And at the same time, Natsuhiko made a new decision of his own.]
  2:   68| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   69| [45] [(I'm happy to see Yuuri again... but there are some things I need clarified first.)]
  4:  156| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  157| [45] [(If Mr. Ukita's an enemy, then what about Prof. Tsubakiyama!?)]
  6:  206| [45] [There were several unnatural aspects to Ena's actions, especially how she wasn't%N"opening her heart" to them--]
  7:  223| [45] [Natsuhiko resolved himself and sent her telepathy.]
  8:  284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  287| [45] [{--Professor, can you hear me? It's me, Natsuhiko Tenkawa.}]
 10:  295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  298| [45] [{I'm still here in LABO. Where are you, Professor?}]
 12:  303| [45] [He followed up with empathy-- and immediately heard Ena's mental voice.]
 13:  362| [47] [Ena]
 14:  365| [45] [{M-Mr. Tenkawa!? Was that Mr. Tenkawa's telepathy just now!?}]
 15:  370| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  371| [45] [(I got through to Prof. Tsubakiyama!)]
 17:  376| [45] [Natsuhiko rejoiced in his mind as he made use of telepathy and empathy to try and hold a conversation with Ena.]
 18:  384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  387| [45] [{That's right! And I'm reading your mental voice with empathy!}]
 20:  411| [47] [Ena]
 21:  414| [45] [{H-hold on a second...! Nobody told me you could use empathy!}]
 22:  438| [47] [Ena]
 23:  441| [45] [{Don't tell me you falsified your ability level!?}]
 24:  449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  452| [45] [{!!? N-no, that's not it at all!}]
 26:  460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  463| [45] [{My ability's just been rapidly advancing these past few days...}]
 28:  527| [47] [Ena]
 29:  530| [45] [{...!}]
 30:  535| [45] [At that very moment, Natsuhiko clearly felt wariness from Ena.]
 31:  543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  546| [45] [{Professor, are you putting up your guard!?}]
 33:  551| [45] [When he tried using empathy,]
 34:  580| [47] [Ena]
 35:  583| [45] [{... --'m not p--...!}]
 36:  588| [45] [Ena's mental voice was coated with noise.]
 37:  596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  599| [45] [{P-Professor! Are you closing your heart again!?}]
 39:  609| [47] [Ena]
 40:  612| [45] [{--...---rry... --..--...--}]
 41:  617| [47] [Ena]
 42:  620| [45] [{--GF--... ene... --'s--...--...}]
 43:  625| [47] [Ena]
 44:  628| [45] [{...--...--...}]
 45:  646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  649| [45] [{Please wait! Professor! Professor!}]
 47:  654| [45] [--Natsuhiko tried to speak to her, but he could no longer hear Ena's mental voice.]
 48:  669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  670| [45] [(Dammit... Prof. Tsubakiyama really does have a wall around her heart...!)]
 50:  675| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  676| [45] [(Is there nobody we can trust...!?)]
 52:  681| [45] [Considering how her heart was closed, perhaps it would be too dangerous to blindly trust her.]
 53:  686| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  687| [45] [(... Guess I've got no choice. Let's not count on Prof. Tsubakiyama for now.)]
 55:  692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  693| [45] [(Who else could we trust...?)]
 57:  698| [45] [Ena was suspect, and Kazami, Jun, and Ukita were completely out of the question.]
 58:  785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  786| [45] [(It's gotta be Salyu, then.)]
 60:  850| [45] [Natsuhiko focused his mind and sent telepathy to Salyu.]
 61:  911| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  914| [45] [{Salyu, can you hear me!? Answer me if you can!}]
 63:  919| [45] [But when he tried to use empathy--]
 64:  924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  925| [45] [(... Huh?)]
 66:  930| [45] [There was no response from Salyu.]
 67:  968| [45] [She was either out of Natsuhiko's empathy range, or--]
 68:  973| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  974| [45] [(Don't tell me... she's been knocked out this whole time after falling from the staircase!?)]
 70:  979| [45] [He didn't think Kazami would attack her, but he felt Salyu would be in danger if she were still unconscious.]
 71:  984| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  985| [45] [(I gotta get to Salyu quick--)]
 73:  992| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind--]
 74: 1042| [45] [--he suddenly heard a voice echo in his head.]
 75: 1099| [85] [{... Na...}]
 76: 1100| [86] [???]
 77: 1101| [86] [{... Na...}]
 78: 1116| [85] [{... Natsu... hiko...}]
 79: 1117| [86] [???]
 80: 1118| [86] [{... Natsu... hiko...}]
 81: 1164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1167| [45] ["!?"]
 83: 1172| [45] [It sounded like telepathy coming from Mashiro.]
 84: 1177| [45] [But she was supposed to have escaped!]
 85: 1191| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1194| [45] [{M-Mashiro! Why am I getting telepathy from you!?}]
 87: 1202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1205| [45] [{Didn't you escape!?}]
 89: 1234| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1237| [45] [{H... huh...? A response...?}]
 91: 1242| [47] [Mashiro]
 92: 1245| [45] [{... Or am I hearing things...?}]
 93: 1253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1256| [45] [{You're not just hearing things! It's me! I'm using telepathy!}]
 95: 1264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1267| [45] [{Hang in there, Mashiro! What happened!?}]
 97: 1291| [47] [Mashiro]
 98: 1294| [45] [{Ah... I'm sorry, my head's all hazy...}]
 99: 1299| [47] [Mashiro]
100: 1302| [45] [{Uh... you see... I...}]
101: 1307| [47] [Mashiro]
102: 1310| [45] [{I still... haven't actually... escaped from LABO...}]
103: 1318| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1321| [45] [{Wh... why not!? Weren't you able to escape through the cargo lift!?}]
105: 1345| [47] [Mashiro]
106: 1348| [45] [{Well... the lift did get to the surface level...}]
107: 1353| [47] [Mashiro]
108: 1356| [45] [{But there was a wall or something... blocking the way right outside the lift... so I couldn't get out.}]
109: 1379| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1382| [45] [{...!}]
111: 1387| [45] [Natsuhiko's eyes widened at those words.]
112: 1441| [45] [Apparently there was a bulkhead blocking the lift in the same way there were ones blocking the hallways past the emergency staircases!]
113: 1446| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1447| [45] [(Was there never an escape route to begin with!?)]
115: 1452| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1453| [45] [(But that's the same place we escaped through nine years ago--!)]
117: 1458| [45] [Security apparently grew stricter since that incident.]
118: 1510| [45] [But the most worrying thing was that the cargo lift couldn't go down to the basement from the surface on its own.]
119: 1515| [45] [So that meant she'd been in the lift the whole time, unable to escape outside or return to the basement...!]
120: 1557| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1560| [45] [{O-okay, Mashiro! I'll come save you right now!}]
122: 1584| [47] [Mashiro]
123: 1587| [45] [{Yeah... thank... you...}]
124: 1602| [45] [Mashiro's telepathy cut out there.]
125: 1607| [45] [--Natsuhiko deeply regretted his shallow planning.]
126: 1612| [45] [Even though he thought he had no other options, what he did still failed to get Mashiro out of there in the end.]
127: 1617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1618| [45] [(Even worse. It locked her up all alone for hours...!)]
129: 1623| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1624| [45] [(I need to save her as soon as possible!)]
131: 1685| [45] [The part that Natsuhiko had ripped out of the cargo lift control panel was still inside his pocket.]
132: 1690| [45] [That part could perhaps be used to repair the lift, but could Natsuhiko even get there with his body in that condition?]
133: 1729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1730| [45] [(--No, I still need to go! I'll leave Salyu up to Watase and go save Mashiro myself!)]
135: 1756| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1759| [45] ["Yuuri, I'm sorry, but wait for me here. I'm going to go save Mashiro."]
137: 1785| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 1788| [45] ["Huh?"]
139: 1796| [47] [Watase]
140: 1799| [45] ["What?"]
141: 1823| [45] [Not just Yuuri, but Watase spoke up too.]
142: 1877| [47] [Watase]
143: 1880| [45] ["Look, Natsuhiko, I'm telling you you can't be moving about on your own. You could open your wounds and die, you know?"]
144: 1888| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 1891| [45] ["No, but..."]
146: 1917| [47] [Watase]
147: 1920| [45] ["No buts. I know you're worried about your friends, but calm down and think straight for a second."]
148: 1928| [47] [Watase]
149: 1931| [45] ["If you want to search for that Mashiro girl, then I'll go in your stead."]
150: 1936| [45] [Watase spoke firmly. But what he said made sense.]
151: 1941| [45] [If Natsuhiko went to save Mashiro with his body in its current state, it could easily be double trouble.]
152: 1946| [45] [So in the end, he had no choice but to rely on Watase.]
153: 1951| [45] [Natsuhiko reluctantly asked him.]
154: 1959| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 1962| [45] ["... Okay then, Captain Kasasagi. Please rescue Mashiro."]
156: 1988| [47] [Watase]
157: 1991| [45] ["Of course. But I still don't know where she is. We've searched every corner of the facility and haven't found her."]
158: 1999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2002| [45] ["Then have you checked inside the cargo lift?"]
160: 2028| [47] [Watase]
161: 2031| [45] ["Inside the cargo lift?"]
162: 2036| [45] [Natsuhiko tried his best to act casual in response to the dubious look Watase shot him with.]
163: 2044| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2047| [45] ["Mashiro and I got separated in the factory."]
165: 2055| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2058| [45] ["If she hasn't escaped, then it's highly possible she's inside the cargo lift."]
167: 2084| [47] [Watase]
168: 2087| [45] ["But the Commander said that 'three high school students have yet to escape'."]
169: 2113| [47] [Watase]
170: 2116| [45] ["If she escaped to the surface from the cargo lift, wouldn't the Commander have her under their protection?"]
171: 2124| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2127| [45] ["No, if you think about how the bulkheads lowered above the emergency staircases-- the same could be true for the cargo lift."]
173: 2153| [47] [Watase]
174: 2156| [45] ["Ah, I see...! Now that you mention it, you've got a point."]
175: 2161| [45] [Watase's eyes widened as that realization hit him. Natsuhiko nodded and continued.]
176: 2169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2172| [45] ["So even if Mashiro managed to get to the surface floors with the lift, a bulkhead could still stop her in her tracks..."]
178: 2180| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2183| [45] ["So it's possible that she's been left behind there this entire time."]
180: 2209| [47] [Watase]
181: 2212| [45] ["That would explain why we haven't been able to find her so far... I can't think of any other places to look either, so I think it's worth a shot!"]
182: 2217| [45] [And then, as if he had felt a sense of hope, Watase spoke out in a cheerful voice.]
183: 2243| [47] [Watase]
184: 2246| [45] ["All right! Then I'll try to repair the cargo lift and bring it back down here!"]
185: 2254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
186: 2257| [45] ["Please do. --Oh, right, this might come in handy..."]
187: 2262| [45] [Natsuhiko used that opportunity to bring the control panel part out of his pocket.]
188: 2267| [45] [With its torn cables and its up and down buttons.]
189: 2275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2278| [45] ["I found this on the floor by the lift. It's probably a part of the control panel."]
191: 2304| [47] [Watase]
192: 2307| [45] ["A part?"]
193: 2315| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2318| [45] ["I tried repairing the control panel with this, but I didn't have the skills to pull it off... so I put it in my pocket and forgot about it."]
195: 2326| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2329| [45] ["But I thought you might be able to fix it..."]
197: 2355| [47] [Watase]
198: 2358| [45] ["Got it. I'll use this to try and repair the lift."]
199: 2384| [47] [Watase]
200: 2387| [45] ["But then again, if I go, that'll leave the two of you completely defenseless..."]
201: 2395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2398| [45] ["True..."]
203: 2405| [45] [Natsuhiko looked around the room as he spoke.]
204: 2453| [45] [He soon noticed there was another keypad on the shelter side of the iron door.]
205: 2458| [45] [Typing the password into that keypad would probably open up the wall outside.]
206: 2521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 2524| [45] ["Okay then, Captain Kasasagi. Can you destroy the password keypad when you get outside?"]
208: 2532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2535| [45] ["If you do that, then nobody can get into this room unless we open it from the inside."]
210: 2561| [47] [Watase]
211: 2564| [45] ["I see, that sounds like a plan. Okay, then I'll give you a signal when I'm back, so open it up for me on the inside, okay?"]
212: 2572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 2575| [45] ["Understood."]
214: 2581| [45] [Watase consented to Natsuhiko's plan and promptly exited the shelter.]
215: 2606| [45] [As Watase walked away, Yuuri called out to him.]
216: 2614| [47] [Yuuri]
217: 2617| [45] ["U-um, Captain Kasasagi... thanks for everything."]
218: 2646| [47] [Watase]
219: 2649| [45] ["Hey, c'mon, it's not over yet. I'll be back, so sit tight, you two."]
220: 2655| [45] [And with those parting words, Watase left the shelter.]
