  1:   75| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   78| [45] ["!!"]
  3:   83| [45] [He looked back to see the man standing by the entrance of the small room.]
  4:   88| [45] [The man glared at Natsuhiko with his gun at his waist.]
  5:   93| [45] [Natsuhiko immediately focused and sent a full-force wave of telepathy with all of his willpower.]
  6:  158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  161| [45] [{STOP!!!!!!}]
  8:  166| [45] [--But the man didn't falter one bit.]
  9:  174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  177| [45] ["!?"]
 11:  242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  245| [45] [{Don't move!!!!!!}]
 13:  250| [45] [He tried one more time, but the man showed no hint of any change.]
 14:  255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  256| [45] [(It's not working! Is he withstanding it!?)]
 16:  282| [47] [Man]
 17:  285| [45] ["... Telepathy, eh? You caught me off guard back there, but it's not going to work again."]
 18:  393| [45] [And with that, the man leapt at Natsuhiko.]
 19:  401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  404| [45] ["Aghh!!"]
 21:  493| [45] [The man grabbed him by the neck and pulled him in with frightening strength.]
 22:  498| [45] [His fierce glare pierced Natsuhiko like a sword.]
 23:  506| [47] [Man]
 24:  509| [45] ["What happened to the girl?"]
 25:  517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  520| [45] ["... Who gives a damn?"]
 27:  525| [45] [The moment he answered that,]
 28:  608| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  611| [45] ["!!"]
 30:  616| [45] [the man's fist sank into Natsuhiko's gut.]
 31:  624| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  627| [45] ["Gah... hah..."]
 33:  632| [45] [It felt as if his stomach had ruptured. He couldn't breathe.]
 34:  654| [45] [The man quietly scanned the room and took notice of the broken control panel.]
 35:  681| [47] [Man]
 36:  684| [45] ["Tch... clever kid!"]
 37:  763| [45] [The man clicked his tongue and beat Natsuhiko in the face.]
 38:  771| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  774| [45] ["...!!!"]
 40:  779| [45] [Lights flashed before Natsuhiko's eyes and for a moment, his consciousness threatened to cut out.]
 41:  784| [45] [He heard the man's voice through the ringing in his ears.]
 42:  811| [47] [Man]
 43:  814| [45] ["You damn Communicators really rub me the wrong way...!"]
 44:  822| [47] [Man]
 45:  825| [45] ["So even a pack of monsters like you can value your friends, huh?"]
 46:  833| [47] [Man]
 47:  836| [45] ["I didn't know you monsters even had it in you."]
 48:  841| [45] [The man's voice was full of pitch black hate.]
 49:  846| [45] [Ena's words played back in Natsuhiko's ear.]
 50:  935| [45] ["What supports Q's belief is a hatred of the unknown."]
 51:  940| [45] ["The mere thought that 'they're not like us' is enough to incite them to hate others, ostracize them, and injure them. Their mentality is abnormal...!"]
 52: 1017| [45] [He felt like he'd caught a glimpse of that mentality now.]
 53: 1022| [45] [--So Natsuhiko stood up to fight against that hatred.]
 54: 1030| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1033| [45] ["O-of course we do...!"]
 56: 1041| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1044| [45] ["I don't know why you hate us so much! Communicators are people too!"]
 58: 1052| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1055| [45] ["But we don't hate ordinary people without reason!"]
 60: 1063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1066| [45] ["We don't set towns on fire. We don't set bombs. And we don't shoot people indiscriminately, either!"]
 62: 1074| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1077| [45] ["We're not like you, you terrorists!"]
 64: 1101| [47] [Man]
 65: 1102| [45] ["--"]
 66: 1107| [45] [Natsuhiko could hear the man gasp.]
 67: 1112| [45] [Eventually, the man smiled and his voice echoed.]
 68: 1139| [47] [Man]
 69: 1142| [45] ["Khh... khahahah... hahahahahah!!"]
 70: 1169| [47] [Man]
 71: 1172| [45] ["Well, no shit! No proper human would!"]
 72: 1199| [47] [Man]
 73: 1202| [45] ["But it's pretty ballsy of you to say that to my face, kid. Your kind killed over a hundred people!!"]
 74: 1210| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1213| [45] ["!?"]
 76: 1218| [45] [Natsuhiko's eyes widened at those words.]
 77: 1223| [45] [The man tightened his grip around Natsuhiko's neck and continued.]
 78: 1250| [47] [Man]
 79: 1253| [45] ["Look, you Communicator... Even if you don't know it, I've got a perfectly good reason to hate your kind."]
 80: 1261| [47] [Man]
 81: 1264| [45] ["You have precious friends, right? Well there was someone who was more precious to me than anyone else."]
 82: 1272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1275| [45] ["Wh... what are you... talking about...!?"]
 84: 1302| [47] [Man]
 85: 1305| [45] ["You don't know? Nah, of course you don't. What's one more dead kid in a list of 118 casualties?"]
 86: 1313| [47] [Man]
 87: 1316| [45] ["But that kid was my other half. My very mirror image."]
 88: 1324| [47] [Man]
 89: 1327| [45] ["Weak, but motivated. Stupid, but gentle. The very embodiment of light to me."]
 90: 1335| [47] [Man]
 91: 1338| [45] ["But that light died. And all that's left is a dark shadow."]
 92: 1365| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1368| [45] ["... That's me. That's Watase Kasasagi."]
 94: 1376| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1379| [45] ["Burn that name into your ears. Carve it into your mind. Reflect on that name until the moment you die!!"]
 96: 1384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1385| [45] [(W... Watase Kasasagi...!?)]
 98: 1390| [45] [It was a name he had never heard before.]
 99: 1395| [45] [Natsuhiko had no idea what the man was talking about.]
100: 1447| [45] [But the man didn't sweat the details as he slipped the gun out from his waist.]
101: 1452| [45] [At that moment, Natsuhiko froze.]
102: 1457| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1458| [45] [(He's gonna shoot!?)]
104: 1463| [45] [All doubt flew away from his mind.]
105: 1468| [45] [And in its place-- he recalled a conversation he once had with Salyu.]
106: 1549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1552| [45] ["--You threw that security guard today, didn't you? Do you think I can learn to do that too?"]
108: 1578| [47] [Salyu]
109: 1581| [45] ["Dabbling just a bit in martial arts won't help much. But there are techniques that even amateurs can use."]
110: 1607| [47] [Salyu]
111: 1610| [45] ["If someone tries to grab you by the neck--"]
112: 1694| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1695| [45] [("If someone tries to grab you by the neck"--!!)]
114: 1700| [45] [As soon as he remembered,]
115: 1705| [45] [Natsuhiko's body moved on its own.]
116: 1738| [47] [Watase]
117: 1741| [45] ["!?"]
118: 1746| [45] [He grabbed the man's wrist back--]
119: 1839| [45] [--and nimbly wrapped around behind him.]
120: 1847| [47] [Watase]
121: 1850| [45] ["Guh...!?"]
122: 1855| [45] [The man braced his legs.]
123: 1860| [45] [But with a vigorous yell,]
124: 1868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1871| [45] ["Dyaaaahhh!"]
126: 2055| [45] [Natsuhiko threw the man down.]
127: 2063| [47] [Watase]
128: 2066| [45] ["Gagh!!"]
129: 2071| [45] [The man's body struck the floor.]
130: 2076| [45] [That was the shihonage-- the only technique Salyu taught him.]
131: 2081| [45] [As he fell, something dropped from the man's pocket--]
132: 2136| [45] [--A card with "Lv. N" written on it--]
133: 2141| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2142| [45] [(A security card! If I just break it!!)]
135: 2167| [45] [Natsuhiko picked up the card and snapped it in two.]
136: 2220| [45] [And at the same time, the man got up.]
137: 2225| [45] [He was still holding the gun in his hand.]
138: 2230| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 2231| [45] [(Is he going to shoot!? No--)]
140: 2236| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2237| [45] [(If I keep running away, I can trap him!)]
142: 2251| [45] [Natsuhiko turned back and tried to dash out of the room.]
143: 2277| [45] [But then a gunshot rang out,]
144: 2339| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2342| [45] ["!!"]
146: 2347| [45] [and Natsuhiko's left arm popped.]
147: 2359| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2362| [45] ["Gggghhhhh!!"]
149: 2367| [45] [He shouted against his will.]
150: 2372| [45] [He was struck by intense pain as if he had been hit by a blunt force weapon in the upper arm and his brain were burning.]
151: 2380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2383| [45] ["Gugh, uugh..."]
153: 2391| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2394| [45] ["... Uwaaaahhhh!!"]
155: 2399| [45] [Natsuhiko withstood the intense pain and tumbled out of the room.]
156: 2462| [45] [He ran into the fire, applying pressure to his arm.]
157: 2467| [45] [He took the split card and threw it into the blazing flames.]
158: 2472| [45] [A shout shot up from behind him.]
159: 2579| [47] [Watase]
160: 2582| [45] ["You think you can break my card and lock me in so I can't chase you, huh?"]
161: 2587| [45] [Natsuhiko looked back to see the man standing behind the flames.]
162: 2592| [45] [The man took out another card from his pocket to replace the one Natsuhiko destroyed.]
163: 2600| [47] [Watase]
164: 2603| [45] ["Too bad that wasn't my only card. I came prepared."]
165: 2661| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2664| [45] ["...!"]
167: 2672| [47] [Watase]
168: 2675| [45] ["So don't even think you're getting away, Communicator!!"]
169: 2683| [47] [Watase]
170: 2686| [45] ["I will find you, and I will kill you! I swear!"]
171: 2691| [45] [Natsuhiko shook off that voice and ran.]
172: 2696| [45] [And thus began his desperate fight for his life in the underground facility without an exit.]
173: 2843| [45] [He ran recklessly through the factory towards another area.]
174: 2848| [45] [But that area was also wrapped in flames, the heat waves tormenting Natsuhiko.]
175: 2853| [45] [As he ran, his breathing grew rough. Blood oozed out of his arm and side. His body was gradually losing strength.]
176: 2858| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2859| [45] [(D-dammit... What do I do?)]
178: 2864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2865| [45] [(How do I defeat him...!?)]
180: 2870| [45] [The telepathy attacks weren't working on him.]
181: 2875| [45] [His heart obviously wasn't open, so Natsuhiko couldn't use empathy.]
182: 2880| [45] [And the throwing techniques weren't enough to do any real damage.]
183: 2885| [45] [No matter how much Natsuhiko kept running, he would be overtaken and shot to death.]
184: 2924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2925| [45] [(If I at least had some sort of weapon...!)]
186: 2947| [45] [He looked around and soon realized--]
187: 2952| [45] [--he could use the fires surrounding him as a weapon!]
188: 2972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 2975| [45] ["...!"]
190: 3001| [45] [Natsuhiko kicked the burning wall with all his strength.]
191: 3006| [45] [The wallboard tore off and fell to the floor.]
192: 3011| [45] [He held the board to the fire, setting it aflame as a sort of makeshift torch.]
193: 3079| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 3080| [45] [(It's do or die, huh... If I could just hit him in the face with this...!)]
195: 3085| [45] [If it worked out, he could blind the man.]
196: 3090| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko hid himself under cover.]
197: 3101| [45] [Eventually, he heard the area gate open.]
198: 3161| [45] [Heavy footsteps approached.]
199: 3166| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 3167| [45] [(Wait for it... Don't go until the last second.)]
201: 3172| [45] [Natsuhiko lowered his breath, concealed himself completely, and waited for the right timing--]
202: 3227| [45] [--and then he jumped out of cover and hurled the burning board at the man's face.]
203: 3266| [47] [Watase]
204: 3269| [45] ["!"]
205: 3274| [45] [The man shrank back for a second.]
206: 3279| [45] [The board flew towards his face--]
207: 3325| [45] [But right before impact, he swatted it out of the air with his arm.]
208: 3333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3336| [45] ["Ah..."]
210: 3362| [47] [Watase]
211: 3365| [45] ["... What was that supposed to be?"]
212: 3373| [47] [Watase]
213: 3376| [45] ["Please, you didn't think this would defeat me, did you?"]
214: 3381| [45] [The man spoke in disappointment as he casually shot his gun.]
215: 3410| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3413| [45] ["!!"]
217: 3418| [45] [A third bullet gouged itself into Natsuhiko's body, this time in the right leg.]
218: 3471| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 3474| [45] ["Khh... guh...!!"]
220: 3479| [45] [He leaned against the wall.]
221: 3520| [45] [But he put up with the pain and forced his legs to run away.]
222: 3525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 3526| [45] [(Is he going to shoot me in the back!?)]
224: 3531| [45] [He thought so, but the man did not.]
225: 3536| [45] [Instead of a gunshot, he heard a scoffing voice.]
226: 3565| [47] [Watase]
227: 3568| [45] ["Don't think I'll just -give- you the repose of death."]
228: 3576| [47] [Watase]
229: 3579| [45] ["That's it. Run, run, run, you damn Communicator."]
230: 3605| [47] [Watase]
231: 3608| [45] ["Just like how we ran in the hospital that night."]
232: 3648| [45] [The man kept speaking unintelligibly as he made his leisurely pursuit.]
233: 3653| [45] [Natsuhiko's voice overflowed with bitterness.]
234: 3667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3670| [45] ["... Dammit...!"]
236: 3678| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 3681| [45] ["Dammit, dammit, dammit...!"]
238: 3686| [45] [Natsuhiko cursed over and over as he ran for his life.]
239: 3691| [45] [Searching for a way to defeat the man and survive.]
240: 3696| [45] [Searching for a glimmer of hope in the midst of despair--]
