  1:    8| [47] [Watase]
  2:   11| [45] ["...!"]
  3:   16| [45] [Kazami's pained statement was absolutely correct.]
  4:   21| [45] [But Watase couldn't accept that.]
  5:   26| [47] [Watase]
  6:   27| [45] [(... Moribe and I are buddies...)]
  7:   32| [47] [Watase]
  8:   33| [45] [(Even though she doubts me and thinks I've betrayed her trust...)]
  9:   38| [47] [Watase]
 10:   39| [45] [(There's no way in hell I could let myself run away from her!)]
 11:   44| [45] [Watase steeled himself and turned to Kazami.]
 12:   52| [47] [Watase]
 13:   55| [45] ["Tachibana... take care of those kids."]
 14:   81| [47] [Kazami]
 15:   84| [45] ["!? What are you thinking!?"]
 16:   92| [47] [Watase]
 17:   95| [45] ["I'm gonna bet all or nothing on persuading her! Don't follow me, you hear!?"]
 18:  100| [45] [Watase left Natsuhiko in Kazami's capable hands--]
 19:  105| [45] [And leapt out from the shadow of the passageway.]
 20:  189| [47] [Watase]
 21:  192| [45] ["Moribe!"]
 22:  200| [47] [Jun]
 23:  203| [45] ["!!"]
 24:  209| [45] [Jun's body shook with a start.]
 25:  214| [45] [She gripped the engine cutter firmly and stared at Watase.]
 26:  263| [47] [Jun]
 27:  266| [45] ["... Captain."]
 28:  274| [47] [Watase]
 29:  277| [45] ["Moribe, what do you think you're doing with that thing?"]
 30:  285| [47] [Jun]
 31:  288| [45] ["What, you ask...?"]
 32:  296| [47] [Jun]
 33:  299| [45] ["You're asking me that...?"]
 34:  307| [47] [Watase]
 35:  310| [45] ["...!"]
 36:  318| [47] [Watase]
 37:  321| [45] ["Moribe... were you the one who broke the door to that office?"]
 38:  326| [47] [Jun]
 39:  327| [45] ["..."]
 40:  332| [45] [Watase took her silence as a "yes".]
 41:  337| [45] [He could tell that a look of sorrow was forming on his face.]
 42:  342| [47] [Watase]
 43:  343| [45] [(... Goddammit.)]
 44:  348| [45] [The Jun who was prowling the facility while muttering curses and wielding a tool of destruction-- she seemed like a totally different person from the Jun he knew.]
 45:  353| [45] [The Jun who kept on running around and doing her best in spite of her small stature.]
 46:  358| [45] [The Jun who plunged right into the contaminated zone alongside him without any concern for her own safety.]
 47:  363| [45] [The Jun who chose this line of work in order to save people in spite of the wounds she carried on her heart and back from Nagisa's death--]
 48:  368| [47] [Watase]
 49:  369| [45] [(So why...!?)]
 50:  377| [47] [Watase]
 51:  380| [45] ["Why the hell... do you need to carry that thing around!?"]
 52:  385| [45] [Jun gave Watase a sad smile after she heard his shouts.]
 53:  393| [47] [Jun]
 54:  396| [45] ["... You see, Captain, it just hit me all of a sudden."]
 55:  404| [47] [Jun]
 56:  407| [45] ["You can't protect everyone in this screwed-up place without getting your hands dirty."]
 57:  415| [47] [Jun]
 58:  418| [45] ["So I'll...!"]
 59:  426| [47] [Watase]
 60:  429| [45] ["Stop it! That's not the right way!"]
 61:  434| [45] [Watase walked up to Jun.]
 62:  439| [45] [Her face froze over at that action.]
 63:  493| [47] [Jun]
 64:  496| [45] ["Captain! Stay back!"]
 65:  504| [47] [Jun]
 66:  507| [45] ["I don't trust you either! I won't be able to stop myself if you get any closer!"]
 67:  525| [47] [Watase]
 68:  528| [45] ["Shut up! If you're gonna kill me, then do it already!"]
 69:  533| [45] [Resolution filled Jun's eyes. Watase was just 5 m away from her.]
 70:  538| [45] [Watase took another step forward. Just then, Kazami shouted from behind.]
 71:  546| [47] [Kazami]
 72:  549| [45] ["Captain, it's too dangerous! Fall back!"]
 73:  564| [45] [The resolution in Jun's eyes wavered. Just 3 m left.]
 74:  569| [45] [Watase then slipped right past the engine cutter--]
 75:  574| [45] [Then leapt at Jun.]
 76:  635| [47] [Jun]
 77:  638| [45] ["--!!"]
 78:  754| [45] [Jun gasped.]
 79:  759| [45] [Watase embraced her.]
 80:  767| [47] [Jun]
 81:  770| [45] ["H... huh?"]
 82:  778| [47] [Watase]
 83:  781| [45] ["What's wrong? Aren't you going to kill me...?"]
 84:  789| [47] [Watase]
 85:  792| [45] ["I'd be fine with it if you were the one who ended up killing me."]
 86:  800| [47] [Jun]
 87:  803| [45] ["...!"]
 88:  808| [45] [Jun's body froze right up.]
 89:  858| [47] [Jun]
 90:  861| [45] ["Are you being serious...?"]
 91:  869| [47] [Watase]
 92:  872| [45] ["Half-serious, yeah. But--"]
 93:  880| [47] [Watase]
 94:  883| [45] ["But I believe that you're not that kind of woman."]
 95:  891| [47] [Jun]
 96:  894| [45] ["You believe in me? On what grounds?"]
 97:  902| [47] [Jun]
 98:  905| [45] ["You don't know a thing about me."]
 99:  913| [47] [Watase]
100:  916| [45] ["Yes I do. You're my buddy-- my partner who's always got my back."]
101:  924| [47] [Watase]
102:  927| [45] ["I trust you even if you don't trust me. That won't change."]
103:  932| [45] [Just then-- Jun breathed a silent breath.]
104:  980| [47] [Jun]
105:  983| [45] ["I see... So that's how it is, huh?"]
106:  991| [47] [Jun]
107:  994| [45] ["So you're my buddy no matter how much I doubt you, huh..."]
108:  999| [45] [The edge in Jun's voice had vanished.]
109: 1004| [45] [Watase carefully chose his words as he spoke.]
110: 1012| [47] [Watase]
111: 1015| [45] ["... If you truly believe that... then please stop before you do something you'll regret."]
112: 1023| [47] [Watase]
113: 1026| [45] ["You're a rescue worker, right? Isn't it your job to save people?"]
114: 1035| [47] [Jun]
115: 1038| [45] ["Yeah..."]
116: 1046| [47] [Jun]
117: 1049| [45] ["... That's why I..."]
118: 1189| [47] [Jun]
119: 1192| [45] ["... can't do what you say!"]
120: 1200| [47] [Watase]
121: 1203| [45] ["!!"]
122: 1208| [45] [Watase's eyes widened]
123: 1294| [45] [just as Jun pushed him away from her.]
124: 1302| [47] [Watase]
125: 1305| [45] ["Ghh!!"]
126: 1310| [45] [Watase was taken by surprise and fell to the floor.]
127: 1315| [47] [Watase]
128: 1316| [45] [(Shit! Is she really gonna kill me!?)]
129: 1321| [45] [Watase looked up in shock.]
130: 1369| [45] [But Jun's next attack never came.]
131: 1374| [45] [She just took a step back and looked at Watase.]
132: 1436| [47] [Jun]
133: 1439| [45] ["... You're right. A rescue worker's job -is- to save lives."]
134: 1447| [47] [Jun]
135: 1450| [45] ["But that's exactly why I've gotta do this."]
136: 1458| [47] [Watase]
137: 1461| [45] ["Huh...?"]
138: 1469| [47] [Jun]
139: 1472| [45] ["... It's okay if you don't understand."]
140: 1498| [47] [Jun]
141: 1501| [45] ["You and the Lieutenant better get going now. I don't want to talk about this, you know..."]
142: 1506| [45] [Those words shook the foundation of Watase's beliefs.]
143: 1511| [45] [She talked like Watase wasn't her target.]
144: 1519| [47] [Watase]
145: 1522| [45] ["Mo... Moribe!? Just what are you after!?"]
146: 1530| [47] [Jun]
147: 1533| [45] ["... I can't tell you. You're the one person I don't want knowing about what I'm about to do."]
148: 1541| [47] [Watase]
149: 1544| [45] ["...!?"]
150: 1570| [47] [Jun]
151: 1573| [45] ["But I'll just say this:"]
152: 1581| [47] [Jun]
153: 1584| [45] ["... You and I are no longer buddies."]
154: 1623| [45] [Jun then turned around and broke off into a run down the connecting passageway.]
155: 1680| [47] [Watase]
156: 1683| [45] ["M-Moribe, wait!"]
157: 1691| [47] [Watase]
158: 1694| [45] ["Please tell me what you're doing--!"]
159: 1856| [45] [But Jun refused to answer that question--]
160: 1861| [45] [--and disappeared behind the security gate.]
161: 1873| [45] [Watase soon heard the sound of Kazami running up to him.]
162: 1938| [47] [Kazami]
163: 1941| [45] ["Captain! Are you all right!?"]
164: 1946| [45] [Watase didn't answer her. He just stared at the shut security gate.]
165: 1954| [47] [Watase]
166: 1957| [45] ["Wha... what the hell just happened...!?"]
167: 1983| [47] [Kazami]
168: 1986| [45] ["... I don't know. However..."]
169: 1994| [47] [Kazami]
170: 1997| [45] ["She's gone back to the way she was just a few minutes ago. I never dreamed she would ever act this way...!"]
171: 2002| [45] [Lament filled Kazami's face.]
172: 2007| [45] [Watase wrapped his arms around her shoulders and spoke.]
173: 2015| [47] [Watase]
174: 2018| [45] ["I'm sorry... I totally failed to persuade her."]
175: 2026| [47] [Watase]
176: 2029| [45] ["Old man Ukita might have heard the ruckus and be on his way over now... We need to get away from here for now."]
177: 2055| [47] [Kazami]
178: 2058| [45] ["Yes..."]
179: 2112| [45] [--Watase and Kazami carried Natsuhiko and Salyu on their backs again and ran down the passageway.]
180: 2117| [45] [They looked around for a place to hide without stopping.]
181: 2130| [45] [They fled into the Area 3 connecting passageway and closed the gate before Kazami chose to speak up in a frightened voice.]
182: 2192| [47] [Kazami]
183: 2195| [45] ["But... where do you think we should run?"]
184: 2203| [47] [Kazami]
185: 2206| [45] ["Is there even a single safe place in this facility...?"]
186: 2211| [47] [Watase]
187: 2212| [45] ["..."]
188: 2217| [45] [While they didn't know what Jun's motive was, they couldn't let their guard down so long as she had her engine cutter.]
189: 2222| [45] [If her target happened to be Natsuhiko or Salyu-- then they'd be screwed no matter what room they hid in. She'd just break down the door.]
190: 2230| [47] [Watase]
191: 2233| [45] ["... But if we keep running around with these kids on our backs, we're gonna get caught eventually...!"]
