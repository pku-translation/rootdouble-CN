  1:  147| [45] [A thought made its way into Watase's faint consciousness.]
  2:  164| [47] [Watase]
  3:  165| [45] [(How... did it... come to this...?)]
  4:  182| [47] [Watase]
  5:  183| [45] [(Did I... do something wrong...?)]
  6:  200| [45] [Thinking about it wouldn't yield an answer. He didn't know a thing.]
  7:  249| [45] [--Way too many bizarre incidents had occurred in the past six hours.]
  8:  254| [45] [The sights and mysteries he'd witnessed up until that point flickered before his mind's eye.]
  9:  306| [45] [The loss of his memories.]
 10:  354| [45] [The nine of them being trapped in the facility.]
 11:  404| [45] [The murder victims they'd found.]
 12:  454| [45] [The survivor who'd run away from him time after time.]
 13:  504| [45] [The wrecked cargo lift and the body of the unidentified girl.]
 14:  552| [45] [The disappearance of their AD stock.]
 15:  647| [45] [The loss of any rhyme or reason to everything his companions said and did.]
 16:  697| [45] [The lack of any fires or nuclear reactor in Area N, and finding Natsuhiko on the brink of death instead.]
 17:  747| [45] [And-- the discovery and subsequent disappearance of Yuuri's body.]
 18:  793| [47] [Watase]
 19:  794| [45] [(Was all of that... actually... real...?)]
 20:  799| [45] [He wasn't even sure of that anymore.]
 21:  804| [47] [Watase]
 22:  805| [45] [(But if it was real... then what the hell happened here...?)]
 23:  810| [47] [Watase]
 24:  811| [45] [(Where'd Yuuri's body go...?)]
 25:  816| [45] [Kazami, Jun, Ena, Ukita-- and Yuuri.]
 26:  821| [45] [The faces of all those people who Watase had met up until that point materialized in his brain.]
 27:  826| [47] [Watase]
 28:  827| [45] [(... No, that's not all.)]
 29:  832| [47] [Watase]
 30:  833| [45] [(What happened to the 9th survivor...)]
 31:  838| [47] [Watase]
 32:  839| [45] [(Where's "Mashiro Toba"...?)]
 33:  886| [45] [He didn't want to doubt anyone.]
 34:  897| [45] [But everyone was suspicious.]
 35:  908| [47] [Watase]
 36:  909| [45] [(I can't help but think that someone set things up so they'd end this way...!)]
 37:  920| [45] [But who was the mastermind?]
 38:  931| [45] [All that he knew for sure was that it wasn't him.]
 39:  942| [45] [And then--]
 40:  953| [47] [Watase]
 41:  954| [45] [(It can't be Natsuhiko... he was dying in here...)]
 42:  965| [47] [Watase]
 43:  966| [45] [(So... I want to make sure that at least he can get out of here...!)]
 44:  977| [45] [But Watase's consciousness was growing fainter by the second.]
 45:  988| [45] [Just before he lost consciousness--]
 46:  998| [45] [--It happened.]
 47: 1033| [45] [He heard the beating of a heart.]
 48: 1064| [47] [Watase]
 49: 1065| [45] [(!?)]
 50: 1096| [45] [For a moment, he thought it was his own heartbeat.]
 51: 1144| [45] [But-- that wasn't the case.]
 52: 1149| [45] [That sound appeared to be coming from somewhere closer.]
 53: 1213| [45] [He could sense that something was moving next to him.]
 54: 1218| [47] [Watase]
 55: 1219| [45] [(It... it can't be...!)]
 56: 1224| [45] [Watase forced his eyes open and looked that way.]
 57: 1289| [45] [-He- was standing there.]
 58: 1375| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1376| [45] [(Wh... why...!?)]
 60: 1425| [45] [The boy who was supposed to be on the brink of death was standing tall and glaring down at Watase with wide eyes.]
 61: 1430| [45] [Why had he woken up so suddenly? Why was he glaring at Watase?]
 62: 1479| [45] [Watase lay there without a single answer to any of those questions...]
 63: 1484| [45] [The boy then spoke to him.]
 64: 1537| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1540| [45] ["--Get up."]
 66: 1548| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1551| [45] ["None of this is over yet...!"]
 68: 1599| [45] [--But at the same time he registered Natsuhiko's voice--]
 69: 1604| [45] [Watase's consciousness faded into darkness.]
