  1:   65| [45] [--But even so--]
  2:   70| [45] [Natsuhiko could by no means come to a decision.]
  3:   75| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   76| [45] [(It's no good... I can't choose...!)]
  5:   81| [45] [He had been thinking he'd stay behind himself, but when it came down to it, even that choice was difficult to make.]
  6:   86| [45] [That said, he couldn't bring himself to sacrifice anyone else, either.]
  7:   91| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:   92| [45] [(Dammit! What kind of sick joke is this situation!?)]
  9:   97| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:   98| [45] [(We finally got everyone all together, and yet...!)]
 11:  103| [45] [Time ticked down second by second.]
 12:  108| [45] [Despair descended upon Natsuhiko's mind.]
 13:  116| [45] [But at that moment-- Jun spoke up.]
 14:  184| [47] [Jun]
 15:  187| [45] ["It's okay, Natsuhiko. There's no need for you to worry yourself about it."]
 16:  195| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  198| [45] ["Huh?"]
 18:  203| [45] [Natsuhiko looked up to see Jun smiling at him.]
 19:  229| [47] [Jun]
 20:  232| [45] ["Guess it's really times like these where us rescue workers gotta shine."]
 21:  258| [47] [Jun]
 22:  261| [45] ["Ain't that right, Captain? Sis?"]
 23:  294| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  297| [45] ["H-hold on a second, Moribe!"]
 25:  323| [47] [Ukita]
 26:  326| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi aside, there shouldn't be any reason for either you or Lieutenant Tachibana to be sacrificed!"]
 27:  381| [47] [Jun]
 28:  384| [45] ["No, you're wrong, Mr. Ukita."]
 29:  410| [47] [Jun]
 30:  413| [45] ["In fact, it's wrong to think that anybody has to be sacrificed in the first place."]
 31:  439| [47] [Jun]
 32:  442| [45] ["We're not sacrificing anybody."]
 33:  468| [47] [Jun]
 34:  471| [45] ["I mean, we've gone through harsh training each day to prevent that."]
 35:  479| [47] [Jun]
 36:  482| [45] ["It might be impossible for other people, but I'm sure the three of us can find a way outta here."]
 37:  508| [47] [Jun]
 38:  511| [45] ["So... us members of Sirius will stay behind."]
 39:  516| [45] [There was not a shred of doubt in Jun's eyes as she made her declaration.]
 40:  521| [45] [And as if her sentiment had propagated to them, Watase and Kazami smiled.]
 41:  554| [47] [Watase]
 42:  557| [45] ["... You're right."]
 43:  590| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  593| [45] ["Yes... that certainly is true."]
 45:  619| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  622| [45] ["That seems like a safer wager than my proposal."]
 47:  630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  633| [45] ["B-but...!"]
 49:  656| [45] [They had been searching for a way to escape LABO all this time.]
 50:  661| [45] [However, they hadn't found anything in the end.]
 51:  666| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  667| [45] [(And yet they say they can find a way to escape now...? That's just not possible!)]
 53:  672| [45] [As that thought crossed his mind, Jun bonked Natsuhiko on the head.]
 54:  726| [47] [Jun]
 55:  729| [45] ["C'mon. Look, there's no need to worry."]
 56:  755| [47] [Jun]
 57:  758| [45] ["And besides, you've got some girls you gotta protect, don'tcha?"]
 58:  896| [45] [When he heard that, Natsuhiko turned around in shock.]
 59:  987| [45] [Yuuri, Mashiro, and Salyu were looking back at him.]
 60:  992| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  993| [45] [(... True, I do want to protect everyone... but...)]
 62: 1120| [47] [Jun]
 63: 1123| [45] ["C'mon, don't make that face."]
 64: 1149| [47] [Jun]
 65: 1152| [45] ["Though when you've got three girlfriends, I can kinda see why you'd be a little fickle. Ahahahah."]
 66: 1175| [45] [Jun's cheerfulness was a demonstration of her gentleness, her strength, and her resolve.]
 67: 1180| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't help but cry when he realized that.]
 68: 1188| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1191| [45] ["Jun..."]
 70: 1196| [45] [--But he held back his tears.]
 71: 1201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1202| [45] [(Don't cry... There's no need to cry!)]
 73: 1207| [45] [This was not a final farewell.]
 74: 1212| [45] [The rescue workers were simply staying behind in LABO for the time being to ensure everyone's escape.]
 75: 1217| [45] [So Natsuhiko looked at the three of them and spoke resolutely.]
 76: 1225| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1228| [45] ["Jun, Ms. Tachibana, Watase... I believe in you."]
 78: 1254| [47] [Jun]
 79: 1257| [45] ["Yeah. That's all we ask for."]
 80: 1262| [45] [Kazami forced herself to speak cheerfully too.]
 81: 1295| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1298| [45] ["... Sheesh, you sure have been singing your own praises, haven't you?"]
 83: 1353| [47] [Jun]
 84: 1356| [45] ["C'mon, Sis. If a low-ranking rescue worker like me doesn't show off now, when else will I get the chance?"]
 85: 1382| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1385| [45] ["Jun. You're on duty. Please stop calling me 'Sis'."]
 87: 1411| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1414| [45] ["Aww, that's not fair, Sis. You just called me 'Jun' too, y'know!"]
 89: 1440| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1443| [45] ["How many times must I tell you... Sheesh..."]
 91: 1448| [47] [All]
 92: 1451| [45] ["... Hahah."]
 93: 1456| [45] [For at least a fleeting second, that exchange caused everyone to smile and forget the tense situation.]
 94: 1508| [45] [Jun then put on a serious face and spoke to Ena and Ukita.]
 95: 1516| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1519| [45] ["Okay then, Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, take care of the kids for me."]
 97: 1552| [47] [Ena]
 98: 1555| [45] ["Yes, leave them to us."]
 99: 1588| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1591| [45] ["As someone at fault for causing this incident, I too need to take responsibility."]
101: 1617| [47] [Ena]
102: 1620| [45] ["... Oh, and, Ms. Moribe?"]
103: 1646| [47] [Jun]
104: 1649| [45] ["What?"]
105: 1675| [47] [Ena]
106: 1678| [45] ["I'm sorry for being so rude to you today."]
107: 1704| [47] [Ena]
108: 1707| [45] ["You are an excellent rescue worker."]
109: 1783| [47] [Jun]
110: 1786| [45] ["..."]
111: 1809| [45] [Jun's whole face lit up in a smile at those words.]
112: 1814| [45] [She silently nodded and then spoke to everyone.]
113: 1840| [47] [Jun]
114: 1843| [45] ["... All right now people, head on over to the bulkhead in Area 2 as quick as you can!"]
115: 1869| [47] [Jun]
116: 1872| [45] ["The three of us won't have time to find an escape route if you don't!"]
117: 1877| [47] [Kids]
118: 1880| [45] ["Yes!"]
119: 1887| [45] [When it came time to part, the six who would leave spoke to the three who would stay.]
120: 1920| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1923| [45] ["Jun! I really do admire you!"]
122: 1949| [47] [Jun]
123: 1952| [45] ["Aw shucks, that's kinda embarrassing... but thanks."]
124: 2027| [45] [Salyu held Alice out to Jun and spoke.]
125: 2035| [47] [Salyu]
126: 2038| [45] ["Jun. She's precious to me. I don't mind if she breaks, but bring her back to me."]
127: 2088| [47] [Jun]
128: 2091| [45] ["Yeah. I promise."]
129: 2096| [45] [When Jun took Alice, the doll looked at Salyu and cried sadly.]
130: 2101| [47] [Alice]
131: 2104| [45] ["Kyuu..."]
132: 2130| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 2133| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, Ms. Tachibana, Ms. Jun..."]
134: 2160| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 2163| [45] ["I just know you three will escape safely."]
136: 2189| [47] [Kazami]
137: 2192| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri... It might be strange of me to say this, but..."]
138: 2219| [47] [Kazami]
139: 2222| [45] ["Please live life to its fullest, for Nagisa too."]
140: 2248| [47] [Yuuri]
141: 2251| [45] ["... Yes."]
142: 2380| [45] [And finally, Natsuhiko glared and shouted at Watase.]
143: 2388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2391| [45] ["Hey, Watase!"]
145: 2417| [47] [Watase]
146: 2420| [45] ["What now?"]
147: 2428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2431| [45] ["You know what I'm going to say, right...?"]
149: 2439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2442| [45] ["Make sure Jun and Ms. Tachibana escape, even if it costs you your life, you hear!?"]
151: 2468| [47] [Watase]
152: 2471| [45] ["Yeah, I know."]
153: 2479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2482| [45] ["For sure, okay!? Because it's your duty to ensure everyone escapes safely!"]
155: 2508| [47] [Watase]
156: 2511| [45] ["... Leave it to me."]
157: 2516| [45] [Watase answered with a sharp look in his eyes.]
158: 2521| [45] [Out of everyone present, Watase was probably the most aware of how difficult escape would be. ]
159: 2526| [45] [But regardless, Natsuhiko decided to trust his vow.]
160: 2552| [47] [Watase]
161: 2555| [45] ["Now, go, guys!"]
162: 2588| [47] [Jun]
163: 2591| [45] ["We'll open the bulkheads in exactly two minutes!"]
164: 2624| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2627| [45] ["Please hurry! There's no time!"]
166: 2789| [45] [Pressed by the words of the three rescue workers, the other six left the system control room.]
167: 2794| [45] [Before he shut the door, Natsuhiko turned around.]
168: 2878| [45] [He wanted to burn the image of the rescue workers into his eyes.]
169: 2883| [45] [Jun looked back at them.]
170: 2909| [47] [Jun]
171: 2912| [45] ["... It's okay. We won't die."]
172: 2938| [47] [Jun]
173: 2941| [45] ["So let's all meet up again."]
174: 2946| [45] [And as Jun finished saying that--]
175: 3000| [45] [--the door to the system control room shut as if to separate the two groups.]
176: 3048| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 3049| [45] [(Jun, Ms. Tachibana, Watase... I really do believe in you...!)]
178: 3054| [45] [Natsuhiko declared that in his mind before turning around and breaking off into a run.]
179: 3113| [45] [They rushed towards Area 2, supporting each others' wounded bodies.]
180: 3173| [45] [They slipped through Area 3 to get to Area 2.]
181: 3232| [45] [They ran up the emergency staircase,]
182: 3282| [45] [and reached the bulkhead at the 112th second.]
183: 3290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 3293| [45] ["We made it...!"]
185: 3298| [45] [Right after Natsuhiko muttered that-- he heard an electronic sound.]
186: 3335| [45] [And the bulkhead that had been shut this whole time began to open loudly.]
187: 3340| [45] [But none of the six cheered for joy.]
188: 3440| [45] [Perhaps everyone's minds were on the rescue workers who stayed behind.]
189: 3494| [45] [Natsuhiko shook off that feeling to send telepathy to Dr. Tenkawa.]
190: 3555| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 3558| [45] [{Mom, can you hear me?}]
192: 3563| [45] [He then used empathy and waited for her answer.]
193: 3568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 3569| [45] [(Security Sector 6 didn't apprehend her, did they!?)]
195: 3574| [45] [He thought that for a second-- but he soon heard the professor's voice.]
196: 3603| [47] [Miyoko]
197: 3606| [45] [{N-Natsuhiko!?}]
198: 3614| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 3617| [45] [{Good, we connected!}]
200: 3641| [47] [Miyoko]
201: 3644| [45] [{Y-yes! But how did we suddenly connect!?}]
202: 3668| [47] [Miyoko]
203: 3671| [45] [{Wait, did the bulkheads open!?}]
204: 3679| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 3682| [45] [{We neutralized the bulkhead lockdown with your hacking software!}]
206: 3690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 3693| [45] [{We're getting out now! How's the situation over there!?}]
208: 3717| [47] [Miyoko]
209: 3720| [45] [{I was somehow able to get through to the rescue squad!}]
210: 3744| [47] [Miyoko]
211: 3747| [45] [{... Ah! Looks like Security Sector 6 has noticed the bulkheads opening too!}]
212: 3771| [47] [Miyoko]
213: 3774| [45] [{Natsuhiko, get to the entrance as quickly as possible! We'll secure an escape route for you!}]
214: 3837| [45] [The professor's voice was frantic. The situation seemed urgent.]
215: 3897| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3900| [45] ["Let's go, guys! Run for the entrance!"]
217: 3912| [45] [The six of them ran as Natsuhiko shouted that.]
218: 3917| [45] [But soon afterwards, they heard that chilling voice again--]
219: 3966| [47] [Automatic PA]
220: 3969| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
221: 3974| [47] [Automatic PA]
222: 3977| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
223: 3982| [47] [Automatic PA]
224: 3985| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
225: 3996| [45] [--The bulkheads shut behind them.]
226: 4001| [45] [But they dared not look back.]
227: 4012| [45] [They kept on running so as to not betray the feelings of the three who stayed behind of their own accord.]
228: 4017| [45] [Eventually, they began to hear a commotion up in front of them--]
229: 4178| [45] [--The entrance was in tumultuous disarray.]
230: 4183| [45] [Dozens of rescue workers were pushing back a mass of thirty or forty men in protection suits on two sides.]
231: 4188| [45] [And in the center of the parted sea stood a woman--]
232: 4247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 4250| [45] ["Mom!"]
234: 4255| [47] [All 3]
235: 4258| [45] ["Professor!"]
236: 4266| [47] [Miyoko]
237: 4269| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Yuuri, Yui, and Mashiro too!"]
238: 4319| [47] [Miyoko]
239: 4322| [45] ["You got so far despite how tattered you all are... You did so well to...!"]
240: 4327| [45] [The professor abruptly stopped.]
241: 4332| [45] [But she held back her tears and spoke up again.]
242: 4342| [47] [Miyoko]
243: 4345| [45] ["Now go! Get through to the front entrance!"]
244: 4350| [45] [But the moment she said that, Natsuhiko hesitated.]
245: 4358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 4361| [45] ["--W-wait, Mom!"]
247: 4369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 4372| [45] ["There are still three people left down there! And there's a powerful bomb set up that's about to explode!"]
249: 4380| [47] [Miyoko]
250: 4383| [45] ["Huh!?"]
251: 4391| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 4394| [45] ["Is there nothing we can do to save those three!?"]
253: 4402| [47] [Miyoko]
254: 4405| [45] ["At this point, that would be--"]
255: 4410| [45] [She thought for a second, but then spoke up resolutely.]
256: 4418| [47] [Miyoko]
257: 4421| [45] ["--No, anyway, you six need to escape! Even moreso if there's a bomb!"]
258: 4429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 4432| [45] ["No way! But then--"]
260: 4440| [47] [Ena]
261: 4443| [45] ["Let's just go, Mr. Tenkawa! We need to believe in Captain Kasasagi and his squad!"]
262: 4451| [47] [Ukita]
263: 4454| [45] ["Besides, if you don't escape, then all their efforts will have been for nothing! So run! Just run!"]
264: 4459| [45] [Natsuhiko was forced to comply.]
265: 4487| [45] [He withstood the pain of his injuries and ran with all his might.]
266: 4492| [47] [SS6 Member 1]
267: 4495| [45] ["W-wait!"]
268: 4500| [47] [SS6 Member 2]
269: 4503| [45] ["Don't let them get away! After them!"]
270: 4508| [45] [At that moment, the Security Sector 6 crowd surged and kicked away at the rescue workers.]
271: 4513| [45] [But at the same time--]
272: 4525| [45] [The rescue copter came into view on the other side of the entrance!]
273: 4533| [47] [Miyoko]
274: 4536| [45] ["Board that helicopter! Hurry!"]
275: 4603| [45] [With that voice at their backs, the six survivors boarded the helicopter.]
276: 4614| [45] [It began its ascent immediately afterwards.]
277: 4668| [45] [--The one who showed them into the helicopter was a big man.]
278: 4673| [47] [Commander]
279: 4676| [45] ["I'm Sirius Commander Murakami."]
280: 4681| [47] [Commander]
281: 4684| [45] ["I've heard the details from Dr. Tenkawa. You can all relax now."]
282: 4692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 4695| [45] ["Th... thank you."]
284: 4700| [47] [Commander]
285: 4703| [45] ["No need for thanks. More importantly, where are Kasasagi and the others...?"]
286: 4708| [45] [Yuuri jumped at that question and pleaded with the commander.]
287: 4716| [47] [Yuuri]
288: 4719| [45] ["Commander Murakami, please! You need to do something to save them!"]
289: 4724| [47] [Commander]
290: 4727| [45] ["What!?"]
291: 4732| [45] [--Yuuri explained to the commander what had happened in LABO.]
292: 4830| [45] [How the three rescue workers stayed behind to save them.]
293: 4982| [45] [How an undefusable bomb was set to explode before the lockdown end time.]
294: 4987| [45] [And finally how there was little hope for their escape--]
295: 5005| [47] [Yuuri]
296: 5008| [45] ["--So please, there has to be a way to make an escape route for them externally!"]
297: 5013| [47] [Commander]
298: 5016| [45] ["... I'm sorry, but I cannot consent to that."]
299: 5021| [47] [Commander]
300: 5024| [45] ["Doing so would endanger the lives of the rescue workers as well."]
301: 5029| [47] [Commander]
302: 5032| [45] ["I can't send an order like that to the units under my own jurisdiction."]
303: 5040| [47] [Yuuri]
304: 5043| [45] ["N-no...!"]
305: 5051| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 5054| [45] ["Then is there nothing we can do for Watase and the others!?"]
307: 5059| [47] [Commander]
308: 5062| [45] ["... We can... believe in them."]
309: 5067| [47] [Commander]
310: 5070| [45] ["Naturally, I too believe that Kasasagi and the others will return alive."]
311: 5075| [45] [--After those words were spoken, an ominous silence fell upon them.]
312: 5080| [45] [Ena muttered in bitter opposition of that silence.]
313: 5088| [47] [Ena]
314: 5091| [45] ["He's right... Let's believe in them, Ms. Yuuri."]
315: 5099| [47] [Ena]
316: 5102| [45] ["Let's believe that they'll escape from LABO."]
317: 5107| [45] [Everyone else started speaking up in reply.]
318: 5115| [47] [Mashiro]
319: 5118| [45] ["I believe too."]
320: 5126| [47] [Ukita]
321: 5129| [45] ["... Me too."]
322: 5137| [47] [Salyu]
323: 5140| [45] ["Me too... We made a promise after all. Jun said she'd come back with Alice."]
324: 5145| [45] [That was everyone's prayer.]
325: 5150| [45] [All they could do was pray in that hopeless situation.]
326: 5155| [45] [And that's why-- Natsuhiko prayed with all of his heart as well.]
327: 5163| [47] [Natsuhiko]
328: 5166| [45] ["Yeah, I believe too..."]
329: 5174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
330: 5177| [45] ["I believe we'll see those three again alive for sure...!"]
331: 5182| [45] [The commander had the rescue copter circle above LABO.]
332: 5187| [45] [That was the least he could do as he prayed for his subordinates' safety.]
333: 5192| [45] [Seconds ticked away as they approached the time of detonation.]
334: 5197| [45] [Natsuhiko held a finger to his temple as he sent full-power telepathy.]
335: 5258| [45] [--3 minutes remaining--]
336: 5266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 5269| [45] [{Please, Watase! If you can hear me, please answer!}]
338: 5276| [45] [--1 minute remaining--]
339: 5284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
340: 5287| [45] [{Watase, can't you hear me!? Have you escaped yet?}]
341: 5292| [45] [--30 seconds remaining--]
342: 5300| [47] [Natsuhiko]
343: 5303| [45] [{Dumbass! The hell are you dragging your feet for!?}]
344: 5308| [45] [--10 seconds remaining--]
345: 5316| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 5319| [45] [{Hey, hurry up and answer my telepathy!}]
347: 5324| [45] [--5, 4, 3, 2, 1--]
348: 5332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
349: 5335| [45] [{Watase!! Please, just answer me--!!}]
350: 5340| [45] [Natsuhiko wished for an answer, and the very next moment--]
351: 5434| [47] [All]
352: 5437| [45] ["Aaah!"]
353: 5442| [45] [A thunderous roar and an intense impact shook the entire helicopter.]
354: 5447| [45] [And outside the window--]
355: 5592| [45] [--was LABO, engulfed in smoke...]
356: 5653| [47] [Natsuhiko]
357: 5656| [45] ["... N-no...!"]
358: 5661| [45] [Natsuhiko's hollow voice echoed inside the helicopter.]
359: 5747| [47] [Jun]
360: 5750| [45] ["It might be impossible for other people, but I'm sure the three of us can find a way outta here."]
361: 5770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
362: 5773| [45] ["N... no way... How...?"]
363: 5825| [47] [Kazami]
364: 5828| [45] ["Jun. You're on duty. Please stop calling me 'Sis'."]
365: 5855| [47] [Jun]
366: 5858| [45] ["Aww, that's not fair, Sis. You just called me 'Jun' too, y'know!"]
367: 5885| [47] [Kazami]
368: 5888| [45] ["How many times must I tell you... Sheesh..."]
369: 5893| [47] [All]
370: 5896| [45] ["... Hahah."]
371: 5916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
372: 5919| [45] ["But... we were laughing together just minutes ago..."]
373: 5987| [47] [Jun]
374: 5990| [45] ["... It's okay. We won't die."]
375: 6017| [47] [Jun]
376: 6020| [45] ["So let's all meet up again."]
377: 6041| [47] [Natsuhiko]
378: 6044| [45] ["We promised to meet again..."]
379: 6049| [45] [Eventually, Ena spoke up in a quivering voice.]
380: 6057| [47] [Ena]
381: 6060| [45] ["... Remember what Ms. Moribe said...?"]
382: 6068| [47] [Ena]
383: 6071| [45] ["They risk their lives for their work..."]
384: 6079| [47] [Ena]
385: 6082| [45] ["But... but still...!"]
386: 6129| [47] [Yuuri]
387: 6132| [45] ["*sob*... Jun... Ms. Tachibana... Captain Kasasagi."]
388: 6140| [47] [Mashiro]
389: 6143| [45] ["... Jun... Thank you... I'm sorry..."]
390: 6151| [47] [Ukita]
391: 6154| [45] ["Khh... ughh...!"]
392: 6162| [47] [Salyu]
393: 6165| [45] ["... But you said... you'd bring Alice back..."]
394: 6170| [45] [As he heard everyone sob--]
395: 6175| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth as a way to cope with his pent up rage.]
396: 6255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
397: 6256| [45] [(... Why, Watase? Why...)]
398: 6261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
399: 6262| [45] [(You said "leave it to me" didn't you...?)]
400: 6267| [47] [Natsuhiko]
401: 6268| [45] [(You said... you'd make sure Jun and Ms. Tachibana got out of there, didn't you?)]
402: 6273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
403: 6274| [45] [(You promised me. You promised them, didn't you...?)]
404: 6279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
405: 6280| [45] [(So why, Watase... Why...?)]
406: 6285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
407: 6286| [45] [(Why...)]
408: 6291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
409: 6292| [45] [(Ghh...)]
410: 6311| [47] [Natsuhiko]
411: 6314| [45] [{... Tell me, Watase.}]
412: 6322| [47] [Natsuhiko]
413: 6325| [45] [{Did you really not get out of LABO...?}]
414: 6330| [45] [But that telepathy garnered no response from Watase.]
415: 6335| [47] [Commander]
416: 6338| [45] ["... Returning to base."]
417: 6402| [45] [Eventually the commander spoke and turned the rescue copter around.]
418: 6407| [45] [The helicopter headed outside the city and began to rapidly accelerate--...]
