  1:   61| [45] [--But as soon as they left the room...]
  2:   66| [45] [Watase smelled something.]
  3:   74| [47] [Watase]
  4:   77| [45] ["Hmm?"]
  5:   82| [45] [The stench of something burning was filling the hallway from somewhere.]
  6:   90| [47] [Watase]
  7:   93| [45] ["Is it just me, or is something burning?"]
  8:  155| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  158| [45] ["You're right... Where in the world is it coming from...?"]
 10:  163| [45] [The group carefully followed the stench to its origin.]
 11:  168| [45] [They then arrived at a stairwell--]
 12:  220| [45] [--only to find it full of thin smoke.]
 13:  225| [45] [They looked towards the bottom of the stairs and spotted a tiny fire flickering behind the staircase.]
 14:  258| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  261| [45] ["It doesn't appear all that strong..."]
 16:  278| [47] [Watase]
 17:  281| [45] ["Hey old man, it's dangerous, so stay back and wait."]
 18:  360| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  363| [45] ["All right."]
 20:  377| [45] [Once he confirmed Ukita was now outside the stairwell, Watase descended the staircase with Kazami.]
 21:  427| [45] [They then checked out the small fire.]
 22:  435| [47] [Watase]
 23:  438| [45] ["Was the fire not fully put out and it just relit?"]
 24:  464| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  467| [45] ["It appears that the sprinklers weren't able to put it out entirely because it was in the shadow of the staircase."]
 26:  481| [45] [The fire was of fairly small scale. Putting it out would probably be a piece of cake.]
 27:  486| [45] [Watase determined that and immediately started giving out orders.]
 28:  494| [47] [Watase]
 29:  497| [45] ["Anyway, prep me a fire hose."]
 30:  523| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  526| [45] ["Yes!"]
 32:  546| [45] [Kazami obeyed Watase's orders and ran off into B2.]
 33:  556| [45] [The fire was of fairly small scale. Putting it out looked like it'd be a piece of cake, but--]
 34:  564| [47] [Watase]
 35:  567| [45] ["What should we do, Tachibana?"]
 36:  593| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  596| [45] ["Put the fire out, of course."]
 38:  622| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  625| [45] ["I'll go get a fire hose now. You wait there on standby."]
 40:  645| [45] [Kazami then ran off into B2.]
 41:  696| [45] [But as soon as she'd left-- Watase noticed a fire extinguisher sitting next to the fire.]
 42:  740| [47] [Watase]
 43:  741| [45] [(... A fire extinguisher?)]
 44:  746| [45] [It wasn't odd for there to be a fire extinguisher in a stairwell.]
 45:  751| [45] [It looked like the fire nearby was almost trying to crawl over to the extinguisher.]
 46:  833| [45] [Watase felt shivers run down his spine for some reason when he saw that.]
 47:  838| [47] [Watase]
 48:  839| [45] [(What is it!?)]
 49:  857| [45] [He heard footsteps at the same time. Kazami had returned.]
 50:  891| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  894| [45] ["Captain, I've got the hos--"]
 52:  899| [45] [Watase started shouting right then.]
 53:  913| [47] [Watase]
 54:  916| [45] ["Tachibana, stay back! Retreat!"]
 55:  943| [47] [Kazami]
 56:  946| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 57:  951| [45] [Kazami froze where she stood.]
 58:  956| [45] [Warning alarms were ringing in Watase's head.]
 59:  964| [47] [Watase]
 60:  967| [45] ["Look out!"]
 61: 1022| [45] [Watase lunged for Kazami as he shouted that.]
 62: 1027| [45] [And right after he dove out of the stairwell with her--]
 63: 1032| [45] [There was a brilliant flash behind him.]
