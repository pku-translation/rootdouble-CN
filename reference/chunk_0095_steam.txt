  1:  137| [45] [Watase and Kazami carried Natsuhiko and Salyu (respectively) towards Area 4.]
  2:  142| [45] [All the emergency staircases in Area 5 were out of commission, so they decided to get to the infirmary through Area 4.]
  3:  205| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  208| [45] ["... Captain, be careful on the way there."]
  5:  216| [47] [Watase]
  6:  219| [45] ["Why, did something happen?"]
  7:  245| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  248| [45] ["Actually, Moribe and Mr. Ukita ran out of the surveillance room before I went to Area N--"]
  9:  274| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  277| [45] ["The two of them do not seem to be in their right minds."]
 11:  285| [47] [Watase]
 12:  288| [45] ["Not in their right minds...?"]
 13:  314| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  317| [45] ["I am not sure how to explain it... but at any rate, it would be dangerous for you to come across either of them."]
 15:  322| [45] [He didn't know the details, but the tone in Kazami's voice and the look on her face were enough to convince Watase.]
 16:  330| [47] [Watase]
 17:  333| [45] ["... All right. Then I'll be on my guard from now on."]
 18:  338| [45] [Watase and Kazami carefully made their way down the connecting passageway.]
 19:  429| [45] [Fortunately, they made it to the infirmary without encountering anyone else.]
 20:  479| [45] [They then laid the children down on the beds and began treating Natsuhiko immediately.]
 21:  484| [45] [Kazami used the scanner there to check Natsuhiko's bloodtype.]
 22:  510| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  513| [45] ["... Got it. Type O, Rh positive. No acute reactions."]
 24:  518| [45] [She then took the Type O blood pack out of the refrigerator and quickly set it into the transfusion kit.]
 25:  523| [45] [Finally, she pricked Natsuhiko with the needle, starting the transfusion.]
 26:  528| [45] [While all that was going on, Watase used all the Chiron he had on hand to seal up Natsuhiko's wounds as much as possible.]
 27:  536| [47] [Watase]
 28:  539| [45] ["... How's his condition? Think he can pull through?"]
 29:  565| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  568| [45] ["His respiration and pulse are extremely feeble. But his vital signs are just barely stable--"]
 31:  594| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  597| [45] ["I can't make any guesses as to how it'll turn out in the end, but I think he'll just pull through if we keep the transfusion going."]
 33:  602| [45] [Immense relief washed over Watase.]
 34:  610| [47] [Watase]
 35:  613| [45] ["Thank God..."]
 36:  639| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  642| [45] ["But this is still strictly first-aid treatment. I believe we should get him to a hospital as soon as possible."]
 38:  668| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  671| [45] ["But before we get into that, please tell me something. What in the world happened after you left the surveillance room?"]
 40:  679| [47] [Watase]
 41:  682| [45] ["You see..."]
 42:  687| [45] [Kazami stared at Watase with a stern look on her face as the latter recounted the series of events that'd lead him to this point.]
 43:  692| [45] [He started by telling her about how he'd gone to Area N all by himself to try to put out the fires in order to end the lockdown.]
 44:  697| [45] [He then talked about how there had been no fires there, to say the least of a melted down nuclear reactor.]
 45:  702| [45] [Finally, he mentioned how he found Natsuhiko, was attacked by Salyu right afterwards, and then reluctantly knocked her unconscious.]
 46:  728| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  731| [45] ["So that's what happened..."]
 48:  736| [45] [Kazami lowered her eyes to the floor as she pondered what Watase had told her.]
 49:  762| [47] [Kazami]
 50:  765| [45] ["... There are just so many unanswered questions this raises that I admit I'm having trouble figuring out where to start, but..."]
 51:  791| [47] [Kazami]
 52:  794| [45] ["First of all..."]
 53:  802| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  805| [45] ["What do you think about LABO, Captain?"]
 55:  813| [47] [Watase]
 56:  816| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 57:  842| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  845| [45] ["There was no nuclear reactor or fire in Area N. Yet the lockdown is still going on..."]
 59:  871| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  874| [45] ["Is there any reason you can think of as to why that is?"]
 61:  882| [47] [Watase]
 62:  885| [45] ["Mmm... honestly, I have no clue..."]
 63:  893| [47] [Watase]
 64:  896| [45] ["But I'm convinced now that the fact there's no nuclear reactor here means that this place isn't even a nuclear research facility to begin with..."]
 65:  922| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  925| [45] ["I agree."]
 67:  951| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  954| [45] ["But that raises another question: that means there's no radiation here..."]
 69:  980| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  983| [45] ["Yet we still got numb skin and headaches when we didn't take any AD."]
 71:  991| [47] [Watase]
 72:  994| [45] ["Yeah. What's more, I still got headaches, vomited, and even passed out when I went into contaminated zones."]
 73: 1002| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1005| [45] ["... So that means there's still something dangerous contaminating this place."]
 75: 1031| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1034| [45] ["Then if that machine in Area N wasn't a nuclear reactor... what in the world was it?"]
 77: 1039| [45] [Just as Kazami said that-- a fragmented memory flashed through Watase's brain.]
 78: 1047| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1050| [45] ["...?"]
 80: 1058| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1061| [45] ["Wait a minute... I think I've seen that machine somewhere before...!"]
 82: 1087| [47] [Kazami]
 83: 1090| [45] ["What? Was it before you lost your memories?"]
 84: 1098| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1101| [45] ["No... it was more recently. Just a few hours ago."]
 86: 1109| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1112| [45] ["I'm pretty sure it was--"]
 88: 1117| [45] [But before Watase could remember,]
 89: 1221| [45] [the door to the infirmary suddenly opened.]
