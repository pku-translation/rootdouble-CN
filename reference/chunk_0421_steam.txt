  2:   68| [45] [--Those events became the past in an instant, and new days continued on afterwards.]
  3:   75| [45] [And now we have finally reached "today"--]
  4:   80| [45] [It's September 19, 2031, exactly one year after that incident.]
  5:  141| [45] [It's the first time in a while...]
  6:  146| [45] [That -I- have visited Rokumei City.]

  8:  189| [47] [[--Watase Kasasagi's Present--]]
  9:  273| [45] [... A gentle breeze sways through the trees.]
 10:  278| [45] [I slowly walk down the road as I feel that wind caress my cheeks.]
 11:  283| [45] [In my left hand is a bouquet.]
 12:  288| [45] [And in my right-- is the hand of the woman I love more than anything.]
 13:  315| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  318| [45] ["The weather's so nice, isn't it...?"]
 15:  326| [47] [Watase]
 16:  329| [45] ["Yeah, it's really calm and peaceful... The air never tasted this good in prison."]
 17:  334| [45] [I'm relishing in the freedom I've finally obtained from the bottom of my heart.]
 18:  339| [45] [I'm finally walking-- not under confinement, nor under someone else's control, but on my own two feet.]
 19:  344| [45] [I never thought I could be so grateful for something we all take for granted.]
 20:  352| [47] [Watase]
 21:  355| [45] ["I'll have to thank Teach for making sure I got released in time for today."]
 22:  382| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  385| [45] ["That's true..."]
 24:  390| [45] [Kazami casts her eyes downard.]
 25:  395| [45] [Her face from the side still looks as beautiful as ever.]
 26:  403| [47] [Watase]
 27:  406| [45] ["... I know I just got out of prison, but I'm sorry for being so busy."]
 28:  414| [47] [Watase]
 29:  417| [45] ["A year's gone by and yet I still have lots to do."]
 30:  444| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  447| [45] ["No, don't be sorry... I don't mind."]
 32:  474| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  477| [45] ["I'm just happy that you're alive... and that you can live by my side."]
 34:  485| [47] [Watase]
 35:  488| [45] ["Kazami..."]
 36:  493| [45] [Kazami and I look at each other.]
 37:  498| [45] [But-- right then, we hear a voice calling out to us from far up ahead.]
 38:  562| [47] [Jun]
 39:  565| [45] ["Geez, get a room, you guys!"]
 40:  571| [45] [I look to find Jun staring at us.]
 41:  577| [45] [I look to find Jun staring at us.]
 42:  652| [45] [She's wearing the same orange uniform.]
 43:  657| [45] [Though Kazami and I have resigned, Jun's still in Sirius.]
 44:  715| [47] [Jun]
 45:  718| [45] ["Hurry up or my lunch break's gonna end, you hear!? I'm not supposed to be here, so rapido!"]
 46:  726| [47] [Watase]
 47:  729| [45] ["Whoa now, no need to rush. Not today of all days."]
 48:  762| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  765| [45] ["I see you're as cheerful as always."]
 50:  791| [47] [Jun]
 51:  794| [45] ["What're you on about? It's -because- it's today that I wanna act cheerful."]
 52:  799| [45] [Our eyes widen at those words.]
 53:  825| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  828| [45] ["... That's true..."]
 55:  836| [47] [Watase]
 56:  839| [45] ["Then I guess it's about time we go see her, don't you think?"]
 57:  865| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  868| [45] ["Yes."]
 59:  894| [47] [Jun]
 60:  897| [45] ["Yeah."]
 61:  902| [45] [We resume walking at those words.]
 62:  907| [45] [Our destination-- Rokumei Cemetery, located on the other side of the woods in the park.]
 63:  975| [45] [--Today's the anniversary of Nagisa's death.]
 64:  980| [45] [We overcame many obstacles just so we could visit her grave.]
 65:  985| [45] [And when we make our way to the Tachibana family grave, Nagisa's resting place--]
 66: 1039| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1042| [45] ["Oh!"]
 68: 1047| [45] [We find two familiar faces.]
 69: 1075| [47] [Ena]
 70: 1078| [45] ["Oh my, someone's late."]
 71: 1104| [47] [Ukita]
 72: 1107| [45] ["Oh, haven't seen you people in ages."]
 73: 1112| [45] [It's Teach and old man Ukita.]
 74: 1117| [45] [It looks like they got here before us and offered sticks of incense at Nagisa's grave.]
 75: 1143| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1146| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita! You came here too!?"]
 77: 1172| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1175| [45] ["I apologize if we made you feel obliged to stop by at such a busy time..."]
 79: 1201| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1204| [45] ["Don't worry, this is far more important than anything on my plate right now."]
 81: 1230| [47] [Ukita]
 82: 1233| [45] ["That's right... and this marks my first full year of atonement."]
 83: 1238| [45] [Teach and the old man smile as they say that.]
 84: 1252| [45] [We return their smiles, then offer flowers to Nagisa's grave.]
 85: 1283| [47] [Jun]
 86: 1286| [45] ["... But man, it's been ages since I've seen you guys~ What've you been up to?"]
 87: 1312| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1315| [45] ["I reached out to Dr. Tenkawa after I was released from prison. We're currently gathering sympathizers to help us plan out the development of an ethically moral BC research facility."]
 89: 1341| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1344| [45] ["Like the PRC back in its days of yore."]
 91: 1370| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1373| [45] ["I've been going back and forth to six different government designated top-secret cities. Man, I'm so busy I feel like I'm gonna die."]
 93: 1399| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1402| [45] ["So similar problems really are going on in the other top-secret cities, aren't they?"]
 95: 1428| [47] [Ena]
 96: 1431| [45] ["Not as bad as Rokumei City, but yeah. They more or less all have skeletons in their closets."]
 97: 1439| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1442| [45] ["... There's also the matter of Q too, isn't there?"]
 99: 1468| [47] [Jun]
100: 1471| [45] ["It may look peaceful, but this country sure is full of problems, huh..."]
101: 1476| [45] [Ena replied with a sigh in her voice.]
102: 1502| [47] [Ena]
103: 1505| [45] ["... It takes a huge incident like this one to wake people up before they notice these problems, huh."]
104: 1513| [47] [Ena]
105: 1516| [45] ["Even if they sense there's a problem, they never go looking for it..."]
106: 1524| [47] [Ena]
107: 1527| [45] ["And as society gets more complex, so too do its problems."]
108: 1535| [47] [Ena]
109: 1538| [45] ["And when more people get involved, their own individual circumstances and definitions of justice get tangled up, and eventually it becomes difficult to tell who's in the wrong."]
110: 1543| [45] [--Perhaps there really is some truth to that.]
111: 1597| [45] [It was the same with LABO.]
112: 1602| [45] [Whose fault was it that caused that insane incident-- the people running LABO, or Rokumei's city officials?]
113: 1607| [45] [Was it the fault of that pharmaceutical company that was business partners with LABO?]
114: 1657| [45] [Was it the fault of those two researchers who died underground, or the many other Senior Fellows who turned a blind eye?]
115: 1709| [45] [If you go further back, you could say it was caused by Alice Enflamme, her parents, or the people who persecuted Alice.]
116: 1714| [45] [Perhaps "Eishi Azumi", the man who developed Alice's BC abilities, or "Section Chief Tsubakiyama", Teach's father who suggested the establishment of LABO, were also factors.]
117: 1766| [45] [The more people involved, the harder it gets to pin one of them as fully responsible.]
118: 1771| [45] [The malice of individuals may seem utterly trivial.]
119: 1776| [45] [But when one's malice spreads to others, it amplifies, then stagnates and decays.]
120: 1781| [45] [Sometimes it decays enough for the people in on the whole problem to not even notice it...]
121: 1838| [47] [Jun]
122: 1841| [45] ["... But still, if there are problems, someone's gotta fix them, right?"]
123: 1867| [47] [Ukita]
124: 1870| [45] ["Indeed. But even if you know of a problem, it is difficult to build the courage to correct it."]
125: 1878| [47] [Watase]
126: 1881| [45] ["And sometimes, even those with that courage go about correcting the problems in decisively illegal ways."]
127: 1904| [45] [The old man and I exchange wry smiles.]
128: 1909| [45] [Kazami mutters sadly.]
129: 1935| [47] [Kazami]
130: 1938| [45] ["... If it takes the loss of others for people to finally realize that..."]
131: 1946| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1949| [45] ["Then will we be forced to keep losing all sorts of things in the future?"]
133: 1972| [47] [Watase]
134: 1973| [45] ["..."]
135: 1999| [47] [Kazami]
136: 2002| [45] ["If so, then does that mean... Nagisa's death was an inevitable part of that process?"]
137: 2010| [47] [Watase]
138: 2013| [45] ["No chance in hell."]
139: 2018| [45] [I instantly answer Kazami's question.]
140: 2026| [47] [Watase]
141: 2029| [45] ["We must never assume it's 'inevitable' for there to be victims... Never."]
142: 2037| [47] [Watase]
143: 2040| [45] ["There are those who can't be forgiven. Every problem in this world has its own root cause. That's a fact."]
144: 2048| [47] [Watase]
145: 2051| [45] ["If many people are involved, then they should all take responsibility."]
146: 2077| [47] [Ena]
147: 2080| [45] ["Oh my, you're sounding rather full of yourself there."]
148: 2106| [47] [Jun]
149: 2109| [45] ["You've got no right to talk, Mr. Ex-Terrorist~"]
150: 2117| [47] [Watase]
151: 2120| [45] ["Yeah, I was a terrorist-- the worst son of a bitch there was. If you just look at the incident last year by itself, then I deserve more blame for it than anyone else."]
152: 2128| [47] [Watase]
153: 2131| [45] ["Property damage, assembling with dangerous weapons, assault, violating the Swords and Firearms Control Law-- all of that and more is on me. It's a miracle a scoundrel like me got released in just a year."]
154: 2139| [47] [Watase]
155: 2142| [45] ["... But I've atoned for my sins."]
156: 2150| [47] [Watase]
157: 2153| [45] ["So I figured that now that I'm out of prison, I'll work to make this world a better place. This time without taking up arms."]
158: 2161| [47] [Watase]
159: 2164| [45] ["I'm in no position to face the world... but at the very least, my intentions are true."]
160: 2169| [45] [After I finish giving that rather self-indulgent speech, I expect to find everyone staring at me oddly, but--]
161: 2195| [47] [Kazami]
162: 2198| [45] ["... Well, that's just the kind of person you always were..."]
163: 2224| [47] [Jun]
164: 2227| [45] ["Well, you -have- gotten the resolve to bear those sins, right?"]
165: 2253| [47] [Ena]
166: 2256| [45] ["Besides, without the opportunity to start things over, there would be nobody left to take responsibility."]
167: 2282| [47] [Ukita]
168: 2285| [45] ["... I have no right to be saying anything, but I agree with you for now, Captain Kasasagi."]
169: 2290| [45] [The four of them accept me with wry smiles.]
170: 2295| [45] [I mentally breathe a sigh of relief. Kazami then speaks up.]
171: 2321| [47] [Kazami]
172: 2324| [45] ["But that aside... I hope others can change just like you have."]
173: 2332| [47] [Kazami]
174: 2335| [45] ["If they don't, then Nagisa and the others will truly never rest in peace."]
175: 2361| [47] [Jun]
176: 2364| [45] ["... Sis... I'm sure they can change this time."]
177: 2372| [47] [Jun]
178: 2375| [45] ["When you look back on history, things like this have happened over and over again."]
179: 2401| [47] [Jun]
180: 2404| [45] ["Like with the Chernobyl power plant disaster or the incident at LABO last year. Both may have been dark chapters in history..."]
181: 2430| [47] [Jun]
182: 2433| [45] ["But each time, people learn, people regret... and people reconsider their actions little by little. That's what I believe."]
183: 2438| [45] [Teach suddenly speaks up when she hears that.]
184: 2465| [47] [Ena]
185: 2468| [45] ["--You're talking about 'Before Crime * After Days', aren't you?"]
186: 2476| [47] [Watase]
187: 2479| [45] ["Huh?"]
188: 2505| [47] [Ena]
189: 2508| [45] ["You've never heard of it? It's a proposal this sociologist made about the phenomenon of drastic transitions in society."]
190: 2516| [47] [Ena]
191: 2519| [45] ["It refers to when there's a sudden change in society's value systems when you compare them before a 'crime' is exposed and in the days after."]
192: 2545| [47] [Ena]
193: 2548| [45] ["That's exactly how it is in this case. Society changes after something once thought 'normal' becomes deemed as 'strange' and 'criminal'."]
194: 2574| [47] [Ena]
195: 2577| [45] ["We have to fix what's wrong and we have to change ourselves too."]
196: 2585| [47] [Ena]
197: 2588| [45] ["If we don't, then our society will just get crazier and crazier... That's what almost everyone thinks."]
198: 2596| [47] [Watase]
199: 2599| [45] ["I see..."]
200: 2744| [45] [That's certainly the case with me personally.]
201: 2749| [45] [I changed greatly "before committing that crime" and in "the days after".]
202: 2754| [45] [I don't mean to advocate crime at all, but I definitely thought that things needed to change.]
203: 2759| [45] [Both in this world and in myself...]
204: 2767| [47] [Watase]
205: 2770| [45] ["... We've been able to live 'in the days after' we came face to face with that major incident."]
206: 2778| [47] [Watase]
207: 2781| [45] ["So we mustn't waste those days."]
208: 2804| [45] [I look at Kazami after I say that.]
209: 2812| [47] [Watase]
210: 2815| [45] ["Hey, Kazami. I swear I'll make this society as good of a place as I can."]
211: 2823| [47] [Watase]
212: 2826| [45] ["If we can change, then our surroundings should be able to change little by little too."]
213: 2831| [45] [No-- they have to change.]
214: 2836| [45] [Even if that's a naive ideal of mine, I can't do anything unless I believe that.]
215: 2841| [45] [My true atonement is to devote the rest of my life to ensure that change.]
216: 2864| [45] [Kazami then finally smiles as if she can tell what I'm thinking.]
217: 2872| [47] [Kazami]
218: 2875| [45] ["... That's right."]
219: 2901| [47] [Kazami]
220: 2904| [45] ["Malice may spread from person to person..."]
221: 2930| [47] [Kazami]
222: 2933| [45] ["But that's because good will does as well."]
223: 2941| [47] [Watase]
224: 2944| [45] ["Yeah, exactly."]
225: 2949| [45] [A thought crosses my mind when I hear that.]
226: 2982| [45] [Indeed-- when people come in contact, they definitely have some sort of mutual effect on each other.]
227: 2987| [45] [They then respond to that change, and their relationship starts to change too.]
228: 2992| [45] [If there is good will and the will to understand one another in there, then their relationship will surely turn out good.]
229: 2997| [45] [Much like how our relationships changed greatly in those nine hours.]
230: 3002| [45] [When I think about that, I suddenly start to wonder how "he" is doing.]
231: 3010| [47] [Watase]
232: 3013| [45] ["Hey, Teach... about the brat..."]
233: 3039| [47] [Ena]
234: 3042| [45] ["Hmm?"]
235: 3050| [47] [Watase]
236: 3053| [45] ["Is he doing well? You would know, wouldn't you?"]
237: 3079| [47] [Ena]
238: 3082| [45] ["Oh my, are you actually worried about him?"]
239: 3090| [47] [Watase]
240: 3093| [45] ["Well, a little..."]
241: 3119| [47] [Jun]
242: 3122| [45] ["Oh brother, you sure ain't honest."]
243: 3148| [47] [Ukita]
244: 3151| [45] ["Well, this is just what things are like between two men."]
245: 3177| [47] [Kazami]
246: 3180| [45] ["I thought you'd become a bit calmer recently, but I guess that part of you hasn't changed a bit, has it?"]
247: 3185| [45] [I break out into a wry smile from Kazami and the others' comments.]
248: 3248| [45] [I then look to the skies and think.]
249: 3253| [45] [--Of course I'm worried. How could I not be? We nearly fought to the death once.]
250: 3258| [45] [That's why I offer a silent prayer for his sake.]
251: 3263| [45] [I pray that he's living his life peacefully in those "days after".]
252: 3456| [45] [--Everyone here surely feels the same way.]
253: 3461| [45] [They all must be praying for peaceful days for the partners they fought side-by-side with on that fateful day.]
254: 3519| [45] [... And, around that time...]
