  0:   67| [45] [--September 16, 2030.]
  1:   72| [45] [When Yuuri learned that Natsuhiko had come to LABO, she quickly began manipulating his memories.]
  2:   77| [45] [So that he'd be ready to accept the truth.]
  3:   82| [45] [And to guide him gradually towards complete mental preparation.]
  4:  153| [45] [There were countless things she needed to do.]
  5:  158| [45] [First, she had to make Natsuhiko aware of his own growth.]
  6:  163| [45] [Next, she had to strengthen how he felt about his bonds with other people around him.]
  7:  168| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  169| [45] [(In Hikorin's mind, time stopped nine years ago.)]
  9:  174| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  175| [45] [(I've gotta get it moving again...)]
 11:  222| [45] [Natsuhiko's memories seemed to be slightly warped by the actions of his own brain.]
 12:  227| [45] [Even Yuuri could clearly see that his impressions of Mashiro and Salyu were far worse than what they actually should be.]
 13:  232| [45] [Which was likely the result of how he had closed his heart to others for many years.]
 14:  237| [45] [But if he kept that up, he would have no chance of handling the impending truth.]
 15:  397| [45] [And to that end, Yuuri worked to mend Natsuhiko's impressions of the ones who supported him--]
 16:  452| [45] [--Mashiro and Salyu in particular-- to more fitting, favorable impressions.]
 17:  457| [45] [Yuuri took extreme care to ensure that her modifications would seamlessly blend with reality.]
 18:  523| [45] [Meanwhile, Yuuri also dropped some hints to the truth one by one.]
 19:  528| [45] [She hinted that soon enough, his false peace would end and he would have to part with the phantom.]
 20:  533| [45] [Natsuhiko was perplexed at first, but eventually, he gained the strength to face the past.]
 21:  644| [45] [--And as he overcame several crises,]
 22:  697| [45] [he was able to keep moving forward, even in LABO,]
 23:  852| [45] [because Mashiro and Salyu were there for him.]
 24:  910| [47] [Automatic PA]
 25:  913| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
 26:  918| [47] [Automatic PA]
 27:  921| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
 28:  926| [47] [Automatic PA]
 29:  929| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
 30:  940| [45] [Even when he encountered a Case N announcement in Area 5, he did not despair.]
 31:  985| [45] [As she saw the results of Natsuhiko's progression, Yuuri thought to herself.]
 32:  990| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  991| [45] [(With this... Hikorin might be able to accept the truth.)]
 34:  996| [45] [Natsuhiko's headache was gone as suddenly as it had come.]
 35: 1001| [45] [His mental preparation was almost complete.]
 36: 1060| [47] [Yuuri]
 37: 1061| [45] [(All that's left is the finishing touch.)]
 38: 1066| [45] [The finishing touch-- make Natsuhiko realize the fact that Mashiro had been supporting him all these nine years.]
 39: 1071| [45] [If he only knew, he'd be thankful for Mashiro and would perhaps be able to cope with Yuuri's death.]
 40: 1180| [45] [--The problem was how to open the gate after it had locked down, but Yuuri happened to see that the professor's security card had been dropped in the stairwell.]
 41: 1185| [45] [Natsuhiko hadn't noticed it, so Yuuri tried to inform him of it, but--]
 42: 1237| [45] [--immediately after she did, there was an unforeseen turn of events.]
 43: 1286| [45] [Natsuhiko had gone to Dr. Miyoko Tenkawa's office and found something--]
 44: 1291| [45] [--a file of newspaper articles covering the incident nine years ago.]
 45: 1299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46: 1302| [45] ["H... huh...!?"]
 47: 1325| [45] [Natsuhiko's body trembled. He looked towards Yuuri in a daze.]
 48: 1348| [47] [Yuuri]
 49: 1349| [45] [(Ah... oh no! It's still a little too early!)]
 50: 1374| [47] [Yuuri]
 51: 1375| [45] [(But now that it's come to this, there's nothing I can do but gamble on Hikorin's mental strength...!)]
 52: 1380| [45] [Yuuri prepared herself and sent telepathy to Natsuhiko.]
 53: 1640| [47] [Yuuri]
 54: 1643| [45] ["Now you understand why I said I couldn't go with you, don't you...?"]
 55: 1648| [45] [It was a conclusive statement heralding the end of a long dream.]
 56: 1656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1659| [45] ["... No..."]
 58: 1664| [45] [Natsuhiko's innermost thoughts propagated to Yuuri as well.]
 59: 1669| [45] [His confusion, sorrow, agitation, fear-- and despair.]
 60: 1674| [45] [But even so, Yuuri continued.]
 61: 1722| [47] [Yuuri]
 62: 1725| [45] ["... Hikorin, it's time to say goodbye."]
 63: 1730| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1731| [45] ["--"]
 65: 1739| [47] [Yuuri]
 66: 1742| [45] ["... I'm sorry for deceiving you for so long."]
 67: 1750| [47] [Yuuri]
 68: 1753| [45] ["I wanted to support you..."]
 69: 1761| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1764| [45] ["... But I'm sure you'll be okay without me now."]
 71: 1772| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1775| [45] ["You've noticed it these past few days, haven't you? You're not alone, Hikorin."]
 73: 1780| [45] [--Yuuri spoke sincerely. To move Natsuhiko's heart.]
 74: 1785| [45] [But her voice didn't get through to him.]
 75: 1970| [45] [For when Yuuri ceased the telepathy transmission and erased the phantom--]
 76: 1978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1981| [45] ["... Ugh, aah...."]
 78: 1986| [45] [--Natsuhiko groaned faintly--]
 79: 1994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1997| [45] ["--AaaaaAAAAAGGHH!!"]
 81: 2002| [45] [--and screamed madly.]
 82: 2106| [47] [Yuuri]
 83: 2107| [45] [(N-no way...! That still wasn't enough!?)]
 84: 2112| [45] [Yuuri fell into despair once more.]
 85: 2117| [45] [She had no idea that the curse of hers that bound him was that strong--!]
 86: 2128| [45] [And then, the door opened and Mashiro rushed in.]
 87: 2161| [47] [Mashiro]
 88: 2164| [45] ["Natsuhiko!?"]
 89: 2190| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 2193| [45] ["Natsuhiko, I heard a scream. What happened!?"]
 91: 2201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 2204| [45] ["... Yuuri..."]
 93: 2212| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 2215| [45] ["... She disappeared..."]
 95: 2429| [45] [--Natsuhiko flared up at Mashiro.]
 96: 2434| [45] [As if to spew out the sorrow of losing Yuuri and the bitterness of having been lied to for nine whole years.]
 97: 2442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 2445| [45] ["Yuuri's gone, isn't she!? She's been gone for nine goddamn years!"]
 99: 2493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 2496| [45] ["And you just played along with my madness, didn't you!? Is this your idea of a joke!?"]
101: 2504| [47] [Mashiro]
102: 2507| [45] ["N-no way...!"]
103: 2512| [45] [Both Natsuhiko and Mashiro's eyes welled up with tears.]
104: 2517| [45] [And as she observed the situation through Natsuhiko's eyes-- Yuuri too was saddened.]
105: 2522| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 2523| [45] [(No, Hikorin...! You mustn't hold it against Mashiron...!)]
107: 2528| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 2529| [45] [(She's been there supporting you all this time...!)]
109: 2534| [45] [Yuuri was rife with regret.]
110: 2539| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 2540| [45] [(What should I have done...?)]
112: 2545| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 2546| [45] [(What should I do for Hikorin--)]
114: 2551| [45] [But before Yuuri could think any further--]
115: 2558| [45] [--the unexpected happened.]
116: 2709| [45] [Suddenly, Natsuhiko's vision was engulfed in darkness.]
117: 2715| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 2716| [45] [(!?)]
119: 2721| [45] [His consciousness was abruptly thrown into that endless darkness.]
120: 2729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2732| [45] [{Huh... Wh-what is this...!?}]
122: 2737| [45] [Natsuhiko was astonished. But Yuuri understood what was happening.]
123: 2742| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2743| [45] [(No way...!)]
125: 2748| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 2749| [45] [(Hikorin's sympathized with Mashiron's mind!?)]
127: 2853| [45] [The third ability-- "Senses Sympathy" had awoken within Natsuhiko.]
128: 2858| [45] [Though he had shown signs of it the previous night, it was still an unexpected, but welcome surprise.]
129: 2863| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 2864| [45] [(Th... that's it!)]
131: 2869| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 2870| [45] [(Now Hikorin should be able to understand Mashiron's feelings...!)]
133: 2875| [45] [Natsuhiko peered into Mashiro's memories, bewildered at what was going on.]
134: 2923| [45] [And thus-- Natsuhiko learned the truth that Mashiro had been caring for him all these nine years.]
135: 3096| [45] [--When he returned to reality, Natsuhiko tearfully apologized to Mashiro.]
136: 3104| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 3107| [45] ["Mashiro...!"]
138: 3115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 3118| [45] ["I'm sorry...! I'm so sorry...!"]
140: 3165| [47] [Mashiro]
141: 3168| [45] ["Huh...?"]
142: 3176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 3179| [45] ["You've always been there to support me, haven't you..."]
144: 3187| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 3190| [45] ["You've always been there for me, right by my side...!"]
146: 3236| [45] [As she listened in on their conversation, Yuuri thought to herself.]
147: 3283| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 3284| [45] [(Thank goodness...)]
149: 3289| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 3290| [45] [(Now Hikorin and Mashiron... are both truly free from my curse.)]
151: 3295| [45] [And now her role was complete.]
152: 3300| [45] [With that feeling of closure--]
153: 3307| [45] [Yuuri calmly disconnected from Natsuhiko's mind.]
154: 3417| [45] [--Her own senses returned to her as soon as she did.]
155: 3422| [45] [What spread out before her eyes was an empty room.]
156: 3427| [45] [But the sight of the lonely room began to blur.]
157: 3435| [47] [Yuuri]
158: 3438| [45] ["Huh... why am I...?"]
159: 3443| [45] [Yuuri realized that she was crying.]
160: 3448| [45] [Natsuhiko was free from Yuuri's curse. Free to be with Mashiro.]
161: 3453| [45] [She thought that was what she had always wished for, and yet--]
162: 3458| [45] [Yuuri felt as if her heart had been torn in two.]
163: 3463| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 3464| [45] ["..."]
165: 3472| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 3475| [45] ["No... this is for the best...!"]
167: 3484| [45] [With that belief, Yuuri wiped her tears.]
168: 3489| [45] [--Just then...]
169: 3516| [45] [She heard a knock on the shelter door.]
170: 3524| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 3527| [45] ["Ah... Professor?"]
172: 3548| [45] [Yuuri was taken aback and rushed over to the door.]
173: 3553| [45] [If the professor had returned, then Yuuri wanted her shoulder to cry on.]
174: 3558| [45] [She was the only one who understood Yuuri. The only one who shared her sadness.%NSomeone she could truly call "Mom".]
175: 3565| [45] [But when she opened the door--]
176: 3641| [45] [--she found not the professor, but an unfamiliar man standing there.]
177: 3664| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 3667| [45] ["...!?"]
179: 3675| [47] [Watase]
180: 3678| [45] ["Finally found you... You're a person of interest to this lab, right?"]
181: 3686| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 3689| [45] ["Who... who are you?"]
183: 3697| [47] [Watase]
184: 3700| [45] ["I'm a rescue worker. I'm here to save you guys."]
185: 3705| [45] [His voice sounded familiar. It sent shivers of anxiety down her spine.]
186: 3710| [47] [Yuuri]
187: 3711| [45] [(Where have I heard that voice...!?)]
188: 3716| [45] [She soon remembered.]
189: 3770| [45] [She'd heard that voice in Natsuhiko's memory-- He was one of the terrorists!]
190: 3778| [47] [Yuuri]
191: 3781| [45] ["You're... with Q!?"]
192: 3849| [47] [Watase]
193: 3852| [45] ["!!"]
194: 3857| [45] [The man unintentionally gasped. For a moment, his face froze over.]
195: 3862| [45] [But that face soon warped into a wicked expression.]
196: 3888| [47] [Watase]
197: 3891| [45] ["Hey... did you cheat and use BC? To read my mind?"]
198: 3896| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 3897| [45] ["..."]
200: 3923| [47] [Watase]
201: 3926| [45] ["Well, whatever. You're coming with me."]
202: 3956| [45] [And with that, the man grabbed Yuuri by the arm.]
203: 3979| [47] [Yuuri]
204: 3982| [45] ["N-no! Stop it!"]
205: 4008| [47] [Watase]
206: 4011| [45] ["Please don't struggle! I won't have to get violent as long as you behave!"]
207: 4016| [45] [It was very hard to take the man's words at face value.]
208: 4021| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 4022| [45] [(Then I'll just have to erase his--!)]
210: 4027| [45] [Yuuri plotted to destroy the man's memory and run.]
211: 4053| [45] [But before she could-- a pain ran through her neck.]
212: 4061| [47] [Yuuri]
213: 4064| [45] ["Oww!"]
214: 4069| [45] [Though she didn't understand what just happened, Yuuri tried to use BC.]
215: 4074| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 4075| [45] [(... Huh?)]
217: 4080| [45] [But nothing happened.]
218: 4085| [45] [She couldn't destroy the man's memory-- She couldn't even use Senses Sympathy itself at all!]
219: 4093| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 4096| [45] ["Wh-why..."]
221: 4122| [47] [Watase]
222: 4125| [45] ["I injected you with a BC inhibitor. Your abilities won't work on me now."]
223: 4133| [47] [Yuuri]
224: 4136| [45] ["No way...!"]
225: 4141| [45] [Without BC, Yuuri was nothing but an ordinary, powerless girl.]
226: 4224| [45] [As Yuuri despaired, the man wrapped his arm around her neck.]
227: 4229| [45] [He applied pressure to her carotid artery.]
228: 4237| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 4240| [45] ["Ugh..."]
230: 4245| [45] [Yuuri tried to shake him off, but the man was too strong for her to even budge an inch.]
231: 4250| [45] [Suddenly, her sight blacked out.]
232: 4255| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 4256| [45] [(H... Hikorin... Mashiron...!)]
234: 4305| [45] [As Yuuri's consciousness faded away, she prayed.]
235: 4310| [45] [That the others would safely escape from here without encountering this man--]
