  0:   46| [55] [√Before Chapter 6]
  1:   62| [45] [--The kids explained the truth to the security department.]
  2:   67| [45] [The security department called an ambulance and took the man to Rokumei City Hospital.]
  3:   72| [45] [Fortunately, his wound wasn't as deep as they initially believed, and his treatment apparently went by relatively quickly.]
  4:   77| [45] [As for Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu, they were taken to the municipal office and underwent a long, thorough investigation.]
  5:   82| [45] [They explained everything in detail to the security department, starting with why they had sneaked into the PRC.]
  6:   87| [45] [It took a long time to get the security department to understand all the details, and they didn't seem easily swayed, but...]
  7:   92| [45] [Eventually, the security department members went to the hospital and interrogated the security guard, thus learning that he had falsified the report and that his abdominal injury was self-inflicted.]
  8:   97| [45] [They kids' methods earned them reproval for their recklessness, but their results earned them recognition for successfully apprehending an alleged terrorist in the end--]
  9:  102| [47] [Security Dept.]
 10:  105| [45] ["Thank you for your cooperation."]
 11:  110| [45] [And with a final stereotypical line from the security department members who had been chasing them for hours, the kids left the municipal office.]
 12:  153| [45] [--It was quite dark by the time they had gotten outside.]
 13:  214| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  217| [45] ["Tch, they could've at least given us a reward."]
 15:  222| [45] [Mashiro grumbled as they walked.]
 16:  227| [45] [She was quite on edge when the investigation began, but once she heard that the security guard was okay, she returned to her usual self.]
 17:  232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  233| [45] [(I don't know if she's being too greedy or being too soft...)]
 19:  238| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly as he made his reply.]
 20:  246| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  249| [45] ["Now, now, let's just be glad they didn't end up putting us in their custody, shall we?"]
 22:  275| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  278| [45] ["Well, I guess. Nothing's more valuable than freedom, I guess."]
 24:  305| [47] [Salyu]
 25:  308| [45] ["... You two are so unselfish."]
 26:  313| [45] [Salyu seemed unsatisfied, but Natsuhiko wasn't at all.]
 27:  318| [45] [Now that their names were cleared, they could move around without fear of the security department's shadow.]
 28:  323| [45] [And of course that meant they could return home.]
 29:  381| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  384| [45] ["Oh boy, we can finally rest easy... He may have been injured, but at least we caught the culprit."]
 31:  410| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  413| [45] ["They said the full-blown investigation will start once he's healed, right? I wish they'd pick up the pace, for goodness' sake."]
 33:  421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  424| [45] ["I know. But it's getting late today, so let's just go home and eat for now."]
 35:  450| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  453| [45] ["Yay. Food. We haven't eaten anything since breakfast."]
 37:  459| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled at how they were finally able to have a calm conversation for the first time that day.]
 38:  473| [55] [√Before Chapter 6]
 39:  480| [45] [But there was one regretful thing that happened.]
 40:  527| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  530| [45] ["... In the end, we couldn't stop the terrorists from blowing up the PRC like they wanted to..."]
 42:  538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  541| [45] ["Yeah... but at least there weren't any casualties."]
 44:  546| [45] [That was another thing they had heard from the security department.]
 45:  551| [45] [Thanks to Jun's team, all the PRC staff members were rescued successfully.]
 46:  556| [45] [But that was still nothing to be happy about.]
 47:  582| [47] [Mashiro]
 48:  585| [45] ["Actually, there's one more thing that bothers me..."]
 49:  593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  596| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 51:  604| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  607| [45] ["The security guard wasn't the man I saw on the bus."]
 53:  615| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  618| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
 55:  644| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  647| [45] ["So I guess there are still more of them in town..."]
 57:  652| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped at Mashiro's statement.]
 58:  678| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  681| [45] ["... I see. I have an idea about that point."]
 60:  689| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  692| [45] ["If you think about it calmly, the fact that the security guard stabbed himself in the stomach was also bizarre."]
 62:  700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  703| [45] ["Huh... What do you mean?"]
 64:  729| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  732| [45] ["While he did accomplish his mission to blow up the PRC, he had no need to commit suicide. The fact that his wound was superficial is also worrying."]
 66:  740| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  743| [45] ["The answer I can derive from these issues is that probably--"]
 68:  769| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  772| [45] ["His suicidal act was just that. An act. A performance to make it appear that all the incidents had reached a conclusive end."]
 70:  798| [47] [Mashiro]
 71:  801| [45] ["A performance!?"]
 72:  827| [47] [Salyu]
 73:  830| [45] ["If he went that far, anybody would believe that he was the one behind the entire string of incidents."]
 74:  838| [47] [Salyu]
 75:  841| [45] ["But what if was just an act to avert the public gaze away from other criminals?"]
 76:  867| [47] [Mashiro]
 77:  870| [45] ["Y-you mean..."]
 78:  878| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79:  881| [45] ["The incidents aren't over yet...!?"]
 80:  886| [45] [Everyone's faces stiffened at that statement.]
 81:  891| [45] [Natsuhiko stopped walking and interjected.]
 82:  899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83:  902| [45] ["... Hold on a second. Before we go back home, let's think things through a bit."]
 84:  910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85:  913| [45] ["If there are still terrorists around, what else do you think might happen here?"]
 86:  939| [47] [Mashiro]
 87:  942| [45] ["More terrorism, I guess? But what other targets are there...?"]
 88:  950| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89:  953| [45] ["The BC-related facilities that received the objectionable literature?"]
 90:  979| [47] [Salyu]
 91:  982| [45] ["But we heard that the security department was tightening their guard around those facilities."]
 92:  990| [47] [Salyu]
 93:  993| [45] ["And the objectionable literature was a diversion for the Parapsychology Research Center bombing in the first place. Targeting those addressees would defeat the purpose of the diversion."]
 94: 1001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1004| [45] ["Then what else could they be up to...?"]
 96: 1059| [45] [Natsuhiko got the feeling they were missing something important.]
 97: 1064| [45] [He thought about what that missing something could be.]
 98: 1069| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1070| [45] [(Arson? They wouldn't have had to make such an elaborate diversion to do that.)]
100: 1075| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1076| [45] [(I thought that all the diversions were to set up for the PRC bombing, but... was that not the case?)]
102: 1081| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1082| [45] [(Do they have a target besides the PRC...?)]
104: 1087| [45] [Natsuhiko's train of thought led him to that point before something flashed in the back of his mind.]
105: 1092| [45] [He then realized exactly what it was that they were missing.]
106: 1113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1116| [45] ["... Hey, Mashiro."]
108: 1142| [47] [Mashiro]
109: 1145| [45] ["Yeah?"]
110: 1153| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1156| [45] ["The man you saw on the bus mentioned 'ending this town's history', right?"]
112: 1182| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1185| [45] ["Huh? W-well, yeah, but..."]
114: 1193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1196| [45] ["But blowing up the PRC wouldn't end this town's history, would it...?"]
116: 1204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1207| [45] ["I mean, what if the PRC explosion itself were a diversion?"]
118: 1233| [47] [Mashiro]
119: 1236| [45] ["--!"]
120: 1241| [45] [Mashiro's face froze at the suggestion.]
121: 1267| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 1270| [45] ["H-hold on! You mean they're targeting a bigger facility than the PRC!?"]
123: 1278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1281| [45] ["Yeah, something that sorta symbolizes the city... Something they can destroy to satisfy their hatred against Communicators."]
125: 1307| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 1310| [45] ["But where would you find a facility like that? The PRC is the biggest BC research facility in town, isn't it?"]
127: 1336| [47] [Mashiro]
128: 1339| [45] ["You don't mean school, do you?"]
129: 1347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1350| [45] ["No, they already caused a panic at school with that bomb threat, so--"]
131: 1355| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko began to speak,]
132: 1381| [47] [Salyu]
133: 1384| [45] ["... If it were me,"]
134: 1389| [45] [Salyu finally broke her silence with a sighed utterance.]
135: 1415| [47] [Salyu]
136: 1418| [45] ["I'd target that place."]
137: 1423| [45] [Salyu pointed at the map posted at the bus stop.]
138: 1428| [45] [On the other side of her fingertip was an illustration--]
139: 1433| [45] [--of the hexagonal building, "LABO".]
140: 1459| [47] [Mashiro]
141: 1462| [45] ["Huh... LABO?"]
142: 1470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1473| [45] ["Salyu, that's not a BC-related facility. It's a nuclear research facility."]
144: 1499| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1502| [45] ["I know. But if I'm not mistaken--"]
146: 1511| [47] [Salyu]
147: 1514| [45] ["They should have a nuclear reactor."]
148: 1543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1546| [45] ["!!"]
150: 1557| [45] [The moment he heard "reactor", Natsuhiko was suddenly struck by an unpleasant feeling.]
151: 1565| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1568| [45] ["A-and...?"]
153: 1640| [47] [Salyu]
154: 1643| [45] ["These terrorists hate Communicators and are committing acts of terrorism that will 'end this town's history', correct?"]
155: 1669| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 1672| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
157: 1698| [47] [Salyu]
158: 1701| [45] ["What if we take that to mean their true intention is 'to raze the town in its entirety and destroy the Communicators'?"]
159: 1724| [47] [Natsuhiko & Mashiro]
160: 1727| [45] ["!?"]
161: 1732| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro gasped at the same time.]
162: 1748| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 1751| [45] ["You're right... if you caused a meltdown in the nuclear reactor there, that definitely would do it...!"]
164: 1777| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 1780| [45] ["... No, no, not even a terrorist would do that, would they?"]
166: 1806| [47] [Salyu]
167: 1809| [45] ["Why not? It's the most logical target."]
168: 1835| [47] [Mashiro]
169: 1838| [45] ["Yeah, but..."]
170: 1843| [45] [She couldn't find how to continue.]
171: 1848| [45] [Salyu's idea sounded like a crazy delusion-- but it couldn't necessarily be dismissed as nonsense.]
172: 1853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 1854| [45] [(If they did blow up the nuclear reactor, that certainly would end this town's history...!)]
174: 1883| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 1886| [45] ["You're right... if you caused a meltdown in the nuclear reactor there, that definitely would do it, wouldn't it...!?"]
176: 1894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 1897| [45] ["... No, not even a terrorist would do that, would they?"]
178: 1923| [47] [Salyu]
179: 1926| [45] ["Why not? It's the most logical target."]
180: 1934| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 1937| [45] ["But... still, that's just..."]
182: 1942| [45] [Salyu interrupted with a low mutter.]
183: 1968| [47] [Salyu]
184: 1971| [45] ["You don't believe my theory?"]
185: 1997| [47] [Salyu]
186: 2000| [45] ["I'm not just shooting ideas at random. If you can't accept my line of thought, then that's just because you're not trying to believe, Natsuhiko."]
187: 2008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
188: 2011| [45] ["...!"]
189: 2016| [45] [He found himself at a loss for words for a second, but surely enough, once he thought about it--]
190: 2021| [45] [--What Salyu said may have sounded crazy, but it couldn't necessarily be dismissed as nonsense.]
191: 2026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2027| [45] [(But if they did blow up the nuclear reactor, that certainly would end this town's history...!)]
193: 2032| [45] [The moment he thought that, he suddenly heard Ukita's words playing back in his head.]
194: 2119| [47] [Ukita]
195: 2122| [45] ["You all have probably heard of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster in Ukraine."]
196: 2148| [47] [Ukita]
197: 2151| [45] ["Causing enormous casualties."]
198: 2177| [47] [Ukita]
199: 2180| [45] ["The residents in the vicinity and the firefighters sent in to handle the accident were hit the hardest; over 3000 of them died. And the number only rose after that."]
200: 2281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 2284| [45] ["...!"]
202: 2289| [45] [Natsuhiko shuddered. Mashiro started to tremble.]
203: 2297| [47] [Mashiro]
204: 2300| [45] ["Then you mean the PRC explosion was another diversion..."]
205: 2326| [47] [Mashiro]
206: 2329| [45] ["And Q's real target is LABO!?"]
207: 2337| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2340| [45] ["Calm down, Mashiro! It's just conjecture, that's all!"]
209: 2366| [47] [Salyu]
210: 2369| [45] ["That's right. What I said was nothing more than conjecture."]
211: 2395| [47] [Mashiro]
212: 2398| [45] ["Yeah, but it's still a possibility..."]
213: 2406| [47] [Mashiro]
214: 2409| [45] ["So shouldn't we go to LABO and give them a warning!?"]
215: 2417| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2420| [45] ["M-maybe, but... LABO..."]
217: 2425| [45] [He swallowed his words.]
218: 2486| [45] [--Natsuhiko didn't want to go anywhere near LABO.]
219: 2491| [45] [No matter what Mashiro said.]
220: 2496| [45] [Because he could never forget what happened nine years ago--]
221: 2501| [45] [On July 7, 2021.]
222: 2506| [45] [That was the very same place he had exposed Yuuri to life or death danger.]
223: 2624| [45] [Burned into Natsuhiko's memory was a fire.]
224: 2629| [45] [That day, Natsuhiko and Yuuri sneaked into LABO to see the professor.]
225: 2711| [45] [But a fire broke out...]
226: 2716| [45] [And the kids were trapped in the facility.]
227: 2797| [45] [The fire alarm echoed.]
228: 2856| [45] [Yuuri kept sobbing, and the broadcast voice kept repeating--]
229: 2862| [47] [Automatic PA]
230: 2865| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
231: 2870| [47] [Automatic PA]
232: 2873| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
233: 2878| [45] [The gate shut in front of them and wouldn't open.]
234: 2886| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2889| [45] ["Darn it! Why won't it open!"]
236: 2897| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 2900| [45] ["*sob* ... *sob* ..."]
238: 2908| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 2911| [45] ["Wh-what do we do, Hikorin... I'm scared...!"]
240: 2919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 2922| [45] ["Don't cry, Yuuri! I'll do something!"]
242: 2990| [45] [Tears welled up in Natsuhiko's eyes. Tears of fear. Tears of pain from slamming the gate with his fists.]
243: 3023| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 3026| [45] ["*cough* ... *cough* ...!"]
245: 3031| [45] [Eventually Yuuri's coughing started to grow weak.]
246: 3051| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 3052| [45] [(If we stay here, Yuuri's gonna die...!)]
248: 3057| [45] [Natsuhiko carried Yuuri's body and slowly started to walk.]
249: 3062| [45] [The smoke stung his eyes. He began to tear up.]
250: 3067| [45] [His breathing grew rough. His head hurt.]
251: 3072| [45] [And still he aimlessly wandered, searching for a route to survival...]
252: 3134| [45] [... Not even Natsuhiko quite remembered how they were saved after that.]
253: 3139| [45] [He only had the faint memory that someone had come to save them--]
254: 3144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3145| [45] [(We were in the hospital before we knew it...)]
256: 3150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3151| [45] [(But ever since then...!)]
258: 3156| [45] [The terror didn't end with that traumatic experience.]
259: 3161| [45] [Ever since that day, Yuuri could no longer leave the house.]
260: 3166| [45] [--And it wasn't just Yuuri that changed.]
261: 3211| [45] [That day, around the same time as the fire, a small radiation leak occurred within the facility.]
262: 3216| [45] [LABO denied the existence of a leak, and no report was made mentioning it.%NBut considering their efforts after the fact, a radiation leak was the only possible explanation.]
263: 3221| [45] [Natsuhiko was hospitalized for three months following the incident, and even after being discharged, he was required to undergo a yearly physical examination at the hospital.]
264: 3226| [45] [Even now, after nine years had already passed from their narrow escape from death.]
265: 3320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
266: 3321| [45] [(Everything changed after that day...)]
267: 3326| [45] [By now, Natsuhiko displayed essentially no symptoms of radiation exposure. His body was almost perfectly healthy.]
268: 3331| [45] [But with every passing July 7, and with each mention of LABO, he would recall what happened back then.]
269: 3336| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri were still bound together by that incident even now.]
270: 3341| [47] [Natsuhiko]
271: 3342| [45] [(... And yet I have to go to LABO again...!?)]
272: 3347| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind, Natsuhiko began feeling nauseous.]
273: 3352| [45] [He broke out in a cold sweat and his throat went dry.]
274: 3357| [45] [His entire body was tormented by the unpleasant memory.]
275: 3362| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 3363| [45] [(D-dammit...! Is my body refusing to remember...!?)]
277: 3368| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth, held back the urge to vomit, and finally wrung out some words.]
278: 3376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
279: 3379| [45] ["... E-even if Salyu's conjecture is correct...!"]
280: 3387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 3390| [45] ["It's a problem that's out of our hands, Mashiro..."]
