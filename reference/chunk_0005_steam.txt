  1:   22| [45] [The group, led by the lieutenant,]
  2:   65| [45] [approached what appeared to be a connecting passageway.]
  3:  115| [45] [It was blocked by a metal door, but that opened once the lieutenant had operated a nearby terminal.]
  4:  214| [45] [On the other side was another block that looked like it belonged in an office building--]
  5:  219| [47] [Man]
  6:  220| [45] [(This place is huge...)]
  7:  225| [45] [Just then, the lieutenant turned to the man and spoke.]
  8:  287| [47] [Lieutenant]
  9:  290| [45] ["Captain, which would you rather know first-- your personal information or the situation?"]
 10:  298| [47] [Man]
 11:  301| [45] ["Oh, uh... my personal information, please."]
 12:  327| [47] [Lieutenant]
 13:  330| [45] ["Understood. Then let's start with your name--"]
 14:  338| [47] [Lieutenant]
 15:  341| [45] ["It's 'Watase Kasasagi'."]
 16:  349| [47] [Watase]
 17:  352| [45] ["Watase Kasasagi... so that's my name."]
 18:  357| [45] [The man-- no, "Watase", listened to the lieutenant list off facts about him with a strange feeling in his heart.]
 19:  365| [47] [Lieutenant]
 20:  368| [45] ["You're 32 years old and single."]
 21:  379| [47] [Lieutenant]
 22:  382| [45] ["You're a member of the Rokumei City Fire Department's special elite rescue squad, 'Sirius'.%NYour rank is Fire Lieutenant."]
 23:  390| [47] [Lieutenant]
 24:  393| [45] ["And you're our squad's captain. In other words, that makes you our direct superior."]
 25:  419| [47] [Lieutenant]
 26:  422| [45] ["Is any of this bringing back any memories?"]
 27:  430| [47] [Watase]
 28:  433| [45] ["No... not ringing any bells."]
 29:  505| [47] [Lieutenant]
 30:  508| [45] ["I see..."]
 31:  516| [47] [Watase]
 32:  519| [45] ["By the way... what're your names?"]
 33:  545| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  548| [45] ["Oh, forgive me for not telling you sooner. I'm 'Kazami Tachibana', Fire Sergeant."]
 35:  556| [47] [Kazami]
 36:  559| [45] ["I serve in this squad as your lieutenant."]
 37:  564| [45] [Watase carved this information into his memory.]
 38:  652| [47] [Watase]
 39:  653| [45] [(Kazami Tachibana-- my lieutenant, huh. Seems like the cool and collected type, if you ask me...)]
 40:  658| [45] [The woman named Kazami appeared to be strict-- both towards herself and others.]
 41:  719| [47] [Watase]
 42:  722| [45] ["Um, can I call you Ms. Kazami...?"]
 43:  748| [47] [Kazami]
 44:  751| [45] ["..."]
 45:  834| [47] [Watase]
 46:  835| [45] [(Kazami Tachibana-- my lieutenant, huh. Seems rather cold, if you ask me...)]
 47:  840| [45] [The woman named Kazami appeared to be strict-- both towards herself and others.]
 48:  901| [47] [Watase]
 49:  904| [45] ["Um, can I call you Lieutenant...?"]
 50:  930| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  933| [45] ["No, please call me Tachibana instead. There's no need to be formal with me."]
 52:  966| [45] [Watase nodded. Just then, the other rescue worker spoke up.]
 53:  992| [47] [Jun]
 54:  995| [45] ["And I'm 'Jun Moribe', Firefighter, 20 years old! I only just joined Sirus this year, so I'm whatcha'd call the team's 'new blood'!"]
 55: 1021| [47] [Jun]
 56: 1024| [45] ["My nickname's 'Sirius' Lady Suicide Squad Chief'! My catchphrase is 'Jun's my name, rescue's my game!' Let's get along, okay!?"]
 57: 1029| [45] [She felt like the complete opposite of Kazami.]
 58: 1111| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1112| [45] [(Jun Moribe-- the team's newest recruit, huh. She sure is a bright bundle of energy.)]
 60: 1117| [45] [She seemed to have a fierce will, and yet a cheerful and friendly personality.]
 61: 1122| [45] [She didn't appear to be very conscious of the hierarchy in the group, perhaps because she was a lot younger than her superiors.]
 62: 1174| [47] [Kazami]
 63: 1177| [45] ["Please excuse her attitude... I keep telling to her to do something about it, but it just doesn't sink in."]
 64: 1203| [47] [Jun]
 65: 1206| [45] ["I usually -am- careful about it. It's just that when I get to work, I get caught up in the heat of things and can't hold myself back, y'know?"]
 66: 1214| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1217| [45] ["Yeah, I don't mind at all. Actually, it makes things a lot more comfortable for me."]
 68: 1243| [47] [Jun]
 69: 1246| [45] ["Woohoo! You're so understanding today, Captain!"]
 70: 1251| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1252| [45] [(Well, it looks like she's got the skills to make up for it.)]
 72: 1257| [45] [She'd have to have nerves of steel to stay so cheerful in a situation like this.]
 73: 1334| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1335| [45] [(Jun Moribe-- the team's newest recruit, huh. Seems a bit too wild, if you ask me...)]
 75: 1340| [45] [She didn't appear to be very conscious of the hierarchy in the group, perhaps because she was a lot younger than her superiors.]
 76: 1392| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1395| [45] ["Please excuse her attitude... I keep telling to her to do something about it, but it just doesn't sink in."]
 78: 1403| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1406| [45] ["Yeah, now that you mention it, it doesn't feel like she really chooses her words carefully when it comes to talking to her superiors..."]
 80: 1432| [47] [Jun]
 81: 1435| [45] ["I usually -am- careful about it. It's just that when I get to work, I get caught up in the heat of things and can't hold myself back, y'know?"]
 82: 1443| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1446| [45] ["I see... well, I'm okay with that."]
 84: 1451| [45] [To see it from a more positive standpoint, one could say she had nerves of steel to be able to stay cheerful even in this situation.]
 85: 1509| [45] [Watase then turned to the last member of the party as that thought crossed his mind.]
 86: 1535| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1538| [45] ["So then, what's your name, missy?"]
 88: 1599| [47] [Girl]
 89: 1602| [45] ["!?"]
 90: 1667| [45] [The girl hid herself behind Jun as soon as Watase asked.]
 91: 1693| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1696| [45] ["Oh boy, doesn't look like she's warming up to you all that much, Captain."]
 93: 1722| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1725| [45] ["Well then, would you tell me your name, missy?"]
 95: 1760| [47] [Girl]
 96: 1763| [45] ["..."]
 97: 1771| [47] [Girl]
 98: 1774| [45] ["... ri."]
 99: 1800| [47] [Jun]
100: 1803| [45] ["Huh?"]
101: 1829| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1832| [45] ["'Yuuri'."]
103: 1837| [45] [The girl only gave her first name.]
104: 1863| [47] [Jun]
105: 1866| [45] ["Yuuri, huh? Aw, that's a cute name. Nice to meet you!"]
106: 1942| [45] ["Yuuri"--something about that name bugged Watase.]
107: 1947| [47] [Watase]
108: 1948| [45] [(It feels like I've heard that name somewhere before...)]
109: 1953| [45] [But no matter how much he studied her face or searched his memories, he couldn't remember anything solid.]
110: 1958| [45] [So he decided to give up and turned his attention back to Kazami.]
111: 2019| [47] [Watase]
112: 2022| [45] ["Okay then, now that we're done introducing ourselves... could you please explain what's going now?"]
113: 2048| [47] [Kazami]
114: 2051| [45] ["Roger that. Then let me explain this facility first--"]
115: 2056| [45] [Kazami then quietly began to speak.]
116: 2103| [47] [Kazami]
117: 2106| [45] ["We're in a nuclear research facility located on the outskirts of a city known as Rokumei City."]
118: 2114| [47] [Watase]
119: 2117| [45] ["Could you be a bit more specific on that first part...?"]
120: 2125| [47] [Kazami]
121: 2128| [45] ["I don't know the details, but it more or less seems to be a facility for conducting research related to nuclear power."]
122: 2136| [47] [Kazami]
123: 2139| [45] ["The facility's name is the '6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization'-- known as 'LABO' for short."]
124: 2186| [47] [Kazami]
125: 2189| [45] ["It's a facility with two floors and two underground floors, with the latter housing a 'nuclear reactor' used for research purposes."]
126: 2236| [47] [Kazami]
127: 2239| [45] ["But at 6:19 AM earlier today-- that's September 16th, 2030, to be exact--"]
128: 2247| [47] [Kazami]
129: 2250| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origins occurred in the basement levels."]
130: 2297| [47] [Kazami]
131: 2300| [45] ["Fires broke out all over the place at the same time, and part of the facility's control system malfunctioned as a result."]
132: 2347| [47] [Kazami]
133: 2350| [45] ["There were concerns about the possibility that the nuclear reactor's cooling functions would malfunction as well and cause a meltdown if things kept going the way they did--"]
134: 2358| [47] [Kazami]
135: 2361| [45] ["So they sent a rescue request to Sirius, since we're trained to handle these kinds of disasters."]
136: 2369| [47] [Kazami]
137: 2372| [45] ["... We then arrived on the scene at 6:26 AM and commenced our search for those still trapped."]
138: 2416| [45] [Watase looked at the sturdy watch around his wrist.]
139: 2427| [45] [Its digital display read "9:27 AM".]
140: 2474| [47] [Watase]
141: 2477| [45] ["So that was about three hours ago, huh..."]
142: 2485| [47] [Kazami]
143: 2488| [45] ["When we got here, we split into two teams of five-- Teams A and B. We're Team A."]
144: 2536| [47] [Kazami]
145: 2539| [45] ["You set up a command post on the first floor and commanded Team A from there."]
146: 2586| [47] [Kazami]
147: 2589| [45] ["Team A was split into 2 two-man cells-- me and Moribe, and two other workers named Dojima and Hiyama."]
148: 2636| [47] [Kazami]
149: 2639| [45] ["But after that... we lost contact with the Dojima/Hiyama party. We then lost contact with you."]
150: 2647| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2650| [45] ["This was around 6:35 AM."]
152: 2697| [47] [Watase]
153: 2700| [45] ["What happened...?"]
154: 2708| [47] [Kazami]
155: 2711| [45] ["The three of you might have gone down to the basement floors at that time."]
156: 2719| [47] [Kazami]
157: 2722| [45] ["Reception's really bad down here, so our radios are nearly useless in that sort of situation."]
158: 2769| [47] [Watase]
159: 2772| [45] ["I see... But why'd we go down to the basement to begin with?"]
160: 2780| [47] [Kazami]
161: 2783| [45] ["It's possible that you went to rescue survivors."]
162: 2791| [47] [Kazami]
163: 2794| [45] ["According to members of LABO staff, the basement floors had already been evacuated and the only survivors still there were trapped in the above-ground floors, but--"]
164: 2802| [47] [Jun]
165: 2805| [45] ["While we were saving them, we found out there were survivors in the basement too.%NSo the lieutenant and I headed there."]
166: 2852| [47] [Jun]
167: 2855| [45] ["But the fires down there were much worse than we'd expected, so we got stuck for a while. By the time we could move again, we'd lost sight of the survivors..."]
168: 2863| [47] [Kazami]
169: 2866| [45] ["It was then that we set up a makeshift base on floor B2 and resumed our rescue activities once again."]
170: 2874| [47] [Kazami]
171: 2877| [45] ["Then right after that, around 7:15 AM--"]
172: 2885| [47] [Kazami]
173: 2888| [45] ["A most ominous announcement about a 'Case N' was broadcast throughout the entire facility."]
174: 2935| [47] [Watase]
175: 2938| [45] ["A Case N...? What's that?"]
176: 2946| [47] [Kazami]
177: 2949| [45] ["Given the nature of this facility, it's probably short for 'Nuclear'."]
178: 2957| [47] [Jun]
179: 2960| [45] ["We've got something in the rescue world we call an 'N disaster'. In that case, 'N' refers to a nuclear-induced disaster."]
180: 3014| [47] [Watase]
181: 3017| [45] ["Nuclear, huh... so you're saying that warning was something nuclear-related..."]
182: 3025| [47] [Kazami]
183: 3028| [45] ["Yes. We believe that a meltdown occurred in the reactor area at that time."]
184: 3036| [47] [Kazami]
185: 3039| [45] ["We checked our Procyons right after the announcement and discovered that the radiation levels had grown abnormally high. So we're pretty confident in our theory."]
186: 3086| [47] [Jun]
187: 3089| [45] ["So basically, this 'Case N' thing is probably slang for 'meltdown'."]
188: 3132| [45] [By the time they'd finished explaining, the group had arrived in Area 2.]
189: 3148| [47] [Watase]
190: 3151| [45] ["--Then doesn't that mean we need to get this girl out of here as soon as possible?"]
191: 3228| [45] [Watase looked towards Yuuri.]
192: 3233| [45] [She looked even more scared than she did earlier.]
193: 3296| [47] [Kazami]
194: 3299| [45] ["Yes, we agree, it's just..."]
195: 3326| [47] [Jun]
196: 3329| [45] ["The staircase leading to the surface is here in 'Area 2', but..."]
197: 3334| [45] [Kazami and Jun paused, then looked down the hall.]
198: 3339| [45] [Standing there was a door with a plate that read "Emergency Staircase".]
199: 3347| [47] [Watase]
200: 3350| [45] ["What's do you mean, 'but'?"]
201: 3358| [47] [Watase]
202: 3361| [45] ["The exit's right there, isn't it? Then let's go, Yuuri!"]
203: 3387| [47] [Kazami]
204: 3390| [45] ["Ah, Captain, please wait!"]
205: 3395| [45] [Watase ran towards the door, Kazami's voice grow fainter and fainter with each step.]
206: 3449| [45] [He ascended the dark staircase.]
207: 3499| [45] [But when he saw what awaited him at the top, Watase found himself rendered speechless.]
208: 3513| [47] [Watase]
209: 3516| [45] ["Wh... what the hell... is this!?"]
210: 3521| [45] [An iron wall was lying just a short distance away from the top of the stairs.]
211: 3583| [47] [Kazami]
212: 3586| [45] ["--And there you have it."]
213: 3591| [45] [By the time he came to his senses, Kazami and the others were standing right behind him.]
214: 3602| [47] [Watase]
215: 3605| [45] ["... So what about the exit? Isn't it too dangerous for us to be here for too long?"]
216: 3667| [47] [Kazami]
217: 3670| [45] ["We agree, it's just..."]
218: 3697| [47] [Jun]
219: 3700| [45] ["The staircase leading to the surface is here in 'Area 2', but..."]
220: 3705| [45] [Kazami and Jun paused, then looked down the hall.]
221: 3710| [45] [Standing there was a door with a plate that read "Emergency Staircase".]
222: 3718| [47] [Watase]
223: 3721| [45] ["What's wrong... is there a problem with it or something?"]
224: 3747| [47] [Kazami]
225: 3750| [45] ["... I think you'll understand much quicker if you see it for yourself."]
226: 3758| [47] [Watase]
227: 3761| [45] ["Huh...?"]
228: 3766| [45] [Kazami paid no heed to Watase's confusion and opened the door instead.]
229: 3820| [45] [The group ascended the dark staircase.]
230: 3870| [45] [And once he saw what was there, Watase couldn't help but gasp.]
231: 3884| [47] [Watase]
232: 3887| [45] ["Wh... what the hell... is this!?"]
233: 3892| [45] [An iron wall was lying just a short distance away from the top of the stairs.]
234: 3954| [47] [Kazami]
235: 3957| [45] ["--And there you have it."]
236: 3965| [47] [Watase]
237: 3968| [45] ["Wh-what do you mean, 'there you have it'...!?"]
238: 3994| [47] [Kazami]
239: 3997| [45] ["The truth of the matter is that all exits to the surface are currently blocked off by this 'bulkhead'--"]
240: 4023| [47] [Kazami]
241: 4026| [45] ["Meaning we're trapped down here in LABO's basement floors."]
242: 4034| [47] [Watase]
243: 4037| [45] ["Trapped!? Why!?"]
244: 4063| [47] [Kazami]
245: 4066| [45] ["... I don't know."]
246: 4092| [47] [Kazami]
247: 4095| [45] ["That said, the PA did say that they were locking down all bulkheads leading to the surface at the same time it announced the Case N."]
248: 4121| [47] [Kazami]
249: 4124| [45] ["So there's probably no way out..."]
250: 4132| [47] [Watase]
251: 4135| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
252: 4143| [47] [Watase]
253: 4146| [45] ["Can't you just contact someone on the outside and ask them to open it up!?"]
254: 4173| [47] [Jun]
255: 4176| [45] ["We can't get in touch with 'em."]
256: 4202| [47] [Jun]
257: 4205| [45] ["All the landline phones here are dead, and the radio was working good enough at first..."]
258: 4231| [47] [Jun]
259: 4234| [45] ["But then reception kept getting worse and worse for some reason, and now our chances of reaching them are pretty much zilch."]
260: 4242| [47] [Watase]
261: 4245| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
262: 4253| [47] [Watase]
263: 4256| [45] ["Then can't we just break it or force it open!?"]
264: 4282| [45] [Watase tried pounding his fists on the bulkhead.]
265: 4287| [45] [But it didn't budge an inch.]
266: 4316| [47] [Watase]
267: 4319| [45] ["Goddammit! Open up, you piece of shit!"]
268: 4324| [45] [But no matter how hard he punched, kicked, or pushed it, nothing changed.]
269: 4329| [45] [It didn't look like something that could be dealt with human hands alone.]
270: 4337| [47] [Watase]
271: 4340| [45] ["Khh... looks like we can't do anything to it without any explosives or something...!"]
272: 4366| [47] [Jun]
273: 4369| [45] ["Hate to break it to you, but we don't have any. We can't destroy it with the equipment we have on hand."]
274: 4395| [47] [Kazami]
275: 4398| [45] ["Though it's annoying to admit... this bulkhead has completely split the basement and surface apart."]
276: 4403| [45] [Watase finally understood the situation when he heard Kazami and Jun's comments.]
277: 4408| [45] [But it was a hard pill to swallow.]
278: 4416| [47] [Watase]
279: 4419| [45] ["Isn't there any other possible way out of here...?"]
280: 4445| [47] [Kazami]
281: 4448| [45] ["... Negative."]
282: 4474| [47] [Kazami]
283: 4477| [45] ["We've tried all sorts of things ourselves in the two hours we've been trapped here, but nothing worked."]
284: 4485| [47] [Kazami]
285: 4488| [45] ["We can't go through the air ducts. All the elevators are out of order. And we can't break the ceiling."]
286: 4514| [47] [Jun]
287: 4517| [45] ["What's worse, this facility is supposed to have this flawless sprinkler system--"]
288: 4525| [47] [Jun]
289: 4528| [45] ["But it's not working for some reason. So we don't just have fires breaking out all over the place, but we've got no way to find out where they're coming from."]
290: 4536| [47] [Watase]
291: 4539| [45] ["Wh... what the hell!? Then we're in real deep shit now, aren't we!?"]
292: 4547| [47] [Watase]
293: 4550| [45] ["We're all full of radiation, there's fire everywhere, and we can't even get outside!?"]
294: 4558| [47] [Watase]
295: 4561| [45] ["Why the hell is this--"]
296: 4587| [47] [Kazami]
297: 4590| [45] ["Please calm down! Having a rescue captain lose his cool will only make matters worse!"]
298: 4616| [47] [Jun]
299: 4619| [45] ["She's right, Captain! Can't you see that all you're doing is scaring poor Yuuri to death?!"]
300: 4723| [47] [Watase]
301: 4726| [45] ["!!"]
302: 4731| [45] [With realization hitting him in full force, Watase looked at Yuuri.]
303: 4736| [45] [She was hiding behind Jun and looking at him with trembling eyes.]
304: 4744| [47] [Watase]
305: 4747| [45] ["Ah... I-I'm sorry."]
306: 4752| [47] [Yuuri]
307: 4753| [45] ["..."]
308: 4758| [45] [Kazami and Jun were right: he couldn't show such disgraceful behavior in front of a frail girl like Yuuri.]
309: 4763| [45] [Regardless of his amnesia, Watase had most likely come down to the basement floors in order to "rescue people".]
310: 4768| [45] [But at that moment, he was hit by a sudden question.]
311: 4776| [47] [Watase]
312: 4779| [45] ["Oh, come to think of it... what were you doing here in LABO, Yuuri?"]
313: 4858| [47] [Yuuri]
314: 4861| [45] ["...!"]
315: 4884| [45] [Just then, a tearful look appeared on Yuuri's face for some reason.]
316: 4892| [47] [Watase]
317: 4895| [45] ["Wh-what's wrong?"]
318: 4903| [47] [Yuuri]
319: 4906| [45] ["I-I'm..."]
320: 4932| [47] [Yuuri]
321: 4935| [45] ["Um... I'm family to one of the people who work here."]
322: 4943| [47] [Yuuri]
323: 4946| [45] ["And so... I happened to get caught up in all this by bad luck..."]
324: 4954| [47] [Watase]
325: 4957| [45] ["I see... that's a disaster for you."]
326: 4962| [45] [Watase turned to his thoughts as he kept looking at Yuuri.]
327: 4967| [47] [Watase]
328: 4968| [45] [(It really has been a disaster... for all of us.)]
329: 4973| [47] [Watase]
330: 4974| [45] [(I really wish we could all get out of here...!)]
331: 4979| [45] [But he knew it wasn't that simple.]
332: 4984| [45] [In the first place, there was still way too much that he didn't know about his current situation.]
333: 4989| [45] [Why wouldn't the bulkhead open up? Why wasn't the sprinkler system working?]
334: 4994| [45] [Why had he lost his memories? And--]
335: 5120| [47] [Watase]
336: 5123| [45] ["Say, Tachibana... what's our next move?"]
337: 5131| [47] [Kazami]
338: 5134| [45] ["... I'd like to explain that to you in detail."]
339: 5161| [47] [Jun]
340: 5164| [45] ["We've got a simple makeshift base set up nearby, so let's head there first."]
341: 5169| [45] [They had no choice but to go along with what she said.]
342: 5174| [45] [And so the group's shoulders slumped as they proceeded down the staircase.]
