  1:   61| [45] [No sooner had they exited than did the Procyon alarm start beeping.]
  2:   75| [47] [Watase]
  3:   78| [45] ["...!"]
  4:   90| [45] [The reading on its display showed "4000 mSv"--]
  5:   95| [45] [It appeared that the contamination had spread to the factory too, shooting the radiation levels up to the first danger standard.]
  6:  100| [47] [Watase]
  7:  101| [45] [(The whole facility could suffer the same fate if this keeps up...!)]
  8:  106| [45] [That was a problem just as grave as the body they'd just found.]
  9:  111| [45] [This meant that they weren't guaranteed to survive in this hellish place even with AD.]
 10:  119| [47] [Watase]
 11:  122| [45] ["Tachibana, Moribe, old man, give yourselves some AD too."]
 12:  130| [47] [Watase]
 13:  133| [45] ["I know there's a lot on your minds right now, but you have to!"]
 14:  159| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  162| [45] ["... Yes."]
 16:  189| [47] [Jun]
 17:  192| [45] ["Let's do it... we don't want to die, after all."]
 18:  217| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  218| [45] ["..."]
 20:  268| [45] [Their lives had been extended for another hour yet again. But this time--]
 21:  273| [47] [Watase]
 22:  274| [45] [(... Our escape route's been cut off.)]
 23:  279| [47] [Watase]
 24:  280| [45] [(At this rate, we'll need to inject ourselves with AD five more times...!)]
 25:  285| [45] [But they'd already used up all the AD they had.]
 26:  290| [45] [They'd searched what'd felt like the entire facility so far-- so unless they'd missed some AD somewhere, they'd all be exposed to radiation in just an hour.]
 27:  295| [47] [Watase]
 28:  296| [45] [(But in that case...)]
 29:  301| [47] [Watase]
 30:  302| [45] [(Does that mean we have to look through all the areas again? Search every nook and cranny in more depth than last time...!?)]
 31:  327| [45] [He shook his head as soon as he thought that.]
 32:  332| [45] [With their one light of hope having been so cruelly snuffed out, all his fatigue was catching up to him at once.]
 33:  337| [45] [His body wasn't in perfect shape either, what with his cracked ribs and the cut on the back of his head--]
 34:  342| [45] [His eyes that had been stung by smoke so many times suddenly started hurting.]
 35:  347| [45] [Everyone's faces were equally filled with bewilderment.]
 36:  421| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  422| [45] ["..."]
 38:  427| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  428| [45] ["..."]
 40:  486| [45] [No one said a word.]
 41:  491| [45] [They were just all so confused about the incredibly unexpected sight they'd seen in the room.]
 42:  496| [47] [Watase]
 43:  497| [45] [(But we still have to keep on searching...!)]
 44:  503| [45] [A voice started pouring out of Watase's PDA as he thought that.]
 45:  508| [47] [Commander]
 46:  511| [45] ["... Kasa... --ead me? --... Kasasagi, do you read me!?"]
 47:  525| [47] [Watase]
 48:  528| [45] ["!"]
 49:  533| [45] [It was Commander Murakami again!]
 50:  538| [45] [Watase took out his PDA in shock.]
 51:  589| [47] [Watase]
 52:  592| [45] ["Loud and clear! This is Kasasagi, over!"]
 53:  597| [47] [Commander]
 54:  600| [45] ["...sagi! We finally got in to...--"]
 55:  605| [45] [There was much more static on this radio transmission than the previous ones.]
 56:  610| [47] [Commander]
 57:  613| [45] ["--...ception is extremely unstab--... is will probably be the las-- ...nsmission--..."]
 58:  618| [47] [Commander]
 59:  621| [45] ["...--...mething I need to tel--..."]
 60:  629| [47] [Watase]
 61:  632| [45] ["Commander! I can't hear you!"]
 62:  637| [47] [Commander]
 63:  640| [45] ["...ldn't find anyone wi--.... gun."]
 64:  645| [47] [Commander]
 65:  648| [45] ["We can't confirm if there's a killer-- ...r not."]
 66:  653| [45] [They could tell he was saying something like "We couldn't find anyone with a gun. We can't confirm if there's a killer here or not".]
 67:  661| [47] [Watase]
 68:  664| [45] ["Got it! What else!?"]
 69:  669| [47] [Commander]
 70:  672| [45] ["According to-- ...rapped there aside from you gu...--...--..."]
 71:  677| [47] [Commander]
 72:  680| [45] ["...ones possibly trapped there--... including the dead...-- Dojima and Hiyama... rese--..."]
 73:  685| [45] [The commander desperately tried to give Watase's group the information they needed in the intervals between the loud bursts of static.]
 74:  690| [47] [Commander]
 75:  693| [45] ["I repea... ...pped down there are, in-- ...yama, two researchers..."]
 76:  698| [45] [It seemed like he was repeating the same message over and over again.]
 77:  703| [45] [The group gathered around Watase's PDA and did their best not to miss a single word--%Nno, a single letter that he spoke.]
 78:  708| [47] [Commander]
 79:  711| [45] ["--...-- Dojima and Hiyama, two research--...--"]
 80:  716| [47] [Commander]
 81:  719| [45] ["...--...--searchers, three high school stude-- ...nd two--...--...--"]
 82:  724| [47] [Commander]
 83:  727| [45] ["...--...--gh school students...-- two girls--...--...--...--"]
 84:  732| [47] [Commander]
 85:  735| [45] ["...--...--scue-- --vivors--... work--..."]
 86:  740| [47] [Commander]
 87:  743| [45] ["...--you all-- ...vive as we--...--"]
 88:  748| [47] [Commander]
 89:  751| [45] ["...--...--survive--...--...--...--"]
 90:  756| [47] [Commander]
 91:  759| [45] ["--...--...--...--..."]
 92:  764| [45] [The transmission ended there.]
 93:  769| [45] [All that could be heard was white noise.]
 94:  804| [47] [Watase]
 95:  807| [45] ["Was that a list of the survivors...!?"]
 96:  812| [45] [Watase put the PDA away. Kazami, who'd finally regained her wits, spoke up.]
 97:  838| [47] [Kazami]
 98:  841| [45] ["Y-yes. He was probably trying to tell us who else was possibly trapped in here."]
 99:  868| [47] [Jun]
100:  871| [45] ["... What do you think he said?"]
101:  879| [47] [Watase]
102:  882| [45] ["From what I can piece together, he said--%N'the ones trapped down there, including the dead, are...'"]
103:  908| [47] [Kazami]
104:  911| [45] ["'... Dojima and Hiyama', 'two researchers', I think?"]
105:  939| [47] [Ukita]
106:  942| [45] ["He then said 'three high school students'...!"]
107:  968| [47] [Ena]
108:  971| [45] ["Wait, that wasn't all. He also said one more thing after that."]
109:  979| [47] [Watase]
110:  982| [45] ["Oh yeah, I think it was 'two girls'?"]
111: 1008| [47] [Jun]
112: 1011| [45] ["By girls, do you think he meant..."]
113: 1016| [45] [Everyone's eyes focused on Yuuri all at once.]
114: 1094| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1097| [45] ["Ah..."]
116: 1123| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1126| [45] ["I-I think... I'm probably one of them..."]
118: 1134| [47] [Watase]
119: 1137| [45] ["Figured as much. Then the other one must've been that girl..."]
120: 1219| [45] [Watase then got to thinking.]
121: 1224| [45] [Out of all the people the commander had said were still trapped there--]
122: 1229| [45] ["Dojima and Hiyama", "the two researchers", and "one of the girls" were already dead.]
123: 1234| [45] [Apart from that, there was "one other girl (Yuuri)" and "three high school students".]
124: 1242| [47] [Watase]
125: 1245| [45] ["So those three kids really haven't escaped after all...!?"]
126: 1250| [45] [Ena was taken aback at Watase's words.]
127: 1305| [47] [Ena]
128: 1308| [45] ["Then those kids must be lying unconscious somewhere...!"]
129: 1334| [47] [Ena]
130: 1337| [45] ["Th-this is bad! We must have overlooked them!"]
131: 1363| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1366| [45] ["Please calm down, Ms. Tsubakiyama!"]
133: 1374| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1377| [45] ["There's still a possibility that they're moving around!"]
135: 1403| [47] [Ena]
136: 1406| [45] ["Huh!?"]
137: 1432| [47] [Kazami]
138: 1435| [45] ["We have been moving together as much as possible, and have consistently been searching in only one direction for the most part."]
139: 1443| [47] [Kazami]
140: 1446| [45] ["That means there's enough room to assume that we have merely missed each other."]
141: 1451| [45] [The group had indeed searched all the areas, including the contaminated zones.]
142: 1456| [45] [So if Kazami's theory was correct, then it made total sense why they hadn't found them yet...!]
143: 1482| [47] [Ena]
144: 1485| [45] ["B-but still! That's all the more reason we need to look for them right away!"]
145: 1493| [47] [Watase]
146: 1496| [45] ["Hold on, Teach! We still need to think some things through before we go do that!"]
147: 1522| [47] [Ena]
148: 1525| [45] ["Like what!?"]
149: 1533| [47] [Watase]
150: 1536| [45] ["Like the situation we're in right now."]
151: 1562| [47] [Ena]
152: 1565| [45] ["...!"]
153: 1570| [45] [Watase was talking about the cargo lift room-- the room with the body.]
154: 1578| [47] [Watase]
155: 1581| [45] ["When you consider the fact that there was a mysterious girl's body right by what was supposed to be our ticket out of here... you have to ask..."]
156: 1589| [47] [Watase]
157: 1592| [45] ["... Just what in the hell... have we gotten ourselves mixed up in?"]
158: 1597| [45] [There was no one who could answer that question.]
