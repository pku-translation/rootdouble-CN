  1:   32| [47] [Watase]
  2:   35| [45] ["T-Teach!"]
  3:   40| [45] [Watase tried to follow her right away--]
  4:   45| [45] [Only to be stopped by the image of Ukita and Jun's faces, full of hostility towards him, flashing through his mind.]
  5:  202| [47] [Watase]
  6:  203| [45] [(Khh... dammit, she's right! If I go out there, all I'll do is rile them up...!)]
  7:  208| [45] [Watase decided to give up on following Ena after he thought that.]
  8:  213| [45] [However, anxiety welled up in his chest.]
  9:  218| [47] [Watase]
 10:  219| [45] [(But... will Teach really be able to persuade them all by herself?)]
 11:  224| [47] [Watase]
 12:  225| [45] [(What if they doubt her because she defended me back at the surveillance room?)]
 13:  230| [45] [But it was too late now.]
 14:  235| [47] [Watase]
 15:  236| [45] [(Teach... please get through to them...!)]
 16:  241| [45] [Watase waited for Ena to return, desperately praying for her success--]
 17:  306| [45] [--Yet as time passed, there was no sign of her.]
 18:  355| [47] [Watase]
 19:  356| [45] [(... She's late...)]
 20:  361| [47] [Watase]
 21:  362| [45] [(What's up with Teach...? She said she'd be right back...!)]
 22:  367| [47] [Watase]
 23:  368| [45] [(--Could something have happened to her!?)]
 24:  373| [47] [Watase]
 25:  374| [45] [(Don't tell me she failed to persuade them and then got...!?)]
 26:  379| [45] [That thought ignited the anxiety that had been smoldering inside of him up until now.]
 27:  535| [47] [Watase]
 28:  536| [45] [(--Dammit! I knew I never should have let Teach go alone!)]
 29:  541| [45] [Having finally reached the limits of his patience, Watase went running out of the office.]
 30:  651| [45] [There was no trace of anyone in the hallways.]
 31:  656| [45] [In fact, it was so quiet that it sent shivers down Watase's spine.]
 32:  661| [45] [He began shouting at the top of his lungs without any regard for his current plight.]
 33:  669| [47] [Watase]
 34:  672| [45] ["Teach, where are you!? Say something if you can hear me!"]
 35:  677| [45] [There was no answer.]
 36:  685| [47] [Watase]
 37:  688| [45] ["--Shit!"]
 38:  693| [45] [Watase urged himself onwards and ran down the hallway.]
 39:  845| [45] [--Area 2, outer ring, B2--]
 40:  853| [47] [Watase]
 41:  856| [45] ["Teach! Where are you!? Can you hear me!?"]
 42:  861| [45] [But there was no answer.]
 43:  866| [45] [It seemed this block too was cloaked in silence.]
 44:  871| [45] [The chills running down Watase's spine only intensified.]
 45:  879| [47] [Watase]
 46:  882| [45] ["Teach! Old man! Moribe!"]
 47:  890| [47] [Watase]
 48:  893| [45] ["Someone, anybody, please say something!"]
 49:  898| [45] [The bad feeling he had only got worse.]
 50:  903| [45] [He wanted to make sure Ena was safe as soon as possible, even if it meant getting caught.]
 51:  908| [47] [Watase]
 52:  909| [45] [(Where is she!? Where did Teach go!?)]
 53:  958| [45] [Watase went recklessly running around LABO--]
 54: 1003| [45] [He soon found himself stopping near a connecting passageway.]
 55: 1008| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1009| [45] [(Isn't this...?)]
 57: 1014| [45] [It was the place where they'd all first met Ena.]
 58: 1019| [45] [There was a corner up ahead.]
 59: 1024| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1025| [45] [(That's right, we found Teach right after we rounded that corner...!)]
 61: 1151| [45] [It was a memory of only a few hours ago, but one that made him even more anxious for some reason.]
 62: 1156| [45] [His mouth was parched.]
 63: 1161| [45] [Watase gulped deeply, then slowly headed down the passageway.]
 64: 1223| [45] [He then peeked around the corner--]
 65: 1274| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1277| [45] ["--!"]
 67: 1282| [45] [Watase's eyes went wide.]
 68: 1287| [45] [Ena was lying on the ground right there.]
 69: 1301| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1304| [45] ["Teach!"]
 71: 1360| [45] [Watase ran over to her and frantically helped her up.]
 72: 1365| [45] [And when he did--]
 73: 1475| [45] [Ena's head dangled limply.]
 74: 1483| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1486| [45] ["... Aah..."]
 76: 1491| [45] [Her body was still warm.]
 77: 1496| [45] [Watase pressed his fingers against her neck-- No pulse. None.]
 78: 1501| [45] [He checked her pupils-- they were dilating.]
 79: 1506| [45] [He then took off his Vital Checker and wrapped it around Ena's wrist-- all five lights shone red.]
 80: 1511| [45] [There was a bullet hole gouged through her forehead that exited out at the back of her head...]
 81: 1516| [45] [There was no need to check anything else.]
 82: 1521| [45] [Ena-- was dead.]
 83: 1526| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1527| [45] ["..."]
 85: 1532| [45] [Watase found himself utterly speechless.]
 86: 1537| [45] [Before long, a sound escaped from his chest.]
 87: 1584| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1587| [45] ["... Uw... aah..."]
 89: 1595| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1598| [45] ["... Uwaaa..."]
 91: 1606| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1609| [45] ["... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
 93: 1617| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1620| [45] ["Why!? Why!?"]
 95: 1628| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1631| [45] ["Why is Teach dead!?"]
 97: 1636| [45] [There was no one there to answer his question.]
 98: 1641| [45] [Ena's now dull eyes were staring off into space.]
 99: 1649| [47] [Watase]
100: 1652| [45] ["... Why..."]
101: 1657| [47] [Watase]
102: 1658| [45] ["..."]
103: 1666| [47] [Watase]
104: 1669| [45] ["... Teach...!"]
105: 1674| [45] [Watase held Ena's body to his chest.]
106: 1679| [45] [He could feel the remaining warmth in her body slipping away little by little...]
107: 1737| [45] [...]
108: 1742| [45] [...]
109: 1747| [45] [... He lost track of the passage of time.]
110: 1752| [45] [Once the heat from Ena's body had completely vanished,]
111: 1757| [45] [Watase rose to his feet, and lifted her body in his arms.]
112: 1808| [47] [Watase]
113: 1811| [45] ["... Let's go, Teach."]
114: 1819| [47] [Watase]
115: 1822| [45] ["You'd probably hate to be left in a place like this..."]
116: 1827| [45] [Watase left the connecting passageway, carrying Ena on his back.]
117: 1832| [45] [--She had been trapped in that passageway when they'd first come across her.]
118: 1837| [45] [So he wanted to take her out of there and lay her to rest in a quiet room at the very least.]
119: 1842| [45] [The room where he'd last spoken to her.]
120: 1886| [45] [Watase kept walking as he felt her weight on his back.]
121: 1891| [45] [He didn't want to think about anything.]
122: 1896| [45] [And yet for some reason--]
123: 1901| [45] [Memories of her came rising and vanishing in his head like bubbles with each step he took.]
124: 1992| [47] [Ena]
125: 1995| [45] ["So you're the captain? You're not exactly instilling much confidence with that whole 'sorta' business."]
126: 2000| [45] [She'd told him that when they'd first met.]
127: 2078| [47] [Ena]
128: 2081| [45] ["How can you be so unprepared!? Aren't you guys supposed to be a rescue squad!?"]
129: 2086| [45] [At first, he'd thought of her only as an unpleasant woman who just complained all the time.]
130: 2129| [45] [--But before long, her attitude began to change little by little.]
131: 2206| [47] [Ena]
132: 2209| [45] ["Oh my, you're finally starting to sound like a man of your station, Captain Amnesia."]
133: 2214| [45] [She began looking at Watase in a new light after witnessing him put his life at risk time and time again.]
134: 2277| [47] [Ena]
135: 2280| [45] ["Don't be modest. You were both manly and incredible."]
136: 2285| [45] [Over time, they had gradually come to understand one another.]
137: 2363| [47] [Ena]
138: 2366| [45] ["What are you doing, Captain Kasasagi...!?"]
139: 2374| [47] [Ena]
140: 2377| [45] ["You have to get a hold of yourself."]
141: 2382| [45] [Though she would scold him at times, her words would help Watase press onwards.]
142: 2426| [45] [Trapped in this hell with Death hovering behind them...]
143: 2431| [45] [--They looked for the survivors and a way to survive together, but then--]
144: 2511| [47] [Ena]
145: 2514| [45] ["As long as you stay the way you are now... as long you're 'Captain Kasasagi'... I am on your side."]
146: 2558| [47] [Watase]
147: 2559| [45] [(Just when we were finally getting through to each other...)]
148: 2612| [45] [But she was no more.]
149: 2617| [45] [Her sharp tongue, keen eyes, and smile... had been forever lost.]
150: 2622| [47] [Watase]
151: 2623| [45] [(Dammit...!)]
152: 2628| [47] [Watase]
153: 2629| [45] [(Dammit, dammit, dammit...!)]
154: 2634| [45] [He wanted to cry, but he didn't. He felt like Ena would scold him if he did.]
155: 2639| [45] [So Watase just cursed himself.]
156: 2644| [45] [The only tears he shed were in his heart--]
157: 2688| [45] [He'd made it to the room soon enough.]
158: 2693| [45] [He laid her on the floor there--]
159: 2698| [45] [And then quietly left.]
160: 2751| [45] [He then smashed the door's opening mechanism so no one could get in.]
161: 2756| [45] [For with no coffins in the facility, this was the only burial for her he could come up with...]
