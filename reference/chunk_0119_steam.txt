  1:   77| [47] [Watase]
  2:   80| [45] ["T-Teach!"]
  3:   85| [45] [Watase tried to follow her right away--]
  4:   90| [45] [Only to be stopped by the image of Ukita and Jun's faces, full of hostility towards him, flashing through his mind.]
  5:  247| [47] [Watase]
  6:  248| [45] [(Khh... dammit, she's right! If I go out there, all I'll do is rile them up...!)]
  7:  253| [45] [Watase decided to give up on following Ena after he thought that.]
  8:  258| [45] [However, anxiety welled up in his chest.]
  9:  263| [47] [Watase]
 10:  264| [45] [(But... will Teach really be able to persuade them all by herself?)]
 11:  269| [47] [Watase]
 12:  270| [45] [(What if they doubt her because she defended me back at the surveillance room?)]
 13:  275| [45] [But it was too late now.]
 14:  280| [47] [Watase]
 15:  281| [45] [(Teach... please get through to them...!)]
 16:  286| [45] [Watase waited for Ena to return, desperately praying for her success--]
 17:  351| [45] [--Yet as time passed, there was no sign of her.]
 18:  400| [47] [Watase]
 19:  401| [45] [(... She's late...)]
 20:  406| [47] [Watase]
 21:  407| [45] [(What's up with Teach...? She said she'd be right back...!)]
 22:  412| [47] [Watase]
 23:  413| [45] [(--Could something have happened to her!?)]
 24:  418| [47] [Watase]
 25:  419| [45] [(Don't tell me she failed to persuade them and then got...!?)]
 26:  424| [45] [That thought ignited the anxiety that had been smoldering inside of him up until now.]
 27:  580| [47] [Watase]
 28:  581| [45] [(--Dammit! I knew I never should have let Teach go alone!)]
 29:  586| [45] [Having finally reached the limits of his patience, Watase went running out of the office.]
 30:  696| [45] [There was no trace of anyone in the hallways.]
 31:  701| [45] [In fact, it was so quiet that it sent shivers down Watase's spine.]
 32:  706| [45] [He began shouting at the top of his lungs without any regard for his current plight.]
 33:  714| [47] [Watase]
 34:  717| [45] ["Teach, where are you!? Say something if you can hear me!"]
 35:  722| [45] [There was no answer.]
 36:  730| [47] [Watase]
 37:  733| [45] ["--Shit!"]
 38:  738| [45] [Watase urged himself onwards and ran down the hallway.]
 39:  890| [45] [--Area 2, outer ring, B2--]
 40:  898| [47] [Watase]
 41:  901| [45] ["Teach! Where are you!? Can you hear me!?"]
 42:  906| [45] [But there was no answer.]
 43:  911| [45] [It seemed this block too was cloaked in silence.]
 44:  916| [45] [The chills running down Watase's spine only intensified.]
 45:  924| [47] [Watase]
 46:  927| [45] ["Teach! Old man! Moribe!"]
 47:  935| [47] [Watase]
 48:  938| [45] ["Someone, anybody, please say something!"]
 49:  943| [45] [The bad feeling he had only got worse.]
 50:  948| [45] [He wanted to make sure Ena was safe as soon as possible, even if it meant getting caught.]
 51:  953| [47] [Watase]
 52:  954| [45] [(Where is she!? Where did Teach go!?)]
 53: 1003| [45] [Watase went recklessly running around LABO--]
 54: 1048| [45] [He soon found himself stopping near a connecting passageway.]
 55: 1053| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1054| [45] [(Isn't this...?)]
 57: 1059| [45] [It was the place where they'd all first met Ena.]
 58: 1064| [45] [There was a corner up ahead.]
 59: 1069| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1070| [45] [(That's right, we found Teach right after we rounded that corner...!)]
 61: 1196| [45] [It was a memory of only a few hours ago, but one that made him even more anxious for some reason.]
 62: 1201| [45] [His mouth was parched.]
 63: 1206| [45] [Watase gulped deeply, then slowly headed down the passageway.]
 64: 1268| [45] [He then peeked around the corner--]
 65: 1319| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1322| [45] ["--!"]
 67: 1327| [45] [Watase's eyes went wide.]
 68: 1332| [45] [Ena was lying on the ground right there.]
 69: 1346| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1349| [45] ["Teach!"]
 71: 1405| [45] [Watase ran over to her and frantically helped her up.]
 72: 1410| [45] [And when he did--]
 73: 1520| [45] [Ena's head dangled limply.]
 74: 1528| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1531| [45] ["... Aah..."]
 76: 1536| [45] [Her body was still warm.]
 77: 1541| [45] [Watase pressed his fingers against her neck-- No pulse. None.]
 78: 1546| [45] [He checked her pupils-- they were dilating.]
 79: 1551| [45] [He then took off his Vital Checker and wrapped it around Ena's wrist-- all five lights shone red.]
 80: 1556| [45] [There was a bullet hole gouged through her forehead that exited out at the back of her head...]
 81: 1561| [45] [There was no need to check anything else.]
 82: 1566| [45] [Ena-- was dead.]
 83: 1571| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1572| [45] ["..."]
 85: 1577| [45] [Watase found himself utterly speechless.]
 86: 1582| [45] [Before long, a sound escaped from his chest.]
 87: 1629| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1632| [45] ["... Uw... aah..."]
 89: 1640| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1643| [45] ["... Uwaaa..."]
 91: 1651| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1654| [45] ["... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
 93: 1662| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1665| [45] ["Why!? Why!?"]
 95: 1673| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1676| [45] ["Why is Teach dead!?"]
 97: 1681| [45] [There was no one there to answer his question.]
 98: 1686| [45] [Ena's now dull eyes were staring off into space.]
 99: 1694| [47] [Watase]
100: 1697| [45] ["... Why..."]
101: 1702| [47] [Watase]
102: 1703| [45] ["..."]
103: 1711| [47] [Watase]
104: 1714| [45] ["... Teach...!"]
105: 1719| [45] [Watase held Ena's body to his chest.]
106: 1724| [45] [He could feel the remaining warmth in her body slipping away little by little...]
107: 1782| [45] [...]
108: 1787| [45] [...]
109: 1792| [45] [... He lost track of the passage of time.]
110: 1797| [45] [Once the heat from Ena's body had completely vanished,]
111: 1802| [45] [Watase rose to his feet, and lifted her body in his arms.]
112: 1853| [47] [Watase]
113: 1856| [45] ["... Let's go, Teach."]
114: 1864| [47] [Watase]
115: 1867| [45] ["You'd probably hate to be left in a place like this..."]
116: 1872| [45] [Watase left the connecting passageway, carrying Ena on his back.]
117: 1877| [45] [--She had been trapped in that passageway when they'd first come across her.]
118: 1882| [45] [So he wanted to take her out of there and lay her to rest in a quiet room at the very least.]
119: 1887| [45] [The room where he'd last spoken to her.]
120: 1931| [45] [Watase kept walking as he felt her weight on his back.]
121: 1936| [45] [He didn't want to think about anything.]
122: 1941| [45] [And yet for some reason--]
123: 1946| [45] [Memories of her came rising and vanishing in his head like bubbles with each step he took.]
124: 2037| [47] [Ena]
125: 2040| [45] ["So you're the captain? You're not exactly instilling much confidence with that whole 'sorta' business."]
126: 2045| [45] [She'd told him that when they'd first met.]
127: 2123| [47] [Ena]
128: 2126| [45] ["How can you be so unprepared!? Aren't you guys supposed to be a rescue squad!?"]
129: 2131| [45] [At first, he'd thought of her only as an unpleasant woman who just complained all the time.]
130: 2174| [45] [--But before long, her attitude began to change little by little.]
131: 2251| [47] [Ena]
132: 2254| [45] ["Oh my, you're finally starting to sound like a man of your station, Captain Amnesia."]
133: 2259| [45] [She began looking at Watase in a new light after witnessing him put his life at risk time and time again.]
134: 2322| [47] [Ena]
135: 2325| [45] ["Don't be modest. You were both manly and incredible."]
136: 2330| [45] [Over time, they had gradually come to understand one another.]
137: 2408| [47] [Ena]
138: 2411| [45] ["What are you doing, Captain Kasasagi...!?"]
139: 2419| [47] [Ena]
140: 2422| [45] ["You have to get a hold of yourself."]
141: 2427| [45] [Though she would scold him at times, her words would help Watase press onwards.]
142: 2471| [45] [Trapped in this hell with Death hovering behind them...]
143: 2476| [45] [--They looked for the survivors and a way to survive together, but then--]
144: 2556| [47] [Ena]
145: 2559| [45] ["As long as you stay the way you are now... as long you're 'Captain Kasasagi'... I am on your side."]
146: 2603| [47] [Watase]
147: 2604| [45] [(Just when we were finally getting through to each other...)]
148: 2657| [45] [But she was no more.]
149: 2662| [45] [Her sharp tongue, keen eyes, and smile... had been forever lost.]
150: 2667| [47] [Watase]
151: 2668| [45] [(Dammit...!)]
152: 2673| [47] [Watase]
153: 2674| [45] [(Dammit, dammit, dammit...!)]
154: 2679| [45] [He wanted to cry, but he didn't. He felt like Ena would scold him if he did.]
155: 2684| [45] [So Watase just cursed himself.]
156: 2689| [45] [The only tears he shed were in his heart--]
157: 2733| [45] [He'd made it to the room soon enough.]
158: 2738| [45] [He laid her on the floor there--]
159: 2743| [45] [And then quietly left.]
160: 2796| [45] [He then smashed the door's opening mechanism so no one could get in.]
161: 2801| [45] [For with no coffins in the facility, this was the only burial for her he could come up with...]
