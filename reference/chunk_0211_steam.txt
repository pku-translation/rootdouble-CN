  1:   87| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   90| [45] ["You must be hungry, huh, Salyu?"]
  3:  131| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  134| [45] ["I bet. You've been hanging in there all this time, haven't you?"]
  5:  142| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  145| [45] ["Thank you, Salyu. Let me pat your head as thanks."]
  7:  231| [45] [Mashiro petted Salyu's head just as she said she would.]
  8:  236| [45] [Salyu seemed a little ticklish, but she didn't seem to hate being petted as she obediently allowed Mashiro to continue.]
  9:  244| [47] [Salyu]
 10:  247| [45] ["... I did it to protect you two. It's not like I did it for praise."]
 11:  309| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  312| [45] ["There you go again~ No need to be such a tsundere, you little cutie~"]
 13:  338| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  341| [45] ["It's not like I'm embarrassed or anything. Actually, I..."]
 15:  349| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  352| [45] ["You...?"]
 17:  375| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  376| [45] ["..."]
 19:  402| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  405| [45] ["It might be weird for me to say this, but--"]
 21:  431| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  434| [45] ["I thought today was kind of... fun."]
 23:  460| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  463| [45] ["Huh? Fun?"]
 25:  468| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro found themselves confused at the sudden mention of that word.]
 26:  473| [45] [Salyu nodded as she explained herself.]
 27:  499| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  502| [45] ["Remember when we got on the bus two days ago?"]
 29:  510| [47] [Salyu]
 30:  513| [45] ["We made a promise to go around the city."]
 31:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  524| [45] ["Oh, sure."]
 33:  550| [47] [Salyu]
 34:  553| [45] ["And we fulfilled that promise in an unexpected way."]
 35:  561| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  564| [45] ["We chased and got chased and ended up making an adventure all around town."]
 37:  590| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  593| [45] ["It was almost like I had slipped into the memories you two share."]
 39:  601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  604| [45] ["Our memories?"]
 41:  630| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  633| [45] ["Yeah, your memories."]
 43:  638| [45] [Salyu smiled and gazed at Mashiro and Natsuhiko.]
 44:  646| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  649| [45] ["... I have no memories of my own. There was nothing for me in my hometown."]
 46:  675| [47] [Salyu]
 47:  678| [45] ["My days were dark and ashen, truly lifeless times..."]
 48:  704| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  707| [45] ["But today is sure to become a good memory."]
 50:  715| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  718| [45] ["I'm glad I came to this town."]
 52:  752| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  755| [45] ["..."]
 54:  760| [45] [Natsuhiko inadvertently looked away from Salyu.]
 55:  765| [45] [He was taken completely off guard by Salyu's pure innocence.]
 56:  770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  771| [45] [(What's with this girl? She's way too honest... That's just not fair!)]
 58:  817| [45] [He looked towards Mashiro--]
 59:  822| [45] [She was pressing down on the inner corners of her eyes with trembling fingers.]
 60:  865| [47] [Mashiro]
 61:  868| [45] ["Salyu, were girls like you..."]
 62:  876| [47] [Mashiro]
 63:  879| [45] ["Were girls like you put on this earth to kill me with 'moe'!?"]
 64:  887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  890| [45] ["Um, you do know that 'moe'... is a dead word nowadays, right?"]
 66:  916| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  919| [45] ["Kill you with 'fire'?"]
 68:  945| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  948| [45] ["Not quite the right type of 'moe', but close enough."]
 70:  974| [47] [Salyu]
 71:  977| [45] ["... I don't follow."]
 72:  985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  988| [45] ["Don't worry about it. Basically she's saying you're cute, that's all."]
 74: 1014| [47] [Salyu]
 75: 1017| [45] ["I-I see."]
 76: 1022| [45] [Salyu's eyes wandered in apparent confusion.]
 77: 1048| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1051| [45] ["Anyway... What I wanted to say was that today was fun."]
 79: 1059| [47] [Salyu]
 80: 1062| [45] ["We didn't get to go shopping, but we can save that for later."]
 81: 1088| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1091| [45] ["I want us to all go together... Can we?"]
 83: 1117| [47] [Mashiro]
 84: 1120| [45] ["Of course! Let's go shopping next Sunday for sure!"]
 85: 1128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1131| [45] ["I'm up for it too."]
 87: 1157| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1160| [45] ["That's great. I'm glad you two agree."]
 89: 1168| [47] [Salyu]
 90: 1171| [45] ["To be honest, I want new clothes."]
 91: 1197| [47] [Salyu]
 92: 1200| [45] ["I really liked the clothes you picked for me, Mashiro. I want you to pick something out for me again."]
 93: 1262| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1265| [45] ["I will, I will! I'll choose howEVER many you want!"]
 95: 1273| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1276| [45] ["Is there anything else you want!? Anything!?"]
 97: 1302| [47] [Salyu]
 98: 1305| [45] ["I want... a stuffed animal."]
 99: 1313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1316| [45] ["Hmm? Alice no good?"]
101: 1342| [47] [Salyu]
102: 1345| [45] ["That's not it. I just want stuffed animals for my room besides Alice since I carry her everywhere."]
103: 1371| [47] [Salyu]
104: 1374| [45] ["And since Mashiro named Alice, I want you to name the next one, Natsuhiko."]
105: 1382| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1385| [45] ["I-I see...!"]
107: 1393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1396| [45] ["Hmm~ I'm not too confident in my naming sense, though..."]
109: 1422| [47] [Mashiro]
110: 1425| [45] ["Natsuhiko, not even you can be tactless enough to turn her down here, can you?"]
111: 1433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1436| [45] ["O-of course not. I'll come up with a name if you really want."]
113: 1462| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1465| [45] ["Okay. I'd be happy if you did. I'm sure I'll treasure that stuffed animal."]
115: 1527| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1530| [45] ["Oooohhh~! I'll buy you as many books, stuffed animals, or bombs of mass destruction as you want! Anything at all!"]
117: 1556| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1559| [45] ["I'll take care of your every need! Just leave it up to your big sis over here!"]
119: 1564| [45] [Mashiro struck her chest triumphantly.]
120: 1569| [45] [As Natsuhiko watched the two girls talk, he had a short dream of the future.]
121: 1574| [45] [--He saw Salyu looking around at all the stuffed animals she liked.]
122: 1579| [45] [He saw Mashiro enjoying herself as she showed Salyu her recommendations.]
123: 1584| [45] [He saw himself watching a short distance away.]
124: 1589| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1590| [45] [(I'm sure that'd be a fun day...)]
126: 1595| [45] [Natsuhiko secretly smiled to himself at the thought.]
127: 1600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1601| [45] [(She deserves at least that much of a reward.)]
129: 1606| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1607| [45] [(Since she's done so much for us today...)]
131: 1613| [45] [That much was certain-- but there was still one regretful thing that happened.]
132: 1627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1630| [45] ["... In the end, we couldn't stop the terrorists from blowing up the PRC like they wanted to, huh..."]
134: 1680| [47] [Mashiro]
135: 1683| [45] ["Yeah... but at least there weren't any casualties."]
