  1:   62| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at Natsuhiko's declaration.]
  2:   89| [47] [Watase]
  3:   92| [45] ["All of us survive... together?"]
  4:  100| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  103| [45] ["Yes."]
  6:  108| [45] [For six to survive, three had to stay behind--]
  7:  113| [45] [That was a premise that Natsuhiko did not want to accept.]
  8:  121| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  124| [45] ["Sacrificing some to save others...?"]
 10:  132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  135| [45] ["I'm sick and tired of that notion!"]
 12:  161| [47] [Watase]
 13:  164| [45] ["What!?"]
 14:  172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  175| [45] ["Watase, you see... I've been living nine years of peace thanks to Yuuri sacrificing her life."]
 16:  183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  186| [45] ["I've been allowed to live nine years in an illusion thanks to Mashiro's dedication."]
 18:  194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  197| [45] ["I'm truly grateful for those two, but--"]
 20:  205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  208| [45] ["Are you telling me to just accept that some people will have to be sacrificed!?"]
 22:  269| [47] [Watase]
 23:  272| [45] ["...!"]
 24:  305| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke to the others as well.]
 25:  313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  316| [45] ["Everyone else here is the same as me... We've all had our lives saved by someone else's sacrifice."]
 27:  324| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  327| [45] ["We've all lost something precious because of someone else's sacrifice."]
 29:  335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  338| [45] ["How many times must we repeat that cycle?"]
 31:  343| [47] [All]
 32:  346| [45] ["..."]
 33:  351| [45] [Everyone's faces froze at those words.]
 34:  356| [45] [Every individual in the room had lost something in that same way.]
 35:  361| [45] [However--]
 36:  401| [47] [Watase]
 37:  404| [45] ["Easier said than done! Do you have any way to actually pull that off!?"]
 38:  412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  415| [45] ["No, I don't! But I'm saying we shouldn't just give up and accept that 'some people will have to be sacrificed'!"]
 40:  442| [47] [Watase]
 41:  445| [45] ["You're running your mouth off irrationally here, dumbass!"]
 42:  471| [47] [Watase]
 43:  474| [45] ["Easier said than done! Do you have any way to actually pull that off!?"]
 44:  482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  485| [45] ["You're the dumbass, Watase!"]
 46:  493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  496| [45] ["I'm saying we shouldn't just give up and accept that 'some people will have to be sacrificed'!"]
 48:  504| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  507| [45] ["'Sacrificing yourself' is the same damn thing! Don't give up on life!"]
 50:  515| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  518| [45] ["Remember what Wataru said? Fight on until the very end!"]
 52:  544| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  547| [45] ["If you wanna give up, then you can do that later, right!?"]
 54:  608| [47] [Watase]
 55:  611| [45] ["..."]
 56:  619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  622| [45] ["It's the instinct of the human individual to try and survive regardless of the situation, right?"]
 58:  630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  633| [45] ["Then isn't it the logic of the human community to try and survive together, without sacrificing anyone!?"]
 60:  641| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  644| [45] ["Everyone here wants to live!"]
 62:  652| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  655| [45] ["So isn't it only obvious for us to try and survive as a whole!?"]
 64:  660| [45] [Even if it were an idealistic thought detached from reality...]
 65:  665| [45] [Even if it were nothing more than an impossible delusion...]
 66:  670| [45] [That was what Natsuhiko desired.]
 67:  747| [45] [--He suddenly remembered.]
 68:  752| [45] [He remembered all of the unsightly sides of humans he had seen today.]
 69:  805| [45] [Watase, whose mind had been ruled by hatred.]
 70:  855| [45] [Jun, who tried to harm others in the name of justice.]
 71:  905| [45] [Ukita, who doubted the comrades who shared his will.]
 72:  955| [45] [Ena, who opened her heart to no one.]
 73: 1005| [45] [Kazami, who tried to take the life of the one she loved under the pretext of protecting him.]
 74: 1056| [45] [--And every one of them had held dangerous weapons.]
 75: 1061| [45] [Every one of them was frightening.]
 76: 1066| [45] [And once again, everybody--]
 77: 1309| [45] [--had become unable to fully trust one another.]
 78: 1361| [45] [--Humans are terrifying.]
 79: 1366| [45] [Humans are filled with malice.]
 80: 1371| [45] [Humans are bringers of despair.]
 81: 1376| [45] [That's what he had once thought.]
 82: 1427| [45] [But beyond those sides of humans--]
 83: 1432| [45] [He had seen many beautiful, precious sides to them too.]
 84: 1484| [45] [--There, Natsuhiko saw the light.]
 85: 1534| [45] [Even in the deepest depths of despair, people were able to hold the will to survive.]
 86: 1584| [45] [People could rush to save others, even at the risk of their own lives.]
 87: 1634| [45] [Even in the darkness of doubt and malice, people could believe. People could love.]
 88: 1684| [45] [... For that itself was hope.]
 89: 1734| [45] [To find an escape route from any deadly situation, and to move on forward down that route hand in hand with those next to you.]
 90: 1784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1785| [45] [(Humans weren't meant to choose despair...)]
 92: 1835| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1836| [45] [(The side of humanity that strives with the will to survive-- That itself is hope!)]
 94: 1886| [45] [--That's what Natsuhiko had learned from everybody--]
 95: 1936| [45] [And he didn't want a single one of them to die.]
 96: 2042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 2045| [45] ["Guys, let's think things through one more time! Is there really no other way!?"]
 98: 2053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 2056| [45] ["We all strove hard to get to this point! We never gave up, did we!?"]
100: 2064| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 2067| [45] ["If any of us gave up that easily, we would've died long ago!"]
102: 2075| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 2078| [45] ["We're the ones who never gave up!"]
104: 2083| [47] [All]
105: 2086| [45] ["..."]
106: 2091| [45] [Everyone fell silent at Natsuhiko's words.]
107: 2096| [45] [Deep silence filled the control room.]
108: 2101| [45] [Eventually the silence was torn apart-- by Yuuri's voice.]
109: 2127| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 2130| [45] ["L... let's think, everyone!"]
111: 2138| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 2141| [45] ["There has to be a way waiting for us somewhere... No, even if there isn't!"]
113: 2149| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 2152| [45] ["We mustn't give up on thinking until the very end of our time limit!"]
115: 2160| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 2163| [45] ["That's how we've gotten this far, isn't it!?"]
117: 2189| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 2192| [45] ["We survived even when our path was filled with poisonous gas, even when fire chased us from behind, even in the most dire of situations, didn't we!?"]
119: 2200| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 2203| [45] ["When Captain Kasasagi and I were trapped under the rubble, you didn't abandon us, did you!?"]
121: 2211| [47] [Yuuri]
122: 2214| [45] ["I don't want to die! But I don't want to sacrifice anyone else, either!!"]
123: 2240| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2243| [45] ["Those are my true feelings!!"]
125: 2248| [45] [That was perhaps the first time Natsuhiko had heard Yuuri shout so seriously.]
126: 2253| [45] [She had always smiled quietly. She had always cowered in fear. She had always been thinking of others--]
127: 2258| [45] [It was the one and only time she acted selfish.]
128: 2291| [45] [Her will resounded in everyone's hearts.]
129: 2296| [45] [Her best friend smiled in relief.]
130: 2322| [47] [Mashiro]
131: 2325| [45] ["Yeah... You're right, Yuuri. I think so too!"]
132: 2351| [47] [Salyu]
133: 2354| [45] ["I also agree...!"]
134: 2380| [47] [Jun]
135: 2383| [45] ["Well, that sounds like the more rescue squad-like option to me!"]
136: 2409| [47] [Ukita]
137: 2412| [45] ["But in all honesty, what do we do? Make a full-power sprint in the thirty second span that the bulkheads remain open?"]
138: 2438| [47] [Ena]
139: 2441| [45] ["That's impossible! Some of us are injured, you know!?"]
140: 2467| [47] [Kazami]
141: 2470| [45] ["The only emergency stairs that go to the surface are in Area 2! We can't make it in time even if we run from here!"]
142: 2475| [45] [Time passed even as they held this discussion.]
143: 2482| [45] [A look at the watch revealed the time was "6:07 PM"-- 10 minutes until detonation.]
144: 2616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2617| [45] [(Think! Is there no other way!?)]
146: 2622| [45] [He recalled everything they had seen and heard.]
147: 2627| [45] [Natsuhiko's memories. Watase's memories.]
148: 2632| [45] [Yuuri's, Mashiro's, Salyu's, Kazami's, Jun's, Ena's, Ukita's memories--]
149: 2637| [45] [Nothing came to mind.]
150: 2644| [45] [The time was "6:08 PM"-- 9 minutes.]
151: 2649| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2650| [45] [(C'mon, don't give up! Think! There's just gotta be a way!)]
153: 2655| [45] [He recalled everything that happened today.]
154: 2709| [45] [Natsuhiko's and Watase's confrontation in Area N. How he shattered Watase's memories.]
155: 2761| [45] [And how after Watase woke up, everyone searched for a route to survival.]
156: 2813| [45] [How even when he was threatened by malice-infected people, he still tried to save everyone and sought that escape route--!]
157: 2852| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2853| [45] [(Things were crazy back then, but this time for sure...)]
159: 2858| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2859| [45] [(We'll find an escape route!)]
161: 2864| [45] [The very moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind,]
162: 2869| [45] [as if to support his will--]
163: 2928| [85] [{The pipes.}]
164: 2929| [86] [???]
165: 2930| [86] [{The pipes.}]
166: 2979| [47] [Natsuhiko & Watase]
167: 2982| [45] ["Huh...?"]
168: 2993| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened.]
169: 2998| [45] [They all stared at Watase.]
170: 3024| [47] [Kazami]
171: 3027| [45] ["C-Captain... d-did you just say something?"]
172: 3053| [47] [Yuuri]
173: 3056| [45] ["And with telepathy...?"]
174: 3061| [45] [That was indeed Watase's voice.]
175: 3066| [45] [But it somehow didn't seem to come from his voicebox.]
176: 3074| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 3077| [45] ["Watase! Don't tell me you awoke to BC too!?"]
178: 3103| [47] [Watase]
179: 3106| [45] ["N-no! It wasn't me!"]
180: 3114| [47] [Watase]
181: 3117| [45] ["I don't have any aptitude, and I wasn't even trying to use it!"]
182: 3143| [47] [Watase]
183: 3146| [45] ["I mean, it even echoed in my head, too! It couldn't have been my telepathy, could it!?"]
184: 3154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 3157| [45] ["Th-then what in the world was that--"]
186: 3240| [45] [An illusion!? An auditory hallucination!?]
187: 3245| [45] [As soon as those question's passed Natsuhiko's mind, the voice echoed once more.]
188: 3303| [85] [{Did you notice that thick pipe near the ceiling]
189: 3305| [85] [ when we went to the engine room?}]
190: 3306| [86] [Watase]
191: 3307| [86] [{Did you notice that thick pipe near the ceiling when we went to the engine room?}]
192: 3350| [47] [All]
193: 3353| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
194: 3358| [45] [It wasn't an illusion, nor an auditory hallucination.]
195: 3363| [45] [Everyone certainly heard that voice.]
196: 3368| [45] [A "something" that was neither Watase's voice nor his telepathy.]
197: 3425| [85] [{If that's just a dummy, then we can escape through there...!}]
198: 3426| [86] [Watase]
199: 3427| [86] [{If that's just a dummy, then we can escape through there...!}]
200: 3455| [45] [As the voice continued, Natsuhiko remembered.]
201: 3460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 3461| [45] [(It's from back then!)]
203: 3466| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 3467| [45] [(That's what Watase said three hours ago when he tried to escape through the drainage pipe!)]
205: 3490| [45] [Watase seemed to make the same realization, for he murmured dumbfoundedly.]
206: 3498| [47] [Watase]
207: 3501| [45] ["Wh-what... What's going on!?"]
208: 3527| [47] [Watase]
209: 3530| [45] ["Why am I just now hearing what I said in the past!?"]
210: 3556| [47] [Salyu]
211: 3559| [45] ["Could residual information energy have returned again!?"]
212: 3585| [47] [Yuuri]
213: 3588| [45] ["But Captain Kasasagi wasn't using BC back then! That phenomenon shouldn't even apply!"]
214: 3596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
215: 3599| [45] ["No--!"]
216: 3604| [45] [True. Watase wasn't using BC back then.]
217: 3609| [45] [But Natsuhiko was.]
218: 3692| [45] [He had been continuously using Senses Sympathy on Watase.]
219: 3697| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3698| [45] [(Our brains were connected via BC particles...)]
221: 3703| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3704| [45] [(Everything Watase experienced had propagated back to me.)]
223: 3709| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3710| [45] [(So in other words, that means--!)]
225: 3715| [45] [The trace information energy emitted from Watase's mind drifted through the space between him and Natsuhiko.]
226: 3720| [45] [And due to the particle amplifier, the energy was amplified and lingered there without dissipating--]
227: 3725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3726| [45] [(It's only coming back now!?)]
229: 3731| [45] [The moment he made that realization,]
230: 3797| [47] [Natsuhiko]
231: 3800| [45] ["!!"]
232: 3805| [45] [sights of the past flickered before his eyes.]
233: 3933| [47] [Watase]
234: 3936| [45] [{So this really is our only way out!}]
235: 3962| [47] [Kazami]
236: 3965| [45] [{Then that means we have three problems that we have to solve first--}]
237: 3991| [47] [Kazami]
238: 3994| [45] [{#1: How do we open a hole in the pipe?}]
239: 4138| [47] [Ena]
240: 4141| [45] [{Wha... what the hell!?}]
241: 4149| [47] [Watase]
242: 4152| [45] [{Why was there a bomb planted inside a fire extinguisher!?}]
243: 4305| [47] [Kazami]
244: 4308| [45] [{#2: How do we ensure that we can breathe inside the flooded pipe?}]
245: 4452| [47] [Jun]
246: 4455| [45] [{Find anything, Captain?}]
247: 4463| [47] [Watase]
248: 4466| [45] [{We've got a respirator set up and a transfusion kit if we ever need it, but nothing we can use right now.}]
249: 4611| [47] [Kazami]
250: 4614| [45] [{#3: How do we walk through 500 m of 53 degree Celsius water from here to Lake Rokumei...!?}]
251: 4622| [47] [Kazami]
252: 4625| [45] [{So... should we wait for the water to cool down after we stop it from running?}]
253: 4651| [47] [Watase]
254: 4654| [45] [{That'd be the best way, but it'd probably take too much time...}]
255: 4784| [47] [Kazami]
256: 4787| [45] [{--If you break the intake pipe by mistake, then all of LABO will be flooded.}]
257: 4890| [47] [Kazami]
258: 4893| [45] [{All of LABO will be flooded. Please be careful.}]
259: 4954| [45] [Those sights flowed before his eyes like a muddy stream--]
260: 5039| [45] [--and then disappeared.]
261: 5110| [47] [Natsuhiko & Watase]
262: 5113| [45] ["... What was that...!?"]
263: 5118| [45] [They exchanged glances.]
264: 5123| [45] [There was something clearly strange about that phenomenon.]
265: 5150| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 5153| [45] ["Th-that..."]
267: 5161| [47] [Yuuri]
268: 5164| [45] ["That didn't seem like a simple return of lingering information energy..."]
269: 5169| [45] [Naturally, it wasn't a simple reminiscence. It was fragmentary sights and words.]
270: 5174| [45] [But that collection of fragments seemed to hold some sort of meaning.]
271: 5182| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 5185| [45] ["Wait, could that stream of information just now... contain a way to escape!?"]
273: 5213| [47] [Watase]
274: 5216| [45] ["Think, guys! Try to find meaning in what happened just now!"]
275: 5274| [47] [All]
276: 5277| [45] ["On it!"]
277: 5288| [45] [The nine of them pondered.]
278: 5293| [45] [What was the meaning hidden within those flickering sights?]
279: 5319| [47] [Mashiro]
280: 5322| [45] ["The first thing we heard was 'the pipes', right!?"]
281: 5348| [47] [Ukita]
282: 5351| [45] ["Then should we really try to escape through there after all!?"]
283: 5377| [47] [Kazami]
284: 5380| [45] ["But we failed when we tried three hours ago, didn't we!?"]
285: 5406| [47] [Ena]
286: 5409| [45] ["Then what should we do!?"]
287: 5435| [47] [Jun]
288: 5438| [45] ["How to open a hole, a way to breathe, hot water, intake pipe..."]
289: 5464| [47] [Salyu]
290: 5467| [45] ["There's a way to escape hidden in this information..."]
291: 5475| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 5478| [45] ["And that way is...!?"]
293: 5483| [45] [It was just a mess of ambiguous, fragmentary information.]
294: 5532| [45] [But indeed, hidden within--]
295: 5537| [45] [There was an answer.]
296: 5552| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 5555| [45] ["Aah...!"]
298: 5603| [45] [Natsuhiko abruptly gasped.]
299: 5608| [45] [And at the same time, everyone's eyes widened.]
300: 5620| [47] [All]
301: 5623| [45] ["Th... that's it!"]
302: 5628| [45] [It seemed everyone reached the answer at the same time.]
303: 5636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 5639| [45] ["... I see... So that's the way!"]
305: 5644| [45] [They found the one, final route remaining--]
306: 5649| [45] [A route where everyone's survival was possible.]
307: 5661| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 5662| [45] [(That's it...! That's it, that's it, that's it! That has to be it!!)]
309: 5674| [45] [His heartbeat sped up.]
310: 5686| [45] [His temples went numb.]
311: 5691| [45] [The hope they finally found at the last moment--]
312: 5696| [45] [They exchanged glances and shouted it.]
313: 5705| [47] [Natsuhiko]
314: 5708| [45] ["--Okay, everyone! This is the plan!"]
315: 5741| [47] [Watase]
316: 5744| [45] ["First, we hack into Brain Cell and get six of us out of here!"]
317: 5786| [47] [Yuuri & Mashiro]
318: 5789| [45] ["Yes!"]
319: 5831| [47] [Kazami]
320: 5834| [45] ["Then the three left behind will escape from the 'designated location'!"]
321: 5882| [47] [Jun & Salyu]
322: 5885| [45] ["Roger!"]
323: 5928| [47] [Ena]
324: 5931| [45] ["Understood!"]
325: 5973| [47] [Ukita]
326: 5976| [45] ["All right!"]
327: 6059| [45] [--Everyone understood, without anyone having to say the particulars.]
328: 6064| [45] [At that moment, nine minds became one in perfect unison.]
329: 6090| [47] [Kazami]
330: 6093| [45] ["But that still means three people have to stay behind!"]
331: 6119| [47] [Jun]
332: 6122| [45] ["Who'd be the best to stay behind!?"]
333: 6180| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, and Watase all answered at the same time.]
334: 6221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
335: 6224| [45] ["We'll stay behind!"]
336: 6250| [47] [Yuuri]
337: 6253| [45] ["Security Sector 6 have their eye on me and Hikorin! It'd actually be more dangerous for us to try and escape now!"]
338: 6261| [47] [Watase]
339: 6264| [45] ["Yeah! After you six escape, I'll take responsibility for Natsuhiko and Yuuri and get them out of here safely!"]
340: 6322| [45] [The six nodded to the three's proposal.]
341: 6348| [47] [Salyu]
342: 6351| [45] ["Then once the bulkheads open, we'll evacuate to a safe place!"]
343: 6377| [47] [Jun]
344: 6380| [45] ["If we board a rescue chopper, we can escape the security department's clutches altogether!"]
345: 6406| [47] [Ukita]
346: 6409| [45] ["Then after we escape, we'll go pick you three up! Let's reunite outside!"]
347: 6435| [47] [Ena]
348: 6438| [45] ["Then once all nine of us are back together, let's migrate to the ESP Bureau headquarters! They can't pursue us there!"]
349: 6443| [45] [The plan fell into place all at once.]
350: 6551| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu looked at the Natsuhiko and Yuuri and spoke.]
351: 6577| [47] [Mashiro]
352: 6580| [45] ["I'm worried, but... this is the only way, isn't it?"]
353: 6606| [47] [Salyu]
354: 6609| [45] ["It's tough even with that in mind..."]
355: 6617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
356: 6620| [45] ["It's okay, it's okay."]
357: 6646| [47] [Yuuri]
358: 6649| [45] ["Mashiron, Salyu... We'll meet again outside for sure."]
359: 6675| [47] [Mashiro]
360: 6678| [45] ["... Promise?"]
361: 6761| [45] [And then Kazami and the others spoke to Watase.]
362: 6787| [47] [Kazami]
363: 6790| [45] ["Captain, take care of those two for me."]
364: 6816| [47] [Jun]
365: 6819| [45] ["Hang in there, Captain. I know you can do it."]
366: 6845| [47] [Ena]
367: 6848| [45] ["I won't forgive you if you die or allow either of the other two to die, okay?"]
368: 6874| [47] [Ukita]
369: 6877| [45] ["I might not be in any position to say this, but... I'm counting on you, Captain Kasasagi."]
370: 6903| [47] [Watase]
371: 6906| [45] ["Yeah, I know..."]
372: 6932| [47] [Watase]
373: 6935| [45] ["That's my duty, after all."]
374: 7068| [45] [There was no need for any other words.]
375: 7073| [45] [This was not a final farewell.]
376: 7078| [45] [Everyone believed they'd live to see each other again.]
377: 7086| [47] [Natsuhiko]
378: 7089| [45] ["There's no more time... Let's begin, everyone!"]
379: 7115| [47] [Watase]
380: 7118| [45] ["In one minute, we'll hack into Brain Cell and open up the bulkheads!"]
381: 7144| [47] [Yuuri]
382: 7147| [45] ["So please wait by the bulkheads and escape as soon as they open, okay!?"]
383: 7298| [47] [All 6]
384: 7301| [45] ["YEAH!"]
385: 7306| [45] [And with those words, everyone raised their voices in unison.]
