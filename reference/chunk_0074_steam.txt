  1:  106| [47] [Jun]
  2:  109| [45] ["What do you mean, my back was inj... agh! Ow!!"]
  3:  114| [45] [Jun's body writhed in agony. It seemed she'd just noticed her own wound.]
  4:  122| [47] [Watase]
  5:  125| [45] ["So well, you see... I'm sorry, but you'll have to remove your clothes so I can seal up the wound."]
  6:  151| [47] [Jun]
  7:  154| [45] ["... Oh, well in that case... guess we've got no other choice then."]
  8:  162| [47] [Jun]
  9:  165| [45] ["But don't be surprised about what you see, okay?"]
 10:  170| [45] [Jun said that in a defeated voice, turned her back to Watase--]
 11:  175| [45] [And unzipped her uniform.]
 12:  224| [45] [Jun didn't hesitate for a moment as she removed her uniform, then took off her bloodstained T-shirt.]
 13:  229| [45] [Her back was now exposed.]
 14:  345| [45] [Watase had thought she was short-statured, but only now did it hit him just how small her body was.]
 15:  350| [45] [There was a wound about 2 cm wide bleeding below her right shoulder-blade.]
 16:  355| [45] [But that wasn't what caught Watase's eye.]
 17:  363| [47] [Watase]
 18:  366| [45] ["...!"]
 19:  371| [45] [There was a wide scar that looked like badly inflamed skin that spanned from her right shoulder to about halfway down her back.]
 20:  376| [47] [Watase]
 21:  377| [45] [(Is this... a burn scar?)]
 22:  382| [45] [It was clear that she hadn't gotten it recently, but rather a long time ago.]
 23:  390| [47] [Jun]
 24:  393| [45] ["Captain, hurry up."]
 25:  401| [47] [Watase]
 26:  404| [45] ["R-right..."]
 27:  449| [45] [Watase quickly spread the Chiron on Jun's wound at her urging.]
 28:  457| [47] [Jun]
 29:  460| [45] ["..."]
 30:  465| [45] [Jun's body twitched as if she were being tickled.]
 31:  473| [47] [Watase]
 32:  476| [45] ["Sorry Moribe, but put up with it for a while."]
 33:  481| [45] [Watase said that and continued treating her.]
 34:  486| [45] [Jun's wound finally closed up after Watase had used half the tube on it.]
 35:  494| [47] [Watase]
 36:  497| [45] ["... Done."]
 37:  542| [45] [Jun let the tension out of her shoulders when she heard that.]
 38:  547| [45] [Her back was sweaty, dyeing the burn scar a pale crimson.]
 39:  595| [47] [Jun]
 40:  598| [45] ["... Does it bother you?"]
 41:  606| [47] [Watase]
 42:  609| [45] ["Ah, no... sorry..."]
 43:  617| [47] [Jun]
 44:  620| [45] ["No, don't worry about it. I'm letting you see it because it's you."]
 45:  625| [45] [There was a faint hint of expectation in her words.]
 46:  630| [45] [Watase decided to take her up on that and satisfy his curiosity.]
 47:  638| [47] [Watase]
 48:  641| [45] ["Say... how'd you get that burn scar? It's pretty obvious you've had it for quite a while."]
 49:  689| [47] [Jun]
 50:  692| [45] ["I got it in a gas explosion accident ten years ago..."]
 51:  700| [47] [Watase]
 52:  703| [45] ["A 'gas explosion accident'...?"]
 53:  708| [45] [Watase was taken aback.]
 54:  713| [45] [That's right, Kazami's little sister had died in a--!]
 55:  721| [47] [Watase]
 56:  724| [45] ["Moribe, don't tell me you were there when it happened!"]
 57:  729| [45] [Jun quietly began talking.]
 58:  737| [47] [Jun]
 59:  740| [45] ["... Yeah. I went to visit Nagisa at her apartment that day."]
 60:  748| [47] [Jun]
 61:  751| [45] ["The two of us were just playing around, when all of a sudden we heard this noise so loud that it felt like my ears were gonna burst--"]
 62:  759| [47] [Jun]
 63:  762| [45] ["By the time I came to my senses, we were trapped under rubble."]
 64:  770| [47] [Jun]
 65:  773| [45] ["We couldn't move around, and no one came to help no matter how much we cried for it..."]
 66:  778| [45] [--So that burn scar was probably from then.]
 67:  783| [45] [Jun continued in an awfully low voice.]
 68:  791| [47] [Jun]
 69:  794| [45] ["Eventually, help did come, and Nagisa and I were saved..."]
 70:  802| [47] [Jun]
 71:  805| [45] ["But Nagisa'd been hit on the head... and she passed away two days later."]
 72:  813| [47] [Watase]
 73:  816| [45] ["I see... so that's what..."]
 74:  821| [45] [Watase let his voice trail off as he remained unsure of what to do.]
 75:  826| [45] [Jun continued without a hint of sorrow in her voice.]
 76:  874| [47] [Jun]
 77:  877| [45] ["... I loved Nagisa, you know."]
 78:  885| [47] [Jun]
 79:  888| [45] ["She was so pure-hearted, kind, and considerate..."]
 80:  896| [47] [Jun]
 81:  899| [45] ["I always felt like she was my salvation whenever I was with her."]
 82:  907| [47] [Jun]
 83:  910| [45] ["So when that accident happened, I wanted to do whatever I could to save her... but I was totally powerless back then..."]
 84:  915| [45] [Jun gritted her teeth in resentment toward her past self.]
 85:  920| [45] [Watase understood everything when he saw that look on her face.]
 86:  928| [47] [Watase]
 87:  931| [45] ["So that's why you became a rescue worker...?"]
 88:  936| [45] [With that small body of hers, Jun was not suited to be a rescue worker in any definition of the term.]
 89:  941| [45] [And yet here she was.]
 90:  946| [45] [How much had she put herself through to make her body fit enough to become a rescue worker?]
 91:  951| [45] [Watase felt true admiration for that ironclad conviction of hers.]
 92:  959| [47] [Watase]
 93:  962| [45] ["... So you entered this line of work for the same reasons as Tachibana, huh?"]
 94:  970| [47] [Jun]
 95:  973| [45] ["Yeah... well, there's more to it than just that, but yeah, it was the biggest reason."]
 96:  981| [47] [Jun]
 97:  984| [45] ["I don't want a repeat of that day ever again. I don't want my powerlessness to stop me from helping someone close to me, not when they're suffering right before my eyes."]
 98:  992| [47] [Jun]
 99:  995| [45] ["This burn scar is a symbol of that time in my life where I was weak."]
100: 1003| [47] [Jun]
101: 1006| [45] ["So I thought I'd never show it to anyone except someone I completely trust..."]
102: 1054| [47] [Jun]
103: 1057| [45] ["But I never thought that someone would be you of all people. Funny, huh?"]
104: 1062| [45] [Jun gave him an awkward smile.]
105: 1067| [45] [Watase understood painfully well just how significant this scar was to Jun.]
106: 1072| [45] [So he also forced a smile and answered her.]
107: 1080| [47] [Watase]
108: 1083| [45] ["No, I don't deserve that right. Not after I let you get hurt like that."]
109: 1091| [47] [Jun]
110: 1094| [45] ["What're you talking about? We're buddies, so a few scratches here and there mean nothing, right?"]
111: 1102| [47] [Watase]
112: 1105| [45] ["... Buddies, huh?"]
113: 1110| [45] [That was right. Watase remembered the promise they'd made just before they ran into that contaminated zone--]
114: 1115| [45] [He and Jun were partners who held a mutual trust in each other.]
115: 1123| [47] [Watase]
116: 1126| [45] ["... I'm surprised you're calling me that. I mean, I've just been an unreliable greenhorn who let his squadmate get hurt."]
117: 1134| [47] [Jun]
118: 1137| [45] ["You're not unreliable. If you were, then I wouldn't have shown you this scar that I've never let anyone else see."]
119: 1145| [47] [Jun]
120: 1148| [45] ["... I did it because I have high hopes in you."]
121: 1156| [47] [Jun]
122: 1159| [45] ["So please... please don't do anything to betray my hopes, you hear?"]
123: 1167| [47] [Watase]
124: 1170| [45] ["Yeah, you can bet on that."]
125: 1178| [47] [Jun]
126: 1181| [45] ["Absolutely positively?"]
127: 1189| [47] [Watase]
128: 1192| [45] ["I keep my promises."]
129: 1200| [47] [Watase]
130: 1203| [45] ["I'll keep living up to the trust you've put in me... as your buddy."]
131: 1208| [45] [Jun then gave him a tender smile.]
132: 1216| [47] [Jun]
133: 1219| [45] ["... Thanks, Captain. You really are a whole lot different today, you know that?"]
134: 1227| [47] [Watase]
135: 1230| [45] ["Well, I'm only half as efficient and persuasive as I normally am, but bear with me."]
136: 1238| [47] [Jun]
137: 1241| [45] ["No, that's not what I mean."]
138: 1249| [47] [Jun]
139: 1252| [45] ["I mean that you're much kinder and gentler than normal."]
140: 1260| [47] [Watase]
141: 1263| [45] ["Huh...?"]
142: 1268| [45] [Watase's heart leapt at those words.]
143: 1273| [45] [A small blush crossed Jun's face.]
144: 1321| [47] [Jun]
145: 1324| [45] ["Hey... maybe you'll get mad at me for saying something like this right now..."]
146: 1332| [47] [Jun]
147: 1335| [45] ["But I like the you of today."]
148: 1343| [47] [Jun]
149: 1346| [45] ["Much more than I do the normal you..."]
150: 1351| [45] [Watase gulped loudly.]
151: 1356| [45] [To receive such honest affection from a girl twelve years younger than him-- there was no way he wasn't happy about that.]
152: 1361| [45] [But any more than that left him at a loss.]
153: 1369| [47] [Watase]
154: 1372| [45] ["Wh... what are you talking about? I'm 32 years old. I'm an old fart compared to you, you know?"]
155: 1380| [47] [Watase]
156: 1383| [45] ["I'm sure there's someone much more suitable for a young girl like you--"]
157: 1391| [47] [Jun]
158: 1394| [45] ["You dummy, that's not what I meant. I meant that I'm happy to be teamed up with you as your buddy."]
159: 1402| [47] [Watase]
160: 1405| [45] ["Ph-phew... don't startle me like that."]
161: 1453| [47] [Jun]
162: 1456| [45] ["Ohhhh? Why so flustered?"]
163: 1464| [47] [Jun]
164: 1467| [45] ["Did looking at my bare skin fill your head with dirty thoughts? Is that why you interpreted what I said that way?"]
165: 1475| [47] [Watase]
166: 1478| [45] ["Hey, I'm still a guy. I can't help it, right?"]
167: 1483| [45] [Watase and Jun shared a laugh.]
168: 1488| [45] [Laughs filled with such peaceful emotions that almost didn't match the life-or-death situation they were stuck in--]
169: 1531| [45] [With her treatment completed, Jun put her clothes back on.]
170: 1593| [47] [Jun]
171: 1596| [45] ["... Honestly, I wish you could stay this way forever..."]
172: 1604| [47] [Watase]
173: 1607| [45] ["Huh? But I'm me. That fact will never change."]
174: 1633| [47] [Jun]
175: 1636| [45] ["Well, yeah, but... it's just..."]
176: 1644| [47] [Jun]
177: 1647| [45] ["I worry that once you get your memories back, the you I'm looking at right now will be gone forever..."]
178: 1655| [47] [Watase]
179: 1658| [45] ["...!"]
180: 1663| [45] [--The words Jun blurted out held an ominous ring to Watase.]
181: 1668| [45] [But he quickly shook it off.]
182: 1676| [47] [Watase]
183: 1679| [45] ["... Don't talk nonsense. I'll never go away."]
184: 1687| [47] [Watase]
185: 1690| [45] ["Not without your permission, that is..."]
186: 1716| [47] [Jun]
187: 1719| [45] ["Yeah... I'd appreciate that."]
188: 1724| [45] [Watase gave Jun a reassuring nod to drive away her fears.]
189: 1729| [45] [They then looked at the time to find that they'd been in this room for quite a while.]
190: 1737| [47] [Watase]
191: 1740| [45] ["Oh crap... this isn't good, old man Ukita went on ahead to keep on searching."]
192: 1766| [47] [Jun]
193: 1769| [45] ["Huh? By himself?"]
194: 1777| [47] [Watase]
195: 1780| [45] ["We promised that we'd meet up in Area 2. I need to get a move on fast."]
196: 1806| [47] [Jun]
197: 1809| [45] ["Then I'll come with--"]
198: 1841| [45] [Jun then tried to stand up, but she staggered on her feet.]
199: 1849| [47] [Watase]
200: 1852| [45] ["No, you just got hit on the head. Just rest here for the time being."]
201: 1860| [47] [Watase]
202: 1863| [45] ["I'm heading in the direction of Area 2. Catch up to me once you recover."]
203: 1889| [47] [Jun]
204: 1892| [45] ["Mmm... okay, I'll do what you say."]
205: 1900| [47] [Watase]
206: 1903| [45] ["Yeah, see you later."]
207: 1908| [45] [Watase waved to Jun and left the laboratory.]
208: 1957| [45] [He ran over to Area 2 as fast as he could to make up for the lost time he'd spent treating Jun.]
