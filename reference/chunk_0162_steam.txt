  1:   18| [45] [As they sipped some after-dinner coffee, Natsuhiko and the girls sighed contentedly.]
  2:  176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  179| [45] ["Ahh... that was delicious..."]
  4:  187| [47] [Yuuri]
  5:  190| [45] ["Mm~... My tummy's so full..."]
  6:  232| [47] [Salyu]
  7:  235| [45] ["... I saw the vastness of space."]
  8:  240| [45] [Even Salyu spoke incomprehensibly as her eyes drooped.]
  9:  266| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  269| [45] ["That's great~ I made a lot of dishes I've never made before, so I was a little worried."]
 11:  295| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  298| [45] ["'I learned by imitation, but it turned out great!'"]
 13:  321| [45] [Mashiro tensed her voice as she spoke, causing Salyu to tilt her head in confusion.]
 14:  347| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  350| [45] ["Mashiro, sometimes you seem to change the way you talk... Was that supposed to be a male voice?"]
 16:  376| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  379| [45] ["Ugh, you called me out so calmly. That's kinda embarrassing, you know...?"]
 18:  384| [45] [Natsuhiko thought that if it really were that embarrassing, she should've just not said it at all. Regardless, he joined in the conversation.]
 19:  392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  395| [45] ["Ah, don't mind that. Mashiro just has this habit of quoting lines from manga and anime."]
 21:  421| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  424| [45] ["Man, I'm so ashamed. But I can't help it because I love that stuff."]
 23:  500| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  503| [45] ["What about you, Salyu? I've heard that manga and anime are popular in France."]
 25:  581| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  584| [45] ["True. So what about you, Salyu?"]
 27:  610| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  613| [45] ["Huh?"]
 29:  621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  624| [45] ["Do you have any interest in manga or anime?"]
 31:  647| [45] [They asked even though it didn't look likely. Salyu thought for a second before answering.]
 32:  673| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  676| [45] ["I haven't watched or read either, but... I do read novels."]
 34:  702| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  705| [45] ["Ah, that's right. You were even reading a book in the classroom, right? What kinds of novels do you like?"]
 36:  731| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  734| [45] ["Sci-fi."]
 38:  760| [47] [Mashiro]
 39:  763| [45] ["Sigh fidelity?"]
 40:  771| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  774| [45] ["Science fiction. I particularly like the ones from the last century."]
 42:  800| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  803| [45] ["Huh... didn't think you were into that kinda thing."]
 44:  811| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  814| [45] ["Ah, I've read some of those too~ Just the juvenile-ish ones, though."]
 46:  840| [47] [Salyu]
 47:  843| [45] ["Like the ones by 'Alice'?"]
 48:  869| [47] [Mashiro]
 49:  872| [45] ["Yeah, she's just about the only author I can talk about."]
 50:  877| [45] [Mashiro grinned, and after a short second or two, Salyu smiled back.]
 51:  903| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  906| [45] ["... You say interesting things."]
 53:  914| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  917| [45] ["Hmm? What's that supposed to mean?"]
 55:  943| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  946| [45] ["It's fun to talk about things you like with other people who like the same thing. Right, Salyu?"]
 57:  972| [47] [Salyu]
 58:  975| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 59:  983| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  986| [45] ["Mmgh, I feel a little left out..."]
 61:  991| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled despite his complaint.]
 62: 1033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1036| [45] ["Oh right, Yuuri, are there any sci-fi novels you'd recommend?"]
 64: 1062| [47] [Yuuri]
 65: 1065| [45] ["Hmm, I don't read that much sci-fi, but... there is one book that I've read several times."]
 66: 1179| [47] [Mashiro]
 67: 1182| [45] ["What's that~?"]
 68: 1258| [47] [Yuuri]
 69: 1261| [45] ["It was a story about 'telepaths' written before the Grand Communicator Discovery."]
 70: 1269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1272| [45] ["Oh, I know about that one too."]
 72: 1350| [47] [Mashiro]
 73: 1353| [45] ["Me too!"]
 74: 1358| [45] [It was a novel written more than half a century ago that still somewhat managed to predict today's society after the appearance of Communicators.]
 75: 1363| [45] [Its foresight and detail gave it a second wind in popularity such that almost all kids in Natsuhiko's generation had read it at least once.]
 76: 1389| [47] [Mashiro]
 77: 1392| [45] ["Did you know about it, Salyu? It's a Japanese sci-fi novel--"]
 78: 1415| [45] [Salyu nodded when Mashiro told her the title.]
 79: 1423| [47] [Salyu]
 80: 1426| [45] ["Of course I know that one. The last chapter was very beautiful."]
 81: 1466| [47] [Yuuri]
 82: 1469| [45] ["Speaking of the last chapter, it had a famous quote, didn't it?"]
 83: 1495| [47] [Yuuri]
 84: 1498| [45] ["'-- Lord in heaven, why did you create us telepaths?'"]
 85: 1594| [45] [After Yuuri quoted the book in a theatrical tone of voice, Mashiro eventually smiled and took over from where she left off.]
 86: 1620| [47] [Mashiro]
 87: 1623| [45] ["'Was it meant as a test for humans and for telepaths, to see if we could reach an understanding?'"]
 88: 1663| [45] [And after a short pause, Salyu contributed.]
 89: 1689| [47] [Salyu]
 90: 1692| [45] ["'If that is the case, O Lord...'"]
 91: 1715| [45] [And finally, Natsuhiko concluded--]
 92: 1723| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1726| [45] ["'Then we have failed you.'"]
 94: 1765| [45] [And as they took turns reciting such sad lines-- they all smiled at each other. ]
 95: 1773| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1776| [45] ["Hahah... Looks like we finally found a topic we all have in common, huh?"]
 97: 1802| [47] [Mashiro]
 98: 1805| [45] ["We really got into it, huh. It all just seemed to click."]
 99: 1831| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1834| [45] ["... We managed to get a reaction out of that."]
101: 1912| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1915| [45] ["I guess unlike the quote, we 'succeeded' in understanding each other, huh?"]
103: 1993| [45] [Even Yuuri and Salyu seemed to share in the harmonious conversation.]
104: 2016| [45] [Mashiro sighed in relief to see that.]
105: 2021| [45] [Mashiro seemed like she was trying to mediate Salyu's relationship with not just Natsuhiko, but with Yuuri too. Natsuhiko also tried to help a bit.]
106: 2029| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 2032| [45] ["Yuuri really likes books. I'm sure she's got tons of recommendations for you if you want to try something besides sci-fi... so what do you think?"]
108: 2058| [47] [Salyu]
109: 2061| [45] ["Mm, sounds interesting."]
110: 2137| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 2140| [45] ["Then I'll choose a recommendation and lend it to you, okay?"]
112: 2254| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 2257| [45] ["In that case, since we're doing recommendations and all, maybe I should try a sci-fi novel? What do you recommend?"]
114: 2283| [47] [Salyu]
115: 2286| [45] ["I don't know if you'd find them interesting, but--"]
116: 2291| [45] [Salyu listed several of her favorite authors and titles.]
117: 2317| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 2320| [45] ["Okay, I'll try to read some of that. You read some too, Natsuhiko!"]
119: 2328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2331| [45] ["Huh? Why me too?"]
121: 2357| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 2360| [45] ["Think of it as a way to understand Salyu. If you know what someone likes, you'll know what's on their minds."]
123: 2436| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2439| [45] ["Is that a quote?"]
125: 2517| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 2520| [45] ["Nah, that's just my mantra. I've got several recommendations too, so I'll bring those over to this house for now."]
127: 2546| [47] [Salyu]
128: 2549| [45] ["So if I finish those, I'll understand what's on your mind, Mashiro?"]
129: 2575| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 2578| [45] ["Of course, of course. Like my favorite anime, 'Beyond*BEYOND'--"]
131: 2583| [45] [Salyu listened intently to Mashiro's otaku talk.]
132: 2658| [45] [Yuuri smiled as she listened in.]
133: 2709| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2710| [45] [(... That's good. Looks like things are going along swimmingly.)]
135: 2715| [45] [--He was expecting conflict, but instead, he got a friendly atmosphere filling the room.]
136: 2720| [45] [It looked like his worries about Yuuri's emotional scars were unnecessary, just like Mashiro said.]
137: 2832| [45] [In stark contrast to yesterday, today felt quite comfortable.]
138: 2837| [45] [It was the strange euphoric feeling he had felt earlier when they were coming home from shopping, but--]
139: 2842| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 2843| [45] [(... Ah...)]
141: 2947| [45] [That's when Natsuhiko finally realized the true form of that feeling.]
142: 2952| [45] [Buying ingredients, going home, sharing a delicious dinner, and having a fun conversation afterwards.]
143: 2957| [45] [Those were all things a "family" did.]
144: 2962| [45] [Those were things the Tenkawa household had lost long ago, when his father had passed away and his mother became too busy to leave work.]
145: 2967| [45] [Natsuhiko felt like those things had returned.]
146: 3179| [45] [Perhaps all they needed was the addition of a younger child like Salyu.]
147: 3184| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 3185| [45] [(... Hahah.)]
149: 3381| [45] [If you looked at the bigger picture, it almost looked like they were playing house.]
150: 3386| [45] [But Natsuhiko began to feel comfortable with that nonetheless.]
151: 3391| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 3392| [45] [(I'm so selfish, aren't I...)]
153: 3409| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled bitterly at his own change in mentality as he joined in on the conversation.]
