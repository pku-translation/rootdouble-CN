  0:   65| [45] [--It had happened about a week ago--]
  1:   70| [45] [Kazami had been working hard as always.]
  2:   75| [45] [There had been no dispatches recently, leaving her life in relative peace for the time being.]
  3:   80| [45] [But she decided to spend her breaks between work testing how much her skills had grown.]
  4:   85| [45] [Naturally, her training had taught her all sorts of different things she needed for her job.]
  5:   90| [45] [Such as knowledge of things required to become a certified practitioner in various fields.]
  6:   95| [45] [Or knowledge about poisons, hazardous substances, explosives, etc.]
  7:  100| [45] [And of course-- knowledge about past accidents and disasters-- an essential part of disaster prevention.]
  8:  135| [45] [Looking into the inspection records of past accidents and disasters had become a sort of hobby for Kazami.]
  9:  141| [45] [She would have one of her juniors, a fire inspector, send her those reports, which she would then read during her breaks between training.]
 10:  146| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  147| [45] [(This information really is handy for knowing how to handle a crisis...)]
 12:  152| [45] [Jun had called it a "dark hobby", but their job involved putting their lives on the line anyway. There was nothing dark about it.]
 13:  157| [45] [But regardless of whether or not she was actually doing it to improve her efficiency at work, there was something she'd been investigating for a long time.]
 14:  162| [45] [--It was the record of the "Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex Gas Explosion Accident".]
 15:  167| [45] [It was that horrific tragedy that had robbed Nagisa of her life and given Jun that scar on her back... It was only natural Kazami was obsessed with the incident.]
 16:  178| [45] [Just then, Kazami's PDA beeped.]
 17:  183| [45] [She checked its screen to find the name of the fire inspector displayed alongside the "e-mail received" icon.]
 18:  188| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  189| [45] [(More reports on past accidents...?)]
 20:  201| [45] [Kazami opened the e-mail as she thought that.]
 21:  285| [45] [Subject: Regarding the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex Gas Explosion Accident (7)]
 22:  289| [85] [　]
 23:  292| [45] [Sender: Reina Asukai]
 24:  296| [85] [　]
 25:  299| [45] [Body:]
 26:  303| [85] [　]
 27:  306| [45] [Ms. Kazami Tachibana,]
 28:  310| [85] [　]
 29:  313| [45] [Thank you for all your hard work. This is Fire Inspector Asukai of the Rokumei City Fire Department.]
 30:  317| [45] [To continue where we left off the other day, I have a report on the investigation of that accident.]
 31:  321| [85] [　]
 32:  324| [45] [The following is what I have been able to confirm at this time:]
 33:  328| [85] [ %N]
 34:  331| [45] [#1: Cause of the damage done to floors 1-6 on the east side of the complex:]
 35:  335| [85] [　]
 36:  338| [45] [There were likely multiple causes.]
 37:  342| [85] [　]
 38:  345| [45] [The first conceivable reason is that the building had aged, and wasn't sturdy enough.]
 39:  349| [85] [　]
 40:  352| [45] [The Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex was built before Rokumei became a government designated top-secret city.]
 41:  355| [45] [So it was an old building.]
 42:  359| [45] [To be exact, the accident occurred 44 years after its construction.%NIt was only barely within its legal service life.]
 43:  363| [85] [ %N]
 44:  367| [45] [Furthermore, the concrete used in the building was lacking in rebars and contained excess water.]
 45:  371| [45] [There were clear signs that the building's contractors cut corners during construction.]
 46:  375| [85] [　]
 47:  378| [45] [Thus, it is quite possible that the building's already unsteady structure could not withstand the vibrations caused by the gas explosion,]
 48:  381| [45] [causing it to partially collapse on itself.]
 49:  385| [85] [ %N]
 50:  388| [45] [#2: Regarding the cause of the gas explosion that was powerful enough to shake the entire eastern side of the apartment complex.]
 51:  392| [85] [　]
 52:  395| [45] [There weren't that many documents pertaining to this matter back then,]
 53:  398| [45] [so it took a little time to look into.]
 54:  402| [85] [　]
 55:  405| [45] [But what I can say first is that "there wasn't just one explosion".]
 56:  409| [85] [　]
 57:  412| [45] [The first explosion most likely occurred in a dwelling unit on the eastern side of the first floor.]
 58:  416| [45] [The resulting explosive flames broke through the wall and reached the dwelling units on both sides of the building.]
 59:  420| [85] [　]
 60:  423| [45] [At the same time, they also broke through the ceilings and reached the dwelling units on the upper floor.]
 61:  427| [45] [As such, a total of four dwelling units were hit by those flames.]
 62:  431| [85] [ %N]
 63:  434| [45] [One of them caused the second gas explosion.]
 64:  437| [85] [　]
 65:  440| [45] [This set off a chain reaction leading to even more small explosions.]
 66:  444| [45] [In conclusion, this chain reaction is believed to have been what caused such a wide-scale explosion.]
 67:  447| [45] [(Multiple residents who lived next door to the complex also testified that they heard multiple explosions.)]
 68:  451| [85] [ %N]
 69:  454| [45] [#3: Regarding the lack of documents from that time.]
 70:  458| [85] [　]
 71:  461| [45] [I apologize. I don't know why either.]
 72:  465| [85] [　]
 73:  468| [45] [There were supposedly multiple fire inspectors already working in Rokumei City at the time...]
 74:  472| [45] [Yet there is strikingly little reliable documentation.]
 75:  476| [85] [　]
 76:  479| [45] [I believe the negligence of those fire inspectors is to blame.]
 77:  483| [45] [I am truly ashamed of this matter...]
 78:  487| [85] [ %N]
 79:  490| [45] [That is all I have regarding this inspection report.]
 80:  494| [85] [　]
 81:  497| [45] [Also... I have an unfortunate piece of news.]
 82:  501| [45] [It appears that I am being transferred on short notice.]
 83:  505| [85] [　]
 84:  508| [45] [My commander just informed me the other day without any warning.]
 85:  512| [85] [　]
 86:  515| [45] [Once I transfer,]
 87:  518| [45] [I will no longer be able to continue my duties as a fire inspector...]
 88:  522| [85] [　]
 89:  525| [45] [So at the very least, I do not believe I will be allowed to keep on assisting you with this investigation.]
 90:  529| [45] [With that said, I leave the rest to you.]
 91:  607| [47] [Kazami]
 92:  608| [45] ["..."]
 93:  613| [45] [Kazami frowned once she finished reading the e-mail.]
 94:  618| [45] [She first sent a reply thanking Reina, then she contemplated the e-mail's contents.]
 95:  623| [47] [Kazami]
 96:  624| [45] [(Multiple explosions...? Can those really happen so quickly after one another?)]
 97:  629| [45] [If it really had been caused by a chained explosion, then that would make it one of the worst apartment complex gas explosion accidents in Japanese history.]
 98:  634| [45] [Which meant that it should have been be a prime target for disaster prevention study.]
 99:  639| [45] [Yet this incident had gone largely ignored by firefighting organizations all over the country.]
100:  644| [45] [Almost like they were trying to let a sleeping dog lie--]
101:  649| [47] [Kazami]
102:  650| [45] [(... Another thing to wonder about is the lack of documentation surrounding the incident.)]
103:  655| [47] [Kazami]
104:  656| [45] [(What if the documentation wasn't actually lacking--)]
105:  661| [47] [Kazami]
106:  662| [45] [(But rather concealed?)]
107:  667| [45] [When she pondered why anyone would do that-- Kazami suddenly remembered something from long ago.]
108:  672| [47] [Kazami]
109:  673| [45] [(Now that I think about it, Nagisa told me something interesting about the apartment a while back...)]
110:  758| [47] [Nagisa]
111:  761| [45] ["--Hey Sis, about this apartment..."]
112:  769| [47] [Nagisa]
113:  772| [45] ["It might be a special apartment where they gather Communicators."]
114:  777| [47] [Kazami]
115:  780| [45] ["Oh, what makes you think that?"]
116:  806| [47] [Nagisa]
117:  809| [45] ["Well, the lady next door said she was allowed to live in this apartment because her son's a Communicator."]
118:  817| [47] [Nagisa]
119:  820| [45] ["She also said, 'families with Communicators are given an advantage in the drawing of lots for renting vacant rooms'."]
120:  825| [47] [Kazami]
121:  828| [45] ["Oh... I see."]
122:  833| [45] [Kazami understood what that information had meant even back then.]
123:  838| [45] [The apartment complex was an old building, meaning there were many rooms and that the rent was next to nothing.]
124:  843| [45] [It was a popular property, yet Kazami and Nagisa had been able to move in without waiting for their lot to be drawn.]
125:  848| [45] [Kazami had thought they had been given favorable treatment since they were orphans--]
126:  853| [45] [But it appeared it had been because they were Communicators instead.]
127:  858| [45] [Such a policy was unique to Rokumei City.]
128:  949| [45] [--In other words, there was a large possibility that there had been a lot of Communicators living in that apartment.]
129:  954| [45] [And then an explosion had occurred at such an important piece of property. Even in the event that the accident had been the complex manager's fault...]
130:  959| [47] [Kazami]
131:  960| [45] [(Then it's possible the cause of the accident was covered-up too...?)]
132:  965| [45] [It was a rather offbeat theory, but one that couldn't be completely ruled out.]
133:  970| [47] [Kazami]
134:  973| [45] ["The Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex... perhaps I should investigate that accident myself..."]
135:  978| [45] [Just then, someone called out to Kazami.]
136: 1004| [47] [Watase]
137: 1007| [45] ["Hey, Tachibana, what're you staring off into space for?"]
138: 1033| [47] [Watase]
139: 1036| [45] ["Did you finish up those documents I gave you yesterday?"]
140: 1041| [47] [Kazami]
141: 1044| [45] ["Ah... y-yes. I have."]
142: 1070| [47] [Watase]
143: 1073| [45] ["I see. Then put them on my desk."]
144: 1078| [45] [Watase said that, then turned around.]
145: 1083| [47] [Kazami]
146: 1086| [45] ["Ah, where are you going, Captain?"]
147: 1112| [47] [Watase]
148: 1115| [45] ["It's my shift. I'm heading back."]
149: 1166| [45] [Watase went into the station with that curt reply.]
150: 1171| [47] [Kazami]
151: 1172| [45] ["..."]
152: 1177| [45] [Kazami watched him walk off with a feeling of gloom in her heart.]
153: 1182| [45] [Watase had grown cold over the last year. Almost like he was a totally different person.]
154: 1187| [45] [What's more, he'd seemed very tense over the past few days.]
155: 1192| [45] [Kazami had tried to get him to talk about whatever was on his mind multiple times--]
156: 1197| [45] [But he rejected her efforts at every turn.]
157: 1202| [47] [Kazami]
158: 1203| [45] [(... Why won't Watase say anything?)]
159: 1208| [45] [There was too much Kazami didn't know.]
160: 1213| [45] [Such as Watase's thoughts, and the cause of the accident nine years ago.]
161: 1218| [45] [Or what she should do, or why she was so obsessed with this incident.]
162: 1223| [45] [But she felt as if vaguely sinister black clouds were hanging over all of them...]
