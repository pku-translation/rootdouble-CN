  1:  116| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped and looked back.]
  2:  121| [45] [There was a single man walking on the other side of the street.]
  3:  126| [45] [He was covering his face with a jacket hood and sunglasses even though it was nighttime.]
  4:  134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  137| [45] ["--Mashiro, Salyu. That man...!"]
  6:  142| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu looked at the man after Natsuhiko whispered to them.]
  7:  147| [45] [The man was tall, and they could tell he was quite muscular even through his jacket.]
  8:  152| [45] [There was a strange intensity about him as well.]
  9:  194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  197| [45] ["Is that the man who was on the bus...?"]
 11:  205| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  208| [45] ["M-Maybe... At least he looks like he has the same build."]
 13:  234| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  237| [45] ["He's coming this way...!"]
 15:  296| [45] [The man walked straight towards them, never looking to either side. ]
 16:  301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  302| [45] [(What if he's a terrorist--!?)]
 18:  307| [45] [The fact that he was approaching without hiding or running away probably meant that he had business with them.]
 19:  312| [45] [The fact that he wasn't on guard meant--]
 20:  317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  318| [45] [(He could be armed...)]
 22:  323| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  324| [45] [(Don't tell me he's here to silence us...!?)]
 24:  329| [45] [Natsuhiko promptly put himself on guard.]
 25:  335| [45] [If the man wasn't a terrorist, he'd just walk past them.]
 26:  340| [45] [The man stopped about 50 m away from the kids, but then--]
 27:  351| [45] [--he suddenly made a mad dash at them.]
 28:  416| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  419| [45] ["!!"]
 30:  427| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  430| [45] ["Mashiro, Salyu, let's get out of here!"]
 32:  456| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  459| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
 34:  464| [45] [Natsuhiko turned back and tried to run.]
 35:  469| [45] [--But on the other side of the road was just a single straight path continuing on forever.]
 36:  474| [45] [It was not a distance he could run while taking Mashiro with him.]
 37:  482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  485| [45] ["This way! Turn to the side road!"]
 39:  490| [45] [In a daze, Natsuhiko dragged Mashiro and Salyu into the side road.]
 40:  544| [45] [They ran down the unpaved road.]
 41:  549| [45] [They could tell the man was following them.]
 42:  554| [45] [They made a desperate run for their life in the darkness with nary a streetlight.]
 43:  562| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  565| [45] ["...!"]
 45:  570| [45] [Soon enough, Natsuhiko realized something: this street was familiar.]
 46:  575| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  576| [45] [(This path leads to--!)]
 48:  581| [45] [That's right. It should lead to the ruined factory.]
 49:  586| [45] [He didn't know if taking refuge in those ruins would be a blessing or a curse.]
 50:  591| [45] [But he knew that if they kept running, their chances of escaping were low.]
 51:  599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  602| [45] ["This way, guys!"]
 53:  607| [45] [Natsuhiko shouted and rushed into the ruined factory.]
 54:  660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  663| [45] ["Haah, haah...!"]
 56:  696| [47] [Mashiro]
 57:  699| [45] ["Whew...!"]
 58:  732| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  735| [45] ["...!"]
 60:  740| [45] [They tried to catch their breath as quietly as they could.]
 61:  776| [45] [And with stealthy steps, they hid under cover.]
 62:  781| [45] [As they held their breath, they heard Mashiro using telepathy.]
 63:  856| [85] [{... You think we'll be okay if we hide here...?}]
 64:  857| [86] [Mashiro]
 65:  858| [86] [{... You think we'll be okay if we hide here...?}]
 66:  886| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu answered her in a whisper.]
 67:  894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  897| [45] ["... I don't know. Hopefully he overlooks this ruined factory and passes it by..."]
 69:  923| [47] [Salyu]
 70:  926| [45] ["We can't be optimistic. If he does come here--"]
 71:  952| [47] [Salyu]
 72:  955| [45] ["I'll stall him with a surprise attack."]
 73:  960| [45] [Mashiro quietly gasped at those words.]
 74: 1035| [85] [{A surprise attack? You're gonna attack that huge a man?}]
 75: 1036| [86] [Mashiro]
 76: 1037| [86] [{A surprise attack? You're gonna attack that huge a man?}]
 77: 1068| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1071| [45] ["There should be no problem as long as he doesn't have any hand-to-hand combat skills."]
 79: 1097| [47] [Salyu]
 80: 1100| [45] ["Even if he is trained in hand-to-hand combat or he's armed, I'll be able to manage if I take him by surprise."]
 81: 1108| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1111| [45] ["... Will you really be okay?"]
 83: 1137| [47] [Salyu]
 84: 1140| [45] ["I will... as long as he's alone, that is."]
 85: 1145| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1146| [45] [(Then what if he's not alone!?)]
 87: 1157| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, he heard footsteps outside the factory.]
 88: 1183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1186| [45] ["!"]
 90: 1191| [45] [Natsuhiko shrunk down and held his breath.]
 91: 1196| [45] [The footsteps slowly came into the factory.]
 92: 1201| [45] [The number of footsteps revealed--]
 93: 1206| [45] [--that he was alone.]
 94: 1281| [85] [{He seems to be alone... Can you manage?}]
 95: 1282| [86] [Mashiro]
 96: 1283| [86] [{He seems to be alone... Can you manage?}]
 97: 1329| [45] [Salyu silently nodded.]
 98: 1386| [85] [{Should we help?}]
 99: 1387| [86] [Mashiro]
100: 1388| [86] [{Should we help?}]
101: 1434| [45] [Salyu silently shook her head.]
102: 1509| [85] [{You can do it by yourself...?}]
103: 1510| [86] [Mashiro]
104: 1511| [86] [{You can do it by yourself...?}]
105: 1557| [45] [Salyu nodded and smiled. As if to tell Mashiro to relax.]
106: 1586| [45] [... The footsteps drew closer.]
107: 1591| [45] [So close they could almost feel the man's breath.]
108: 1596| [45] [Salyu slowly calculated her timing--]
109: 1625| [45] [--and jumped out of her cover.]
110: 1673| [47] [Man]
111: 1676| [45] ["!?"]
112: 1895| [45] [Salyu's shadow danced in the darkness.]
113: 1900| [45] [They could hear the man gasp.]
114: 1918| [47] [Salyu]
115: 1921| [45] ["Shah!!"]
116: 1926| [45] [Salyu moved faster than the man could ready himself--]
117: 1997| [45] [--and landed a roundhouse kick solidly on his head.]
118: 2142| [47] [Man]
119: 2145| [45] ["...!"]
120: 2150| [45] [The man silently fell to the floor.]
121: 2158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 2161| [45] ["Y-you did it!"]
123: 2169| [47] [Mashiro]
124: 2172| [45] ["Amazing! Way to go, Salyu!"]
125: 2177| [45] [Salyu looked away, as if embarrassed by Natsuhiko and Mashiro's praise.]
126: 2185| [47] [Salyu]
127: 2188| [45] ["... More importantly, who is this man?"]
128: 2196| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 2199| [45] ["Judging by the circumstances, he seems like a terrorist, but..."]
130: 2207| [47] [Salyu]
131: 2210| [45] ["Should we wait until he wakes up and ask him?"]
132: 2218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2221| [45] ["No... that seems too dangerous."]
134: 2229| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2232| [45] ["Mashiro, can you read his mind with empathy?"]
136: 2240| [47] [Mashiro]
137: 2243| [45] ["Hmm, I don't know... I've never tried reading the mind of an unconscious person before."]
138: 2251| [47] [Mashiro]
139: 2254| [45] ["But I'll try it out."]
140: 2262| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2265| [45] ["Yeah, I'll try too."]
142: 2270| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro put their fingers to their brows.]
143: 2275| [45] [They concentrated their consciousnesses on the fainted man and focused deeply on the desire to read his mind.]
144: 2280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2281| [45] [(Tell me... Who are you?)]
146: 2286| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2287| [45] [(Are you really a terrorist!?)]
148: 2292| [45] [He focused on that question with all his heart. All his mind.]
149: 2298| [45] [He deepened his concentration and eventually his five senses faded.]
150: 2413| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 2414| [45] [(... Yes, that's the sensation... I've activated empathy!)]
152: 2419| [45] [The moment he made that realization, his lost senses were replaced--]
153: 2424| [45] [With the sound of a bizarre voice.]
154: 2638| [85] [{--...--...h ...--... u--...---}]
155: 2639| [86] [Man]
156: 2640| [86] [{--...--...h ...--... u--...---}]
157: 2668| [45] [But the voice was nothing but the unintelligible vestiges of thought.]
158: 2725| [85] [{...--...--.. i--...--..--}]
159: 2726| [86] [Man]
160: 2727| [86] [{...--...--.. i--...--..--}]
161: 2755| [45] [He only heard fragments of noise.]
162: 2760| [45] [No matter how carefully he searched, the result was the same.]
163: 2765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2766| [45] [(Dammit, I can't figure out anything like this...)]
165: 2771| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2772| [45] [(I guess it really doesn't work, huh? Can't exactly "open your heart" if you're conked out.)]
167: 2890| [45] [Natsuhiko stopped concentrating and spoke to Mashiro.]
168: 2898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2901| [45] ["Mashiro, how's it going on--"]
170: 2906| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped before he could finish.]
171: 2911| [45] [Mashiro was standing stock still with her eyes peeled wide open.]
172: 2952| [47] [Mashiro]
173: 2955| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko...!"]
174: 2963| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 2966| [45] ["!?"]
176: 2971| [45] [He gasped and traced Mashiro's gaze--]
177: 3103| [45] [--only to see two unfamiliar men suddenly standing there in the darkness.]
178: 3111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 3114| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
180: 3119| [45] [Only then did Natsuhiko notice.]
181: 3165| [45] [That Salyu was collapsed at the men's feet.]
182: 3210| [45] [And that the man on the left was holding a gun.]
183: 3215| [45] [There was no room for doubt-- In no uncertain terms, these men were terrorists.]
184: 3260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 3261| [45] [(Dammit, so he really did have allies...!)]
186: 3266| [45] [Natsuhiko cursed his carelessness.]
187: 3271| [45] [Once Natsuhiko tried to use BC, his five senses died out.]
188: 3276| [45] [In other words, he became oblivious to what was going on around him.]
189: 3281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 3282| [45] [(Did these new guys come in from the back and knock Salyu out...!?)]
191: 3287| [45] [It seemed she was only unconscious, judging by the lack of blood.]
192: 3292| [45] [But now that Salyu, the only one among them with combat skills, was incapacitated--%Nthey had no means of a counteroffensive.]
193: 3300| [47] [Mashiro]
194: 3303| [45] ["S-Salyu..."]
195: 3308| [45] [Mashiro muttered Salyu's name in a trembling voice and tried to walk up to her,]
196: 3313| [47] [Man 2]
197: 3316| [45] ["Don't move."]
198: 3321| [45] [but that voice stopped her.]
199: 3326| [47] [Man 2]
200: 3329| [45] ["The second you move, I shoot."]
201: 3337| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 3340| [45] ["...!"]
203: 3345| [45] [Natsuhiko stood to cover for Mashiro.]
204: 3350| [45] [Upon which, the third man spoke.]
205: 3358| [47] [Man 3]
206: 3361| [45] ["Natsuhiko Tenkawa and Mashiro Toba, I presume?"]
207: 3369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 3372| [45] ["...!"]
209: 3380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
210: 3383| [45] ["How do you know our names...!?"]
211: 3391| [47] [Man 3]
212: 3394| [45] ["We had someone look into it. We heard we had a couple of kids trying to sniff out our plan, see."]
213: 3402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3405| [45] ["...!"]
215: 3410| [45] [A cold chill ran down Natsuhiko's spine.]
216: 3415| [45] [He had never expected to be apprehended by the enemy so easily.]
217: 3420| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 3421| [45] [(Are these guys... an even huger organization than we thought...!?)]
219: 3426| [45] [The man continued as Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for words.]
220: 3434| [47] [Man 3]
221: 3437| [45] ["... Self-righteousness just leads to self-destruction."]
222: 3445| [47] [Man 3]
223: 3448| [45] ["Sorry, but we have to dispose of you."]
224: 3456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 3459| [45] ["Y... you're gonna kill us?"]
226: 3464| [45] [The other man answered the question quite briefly.]
227: 3469| [47] [Man 2]
228: 3472| [45] ["Yeah, we will."]
229: 3480| [47] [Mashiro]
230: 3483| [45] ["Eep...!"]
231: 3491| [47] [Man 3]
232: 3494| [45] ["Wait, it'll be too conspicuous if we leave bodies behind."]
233: 3499| [47] [Man 2]
234: 3502| [45] ["But even so, we can't leave any insecurities in our plan before it hatches, can we?"]
235: 3510| [47] [Man 3]
236: 3513| [45] ["Of course not, so in that case--"]
237: 3521| [47] [Man 3]
238: 3524| [45] ["Let's just put you kids to sleep for now."]
239: 3563| [45] [Not one second after the man finished talking, he ran over to Mashiro.]
240: 3612| [45] [And swiftly hit her in the neck with a knifehand strike.]
241: 3670| [47] [Mashiro]
242: 3673| [45] ["Aah...!"]
243: 3693| [45] [Mashiro gasped before collapsing on the spot.]
244: 3701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 3704| [45] ["Wh-what are you doing!?"]
246: 3712| [47] [Man 3]
247: 3715| [45] ["I said I'm putting you kids to sleep, didn't I?"]
248: 3723| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 3726| [45] ["How... how dare you! How dare you lay a hand on Mashiro!"]
250: 3791| [45] [Natsuhiko gave into his anger and tried to strike the man.]
251: 3796| [45] [But the man dodged all too easily and wrapped around behind him.]
252: 3822| [45] [And the very next moment, the man wrapped his thick arm around Natsuhiko's neck.]
253: 3830| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 3833| [45] ["Guh... ghah...!"]
255: 3838| [45] [Natsuhiko's breathing stopped. The man wrung out every last bit of air from his lungs.]
256: 3846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3849| [45] ["Damn... it..."]
258: 3857| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3860| [45] ["Let... go...!"]
260: 3865| [45] [But all the strength in Natsuhiko's body was not enough to make the man budge one bit.]
261: 3870| [45] [The grip in the man's arm was enough to show Natsuhiko the hopeless difference in strength between them.]
262: 3880| [45] [His consciousness started to fade into the distance.]
263: 3885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 3886| [45] [(D-dammit...!)]
265: 3891| [47] [Natsuhiko]
266: 3892| [45] [(Is this where it ends...!?)]
267: 3897| [45] [There was nothing more that Natsuhiko could do.]
268: 3902| [45] [As soon as he understood the extent of his own powerlessness, fury burst up from inside of him.]
269: 3907| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 3908| [45] [(At the very least...)]
271: 3913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 3914| [45] [(Let me at least know what exactly these guys are plotting...!)]
273: 3919| [45] [He screamed from the depths of his mind not to let things end this way.]
274: 3924| [45] [A torrent of rage surged from inside Natsuhiko.]
275: 3929| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 3930| [45] [(Let me use empathy, or anything at all!)]
277: 3935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
278: 3936| [45] [(Show me what's in their minds--!)]
279: 3941| [45] [--As that thought crossed his mind--]
280: 4054| [45] [Natsuhiko's vision blacked out.]
281: 4212| [45] [And a bizarre vision arose from the back of his mind.]
282: 4217| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 4218| [45] [(!?)]
284: 4276| [45] [He saw an unfamiliar room.]
285: 4281| [45] [He heard someone's voice from right beside him.]
286: 4364| [47] [???]
287: 4367| [45] ["--Silence them, huh?"]
288: 4372| [45] [And then he heard someone else answer.]
289: 4380| [47] [???]
290: 4383| [45] ["Not like we've got a choice..."]
291: 4391| [47] [???]
292: 4394| [45] ["You're telling us... to kill children?"]
293: 4402| [47] [???]
294: 4405| [45] ["Don't go that far. Just threaten them and tie them up."]
295: 4413| [47] [???]
296: 4416| [45] ["The security department's mobilizing too. We don't want to draw their attention and we can't have LABO increasing their own level of security either."]
297: 4424| [47] [???]
298: 4427| [45] ["Because D-day is tomorrow--"]
299: 4432| [45] [Right as Natsuhiko heard up to that point, the voices quickly faded away--]
300: 4533| [45] [And the vision disappeared too.]
301: 4580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
302: 4581| [45] [(Wha...!)]
303: 4586| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
304: 4591| [45] [What just happened? He had a feeling it was a little different from empathy.]
305: 4596| [45] [But one thing was for certain.]
306: 4601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
307: 4602| [45] [(So their real target... was LABO after all...!)]
308: 4607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
309: 4608| [45] [(And D-day is tomorrow...!?)]
310: 4613| [47] [Natsuhiko]
311: 4614| [45] [(S...to...p...)]
312: 4733| [45] [But Natsuhiko's consciousness faded away before he could tell anyone anything.]
313: 4738| [45] [His sight sank into darkness and his hearing fell silent too.]
314: 4743| [45] [And yet, for some reason--]
315: 4754| [45] [He heard the painfully loud ticking of a watch's second hand.]
316: 4759| [45] [And mixed in with that sound, he heard a faint voice.]
317: 4969| [85] [{... rin}]
318: 4970| [86] [Yuuri]
319: 4971| [86] [{... rin}]
320: 4999| [45] [It was Yuuri's voice.]
321: 5004| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 5005| [45] [(... Yuuri?)]
323: 5010| [45] [She sounded somehow sad.]
324: 5067| [85] [{... Hikorin, you've finally reached it, haven't you?}]
325: 5068| [86] [Yuuri]
326: 5069| [86] [{... Hikorin, you've finally reached it, haven't you?}]
327: 5097| [47] [Natsuhiko]
328: 5098| [45] [(Huh?)]
329: 5155| [85] [{The apex of a Communicator's journey...}]
330: 5156| [86] [Yuuri]
331: 5157| [86] [{The apex of a Communicator's journey...}]
332: 5172| [85] [{The ability beyond empathy. The power to connect minds rather than just brains.}]
333: 5173| [86] [Yuuri]
334: 5174| [86] [{The ability beyond empathy. The power to connect minds rather than just brains.}]
335: 5227| [85] [{But it would be best if you didn't use it anymore...]
336: 5229| [85] [For you might end up knowing something you'd rather not know.}]
337: 5230| [86] [Yuuri]
338: 5231| [86] [{But it would be for the best if you didn't use it anymore... For you might end up knowing something you'd rather not know.}]
339: 5259| [47] [Natsuhiko]
340: 5260| [45] [(No way... Like hell there's something I'd rather not know!)]
341: 5265| [45] [Natsuhiko shouted voicelessly.]
342: 5270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
343: 5271| [45] [(I learned what their goal was! Our conjecture was right!)]
344: 5276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
345: 5277| [45] [(So we have to do something!)]
346: 5282| [45] [But by the time he made that realization, it was too late. Natsuhiko's consciousness was blanking out.]
347: 5287| [45] [A short silence passed-- and then Yuuri seemed just a little bit happy.]
348: 5380| [85] [{... I see. Of course you'd think that way, Hikorin...}]
349: 5381| [86] [Yuuri]
350: 5382| [86] [{... I see. Of course you'd think that way, Hikorin...}]
351: 5433| [85] [{In that case, you mustn't give up...}]
352: 5434| [86] [Yuuri]
353: 5435| [86] [{In that case, you mustn't give up...}]
354: 5450| [85] [{For the truth is already right before you.}]
355: 5451| [86] [Yuuri]
356: 5452| [86] [{For the truth is already right before you.}]
357: 5467| [85] [{I'm sure you can reach it, Hikorin.}]
358: 5468| [86] [Yuuri]
359: 5469| [86] [{I'm sure you can reach it, Hikorin.}]
360: 5561| [45] [That voice faded into the distance.]
361: 5567| [45] [Eventually even the sound of the watch's second hand faded out--]
362: 5572| [45] [And ceased.]
