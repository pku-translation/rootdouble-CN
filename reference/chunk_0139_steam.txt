  1:   21| [45] [--Eventually, dinner came to a close.]
  2:   26| [45] [And after a little time spent chatting, it was time for Mashiro to go home.]
  3:  112| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  115| [45] ["Well, Natsuhiko, Yuuri, see you tomorrow."]
  5:  120| [45] [She made her usual farewell.]
  6:  146| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  149| [45] ["Thanks for today again, Mashiron."]
  8:  157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  160| [45] ["I should walk you home at least once in a while, shouldn't I?"]
 10:  186| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  189| [45] ["Nah, it's fine, it's fine. We're right in the same neighborhood, anyway."]
 12:  215| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  218| [45] ["Okay, good night, you two~"]
 14:  257| [45] [Mashiro returned their words with a smile as she left the house.]
 15:  280| [45] [--Once Mashiro left, there wasn't much for them to do.]
 16:  285| [45] [They basically just relaxed until nighttime came.]
 17:  293| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  296| [45] ["All right... I guess I'll go take a shower."]
 19:  322| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  325| [45] ["Okay, go ahead~"]
 21:  330| [45] [Yuuri would apparently take her baths during the daytime in consideration for Natsuhiko.]
 22:  338| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  341| [45] ["Okay, then if you'll excuse me."]
 24:  346| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko headed to the bathroom.]
 25:  465| [45] [After a simple shower--]
 26:  477| [45] [He brushed his teeth and went back to the living room...]
 27:  599| [45] [And Yuuri was there reading a book, waiting for him.]
 28:  625| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  628| [45] ["Ah, welcome back, Hikorin~"]
 30:  636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  639| [45] ["I'm back."]
 32:  665| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  668| [45] ["Hikorin, want to go sleep already? Or are you up for a little chat?"]
 34:  676| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  679| [45] ["A chat sounds good. Guess I'll go warm up some hot milk then."]
 36:  705| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  708| [45] ["Ah, I'll have some too~"]
 38:  716| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  719| [45] ["Roger."]
 40:  770| [45] [Natsuhiko answered affirmatively and headed to the kitchen.]
 41:  775| [45] [Both Natsuhiko and Yuuri loved hot milk.]
 42:  780| [45] [Natsuhiko warmed up hot milk for two and returned to the living room.]
 43:  855| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  858| [45] ["Here you go."]
 45:  884| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  887| [45] ["Thanks~"]
 47:  908| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri sat on the sofas surrounding the table.]
 48:  916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  919| [45] ["How'd you spend your day today, Yuuri?"]
 50:  945| [47] [Yuuri]
 51:  948| [45] ["Well, I did a little knitting."]
 52:  953| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Natsuhiko remembered that Yuuri had started knitting this summer.]
 53:  958| [45] [To make presents for Natsuhiko and Mashiro, apparently.]
 54:  966| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  969| [45] ["Oh, how's that going?"]
 56:  995| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  998| [45] ["I dunno... hopefully I'll be done by winter."]
 58: 1006| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1009| [45] ["Hahah, I'll look forward to it, then."]
 60: 1035| [47] [Yuuri]
 61: 1038| [45] ["Mmm... I'll work hard to meet your expectations."]
 62: 1043| [45] [Yuuri smiled upon hearing Natsuhiko's reply.]
 63: 1048| [45] [Natsuhiko enjoyed spending time having a quiet conversation with Yuuri after Mashiro went home.]
 64: 1074| [47] [Yuuri]
 65: 1077| [45] ["Oh, also, I read two books today, and I got started on the third."]
 66: 1085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1088| [45] ["Oh, what kind of books?"]
 68: 1114| [47] [Yuuri]
 69: 1117| [45] ["The first one was by a South American author... a wondrous tale following a certain family from prosperity to downfall."]
 70: 1125| [47] [Yuuri]
 71: 1128| [45] ["The second one was an anthology focused on the theme of dreams. One story was about a man who waited for a hundred years after a woman died."]
 72: 1136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1139| [45] ["I see, so the keywords were stuff like 'dreams' and 'illusions', huh."]
 74: 1165| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1168| [45] ["Or perhaps even 'solitude' and 'promises', maybe?"]
 76: 1173| [45] [Yuuri was quite the bookworm. She wasn't picky about genres either. She made sure to read at least one book a day, regardless of genre.]
 77: 1178| [45] [And at the end of the day, she'd give Natsuhiko her impressions.]
 78: 1204| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1207| [45] ["Incidentally, the woman had this wonderful line."]
 80: 1233| [47] [Yuuri]
 81: 1236| [45] ["'Will you gather the falling fragments of the stars and place them on my grave?'"]
 82: 1244| [47] [Yuuri]
 83: 1247| [45] ["'And will you wait for me there in 100 years? Do so, and I'm sure we will meet again."]
 84: 1255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1258| [45] ["Hmm, now that's just crazy talk."]
 86: 1330| [47] [Yuuri]
 87: 1333| [45] ["But in reply, the man said, without any hesitation, that he would wait for her. And he really did wait for her, alone, for 100 years."]
 88: 1341| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1344| [45] ["Huh? Now that's commitment... were they lovers?"]
 90: 1370| [47] [Yuuri]
 91: 1373| [45] ["Nope~ Just two people who made a promise."]
 92: 1399| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1402| [45] ["And still, the woman kept her promise and reunited with the man."]
 94: 1410| [47] [Yuuri]
 95: 1413| [45] ["In the form of a flower, under the twinkling stars of the same night sky they shared 100 years prior~"]
 96: 1429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1432| [45] ["Wow... that's a beautiful story."]
 98: 1458| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1461| [45] ["I know. Isn't it romantic?"]
100: 1487| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1490| [45] ["So what about you, Hikorin? Do you think you could keep a promise for 100 years?"]
102: 1498| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1501| [45] ["Hmm, well, I don't know if I could promise to wait that long without any hesitation, but..."]
104: 1509| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1512| [45] ["A promise is a promise, so I'm sure I'd keep it."]
106: 1538| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1541| [45] ["Exactly. You don't break promises, do you, Hikorin?"]
108: 1549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1552| [45] ["Yeah, that's my only good point, after all."]
110: 1563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1566| [45] ["Wow... that's quite a heroic story."]
112: 1592| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 1595| [45] ["But it's a beautiful story too, don't you think?"]
114: 1603| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1606| [45] ["Yeah, indeed."]
116: 1611| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri smiled at each other.]
117: 1662| [45] [--To read books and do some knitting. Such was Yuuri's daily life.]
118: 1667| [45] [She didn't go to school, nor work... nor even a step outside the house.]
119: 1672| [45] [And it was Natsuhiko's responsibility to protect that daily life.]
120: 1678| [45] [--There were circumstances behind why Yuuri never left the house.]
121: 1683| [45] [It all revolved around a certain incident that occurred nine years ago.]
122: 1823| [45] [... Back in those days, Yuuri was still a laid back girl, but she was far more active.]
123: 1922| [45] [Natsuhiko would take Yuuri and Mashiro along on exploration adventures to various places.]
124: 2019| [45] [But one day, as a result of his own actions--]
125: 2024| [45] [Natsuhiko exposed Yuuri to a life and death situation.]
126: 2120| [47] [Burned into Natsuhiko's memory was a fire.]
127: 2221| [47] [A resounding alarm, and a flickering red light.]
128: 2241| [47] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri, trapped.]
129: 2297| [47] [Yuuri's crying voice--]
130: 2438| [45] [Just remembering gave him the chills.]
131: 2443| [45] [Natsuhiko constantly regretted his actions for these past nine years.]
132: 2448| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2449| [45] [(I mustn't ever do that again...)]
134: 2454| [45] [Natsuhiko was still emotionally scarred.]
135: 2503| [45] [But Yuuri's scars were probably far deeper than his.]
136: 2604| [45] [Unfortunately, her parents passed away in a traffic accident... leaving her without a single relative.]
137: 2609| [45] [Natsuhiko's mother took custody of Yuuri out of compassion, but--]
138: 2614| [45] [By that time, the repeated tragedies had already taken their toll on the young girl's heart.]
139: 2720| [45] [Ever since that day, Yuuri was extremely afraid of going outside and shut herself up in the house.]
140: 2725| [45] [Nobody could convince her to go outside, not even by force.]
141: 2812| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2815| [45] ["H-hey, Yuuri... why not try going outside?"]
143: 2841| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 2844| [45] ["N... No...!!"]
145: 2849| [45] [Three days after she had begun to live in the Tenkawa residence.]
146: 2854| [45] [Natsuhiko steeled himself and tried to talk to her out of concern that she'd never leave the house.]
147: 2862| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2865| [45] ["What do you mean 'no'? You have to go out sometime, don't you?"]
149: 2891| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 2894| [45] ["No... it's scary...!"]
151: 2902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2905| [45] ["You're going to skip school and stay inside here forever?"]
153: 2913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2916| [45] ["C'mon, I'll stick with you through the whole thing--"]
155: 2999| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko tried to pull her by the hand,]
156: 3025| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 3028| [45] ["Noooooo! No! Noooo!"]
158: 3033| [45] [Yuuri burst into tears.]
159: 3059| [47] [Yuuri]
160: 3062| [45] ["I don't want to go outside! I hate it! I don't wanna go!!"]
161: 3070| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 3073| [45] ["Don't make me leave! Let me stay here!!"]
163: 3113| [45] [Yuuri cowered in fear as she cried.]
164: 3121| [47] [Yuuri]
165: 3124| [45] ["*sob*... *sob*... *sob*...!"]
166: 3132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 3135| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...!"]
168: 3178| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 3181| [45] ["!"]
170: 3186| [45] [Yuuri twitched when Natsuhiko tried to lend her a helping hand.]
171: 3191| [45] [She froze still as a rock-- and then all he heard from her was heavy breathing.]
172: 3196| [45] [Natsuhiko could do nothing but stand there at a loss for what to do...]
173: 3354| [45] [--Day after day after day, nothing changed.]
174: 3366| [45] [She would cry, she would suffer migraines, she'd have difficulty breathing--%Nher fear of the outside was so strong that it resulted in physiological issues.]
175: 3417| [45] [A year later, Natsuhiko gave up trying to make Yuuri go outside entirely.]
176: 3422| [45] [He was afraid. Afraid he'd break Yuuri's heart.]
177: 3427| [45] [And, without Yuuri ever going outside again...]
178: 3562| [45] [Eight more years passed.]
179: 3568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 3569| [45] [(PTSD, huh...)]
181: 3621| [45] [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-- a psychological condition stemming from extreme situations like life and death experiences.]
182: 3626| [45] [Yuuri still suffered from PTSD today.]
183: 3631| [45] [Her symptoms included flashbacks or nightmares about her past experience.]
184: 3636| [45] [She tended to avoid the things that served as the sources of her trauma.]
185: 3641| [45] [A panic disorder also accompanied these symptoms-- it was classic PTSD.]
186: 3646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 3647| [45] [(I changed her...)]
188: 3652| [45] [Yuuri merely lived a quiet life within these walls without ever leaving the house.]
189: 3657| [45] [It hurt Natsuhiko's heart to think about her situation.]
190: 3662| [45] [But Yuuri was keenly aware that it distressed him, and so she would always look at him with a compassionate look on her face.]
191: 3720| [47] [Yuuri]
192: 3723| [45] ["... What's wrong, Hikorin? You got quiet all of a sudden..."]
193: 3749| [47] [Yuuri]
194: 3752| [45] ["Are you thinking about the past again?"]
195: 3760| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 3763| [45] ["Huh...?"]
197: 3789| [47] [Yuuri]
198: 3792| [45] ["There's nothing you have to worry about."]
199: 3800| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 3803| [45] ["I get to live here now... and you're so kind to me, too."]
201: 3829| [47] [Yuuri]
202: 3832| [45] ["I've got you, and I've got Mashiron too. Every day is fun. So you really don't need to worry about me."]
203: 3837| [45] [Yuuri spoke with a gentle smile.]
204: 3842| [45] [A very clear, and somehow, ephemeral smile.]
205: 3893| [45] [--Indeed.]
206: 3898| [45] [Despite her fragile heart, she was perfectly willing to let Natsuhiko stay by her side.]
207: 3903| [45] [And so in turn, Natsuhiko vowed to always live up to that smile.]
208: 3908| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3909| [45] [(It's my duty... to stay by her side and watch over her.)]
210: 3914| [45] [His bond with Yuuri made his friendships with his classmates seem almost inconsequential in comparison.]
211: 3919| [45] [Adding Mashiro into the mix meant he was more than content with the interpersonal relationships he already had.]
212: 3935| [45] [With that in mind, Natsuhiko returned Yuuri's smile.]
213: 3943| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3946| [45] ["... Thank you, Yuuri."]
215: 3954| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3957| [45] ["You might get mad if I say this... but I'm glad to have you in my life."]
217: 3962| [45] [Yuuri looked a bit lonely when Natsuhiko said this.]
218: 3988| [47] [Yuuri]
219: 3991| [45] ["Ah, but you know... there's just one thing that bothers me."]
220: 3999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 4002| [45] ["Huh, what's that?"]
222: 4074| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 4077| [45] ["The fact that your relationship with Mashiron hasn't developed at all."]
224: 4103| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 4106| [45] ["Am I, well... getting in the way between you two?"]
226: 4114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 4117| [45] ["Wh-... what does Mashiro have to do with all this!?"]
228: 4143| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 4146| [45] ["Well, Mashiron's such a lovely girl, she's a great cook, and she's so nice to you, too..."]
230: 4162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
231: 4165| [45] ["I guess you're right. She does seem pretty popular at school."]
232: 4191| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 4194| [45] ["Really?"]
234: 4202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 4205| [45] ["Yeah. Guys apparently keep confessing their love to her left and right."]
236: 4231| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 4234| [45] ["C-confess!? Go on, go on!"]
238: 4242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 4245| [45] ["Well, you know that Mashiro. She apparently turns them all down. And whenever I ask her why--"]
240: 4271| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 4274| [45] ["She says 'I'm not interested in boys or romance right now. I get enough of that in manga and anime.'"]
242: 4300| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 4303| [45] ["But she gets along with you, doesn't she, Hikorin?"]
244: 4311| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 4314| [45] ["Well, Mashiro says 'I've been friends with Natsuhiko for so long that I don't see him as a guy. He's not a romantic interest' and such.'"]
246: 4322| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 4325| [45] ["And, well, I feel the same way, too."]
248: 4330| [45] [Not even Natsuhiko could deny that Mashiro was a charming girl.]
249: 4335| [45] [But since they'd been friends for so long, they were almost family. It was difficult to exchange that bond for romantic feelings.]
250: 4343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 4346| [45] ["So basically, we can't really advance to that sort of a relationship."]
252: 4372| [47] [Yuuri]
253: 4375| [45] ["Hmm... You sure...?"]
254: 4383| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 4386| [45] ["I'm sure, I'm sure."]
256: 4412| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 4415| [45] ["Hmmmm....?"]
258: 4423| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 4426| [45] ["... Look, I said I'm sure."]
260: 4434| [47] [Yuuri]
261: 4437| [45] ["Seems a little fishy..."]
262: 4445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
263: 4448| [45] ["Y-you don't believe me...?"]
264: 4453| [45] [Yuuri was quite unsubtly using the power of suggestion, but--]
265: 4465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
266: 4468| [45] ["What are you even talking about? It's not like she's only nice to me, you know."]
267: 4473| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed to find an excuse and avoid giving Yuuri the wrong idea.]
268: 4481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
269: 4484| [45] ["Her motto is 'I can't overlook anyone who's in need', you know. She's just naturally kind.%NThat's all."]
270: 4510| [47] [Yuuri]
271: 4513| [45] ["Are you sure about that...?"]
272: 4521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
273: 4524| [45] ["I'm sure, I'm sure. Besides, she's said she's not interested at all in guys, hasn't she?"]
274: 4550| [47] [Natsuhiko]
275: 4553| [45] ["She even said 'If I had to say, I'm more interested in girls, I guess.'%NThough I'm not so sure about that..."]
276: 4558| [45] [But despite his excuse, Yuuri just shot him a dubious look--]
277: 4584| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 4587| [45] ["... Just kidding."]
279: 4592| [45] [She eventually said with a smile.]
280: 4600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 4603| [45] ["Th-that's a terrible joke, Yuuri."]
282: 4629| [47] [Yuuri]
283: 4632| [45] ["I've just read a dreamy love story, so I was just thinking it would be nice to have a talk like this every now and then~"]
284: 4658| [47] [Yuuri]
285: 4661| [45] ["It was so fun seeing you all flustered, so I couldn't help but tease you for a bit."]
286: 4669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 4672| [45] ["... Well, you got me there."]
288: 4677| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri exchanged smiles.]
289: 4722| [45] [And thus, they leisurely spent their time in peace.]
290: 4727| [45] [The room was filled with not love, not friendship, but absolute peace of mind transcending either.]
291: 4732| [45] [--And after a little bit, they talked about Yuuri's third book of the day.]
292: 4737| [45] [And before they knew it, it was already late at night.]
293: 4818| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 4821| [45] ["Hmm... would you look at the time."]
295: 4844| [45] [Before Natsuhiko realized it, Yuuri's sleepy eyes were drooping too.]
296: 4852| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 4855| [45] ["How about we head to bed soon, Yuuri?"]
298: 4881| [47] [Yuuri]
299: 4884| [45] ["Hwaaah~ mm, yeah, you're right."]
300: 4925| [45] [Yuuri said as she stood up.]
301: 4951| [47] [Yuuri]
302: 4954| [45] ["... A lot sure happened today, huh..."]
303: 4962| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 4965| [45] ["Yeah. Hopefully tomorrow will be an ordinary uneventful day."]
305: 5024| [45] [Natsuhiko mused as he carried the cups to the kitchen and dumped Yuuri's milk into the sink.]
306: 5111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
307: 5114| [45] ["Okay, good night, Yuuri."]
308: 5122| [47] [Yuuri]
309: 5125| [45] ["Night..."]
310: 5226| [45] [And with that exchange of words, Natsuhiko went to turn off the lights in the living room--]
311: 5252| [45] [--when suddenly, he heard a soft voice from behind him.]
312: 5275| [85] ["... Hey, Hikorin."]
313: 5284| [86] [Yuuri]
314: 5285| [86] ["... Hey, Hikorin."]
315: 5295| [85] ["You're afraid, aren't you?"]
316: 5304| [86] [Yuuri]
317: 5305| [86] ["You're afraid, aren't you?"]
318: 5322| [47] [Natsuhiko]
319: 5325| [45] ["Huh?"]
320: 5397| [45] [Natsuhiko jumped back and looked at Yuuri.]
321: 5405| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 5408| [45] ["Afraid...? Of what?"]
323: 5416| [47] [Yuuri]
324: 5419| [45] ["Afraid of losing your peaceful days."]
325: 5427| [47] [Yuuri]
326: 5430| [45] ["Afraid that this cycle of repetitive days will come to an end."]
327: 5435| [45] [Yuuri's silhouette rose out from the darkness.]
328: 5443| [47] [Yuuri]
329: 5446| [45] ["... You're afraid that if you do anything differently, something unexpected will happen to your peaceful days, aren't you?"]
330: 5454| [47] [Yuuri]
331: 5457| [45] ["Afraid of getting others wrapped up in your actions even if you're fine acting on your own..."]
332: 5462| [45] [Yuuri's tone of voice was different from usual.]
333: 5473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
334: 5474| [45] [(Wh-what's going on...!?)]
335: 5479| [45] [--Yuuri's panic disorder had been triggered many times in the past before.]
336: 5484| [45] [But it had always been limited to when someone had tried to take her outside.]
337: 5489| [47] [Natsuhiko]
338: 5490| [45] [(But... this... is different?)]
339: 5495| [45] [He wasn't trying to take her outside, and she didn't seem to be having a panic attack.]
340: 5500| [45] [Yuuri continued in spite of Natsuhiko's confusion.]
341: 5514| [47] [Yuuri]
342: 5517| [45] ["But Hikorin, you're no longer the child you were back in those days, are you?"]
343: 5525| [47] [Yuuri]
344: 5528| [45] ["You may have already gained the strength necessary to overcome your sadness, and you don't even realize it..."]
345: 5542| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 5545| [45] ["Y-Yuuri... what are you saying?"]
347: 5594| [45] [Yuuri was lit by the moonlight shining through the window.]
348: 5599| [45] [But the light was indistinct, leaving her expression ambiguous.]
349: 5607| [47] [Yuuri]
350: 5610| [45] ["... I think a lot of things will start happening to you from now on, Hikorin."]
351: 5618| [47] [Yuuri]
352: 5621| [45] ["Fun things, painful things... and things you cannot overcome without courage."]
353: 5629| [47] [Yuuri]
354: 5632| [45] ["But they're all things you surely mustn't avoid..."]
355: 5637| [45] [Yuuri's prediction became gradually more ominous.]
356: 5642| [45] [Which disturbed Natsuhiko.]
357: 5650| [47] [Natsuhiko]
358: 5653| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...? Are you already half-asleep by any chance? You're sleep-talking, aren't you?"]
359: 5661| [47] [Yuuri]
360: 5664| [45] ["... Do you really think it's that obvious an answer?"]
361: 5672| [47] [Natsuhiko]
362: 5675| [45] ["But, I mean, usually you're already asleep at this time..."]
363: 5683| [47] [Yuuri]
364: 5686| [45] ["What time?"]
365: 5691| [45] [To answer her question, Natsuhiko took one look at his watch--]
366: 5909| [45] [And his eyes popped.]
367: 5917| [47] [Natsuhiko]
368: 5920| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
369: 5925| [45] [His watch had broken before he had realized it.]
370: 5930| [45] [The hands were frozen, in the same way they were this morning.]
371: 5938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
372: 5941| [45] ["No way... Why...?"]
373: 5946| [45] [Natsuhiko stared through the darkness at the dial in disbelief.]
374: 6013| [47] [The watch dial read--]
375: 6028| [47] ["9/16"]
376: 6036| [47] ["6:19"]
377: 6086| [47] [--Early morning, six days from today.]
