  1:   52| [45] [--The memory started right at the point where Ukita saw Subject N's body.]
  2:  128| [47] [Ukita]
  3:  129| [45] [(De... dear Lord...!)]
  4:  134| [45] [Ukita stood a bit away from the girl, paralyzed with shock.]
  5:  139| [45] [His mind went blank at the tragic sight of the girl he wanted to save, reduced to a lifeless body.]
  6:  203| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  206| [45] ["I... I'll run a vitals check on her..."]
  8:  211| [45] [Kazami ran up to Subject N and wrapped her Vital Checker around the girl's arm.]
  9:  237| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  240| [45] ["Status all red..."]
 11:  248| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  251| [45] ["Her pupils have dilated..."]
 13:  277| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  280| [45] ["Moribe, help me out. I'm going to perform CPR."]
 15:  307| [47] [Jun]
 16:  310| [45] ["R-right."]
 17:  315| [45] [The two rescue workers then laid Subject N on the floor right away and began performing CPR.]
 18:  373| [45] [15 compressions.]
 19:  378| [45] [2 rescue breaths.]
 20:  383| [45] [15 compressions.]
 21:  388| [45] [2 rescue breaths.]
 22:  393| [45] [But the light did not return to Subject N's eyes.]
 23:  401| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  404| [45] ["... It's hopeless."]
 25:  409| [45] [Ukita muttered.]
 26:  417| [47] [Ukita]
 27:  420| [45] ["She's already dead..."]
 28:  425| [45] [--Indeed. Subject N was dead.]
 29:  430| [45] [Anyone could clearly see that.]
 30:  435| [45] [Yet the rescue workers did not give up.]
 31:  440| [45] [15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths. 15 compressions. 2 rescue breaths.]
 32:  445| [45] [Ukita called out to them one more time.]
 33:  453| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  456| [45] ["You guys couldn't save her..."]
 35:  461| [45] [And then--]
 36:  469| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  472| [45] ["... And neither could I..."]
 38:  477| [45] [Color rapidly faded from Ukita's world the moment he accepted that fact.]
 39:  482| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  483| [45] [(That's right... I couldn't save her...)]
 41:  488| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  489| [45] [(I'm sorry...)]
 43:  494| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  495| [45] [(I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...)]
 45:  500| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  501| [45] [(It's my fault...)]
 47:  506| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  507| [45] [(I killed you...)]
 49:  512| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  513| [45] [(If I hadn't deluded myself with thoughts of saving you...)]
 51:  535| [45] [--Natsuhiko dumbfoundedly watched Ukita's thoughts accelerate.]
 52:  540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  541| [45] [(D-did I... mess up!?)]
 54:  546| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  547| [45] [(Did I not repair his memories enough!?)]
 56:  552| [45] [But Natsuhiko continued to view the memory, having no way of confirming his failure.]
 57:  588| [45] [--At that moment, another Ukita whispered into Ukita's mind.]
 58:  593| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  594| [45] [(No-- at the end of the day, is that really true?)]
 60:  599| [47] [Ukita]
 61:  600| [45] [(Was it really your fault she died?)]
 62:  605| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  606| [45] [(... What do you mean? If it wasn't my fault, then who else could it have been?)]
 64:  611| [47] [Ukita]
 65:  612| [45] [(Are you listening to yourself? Don't you see the suspicious people right there with you?)]
 66:  617| [47] [Ukita]
 67:  618| [45] [(...?)]
 68:  718| [47] [Ukita]
 69:  719| [45] [(Go ahead, remember. Remember those three who could have possibly taken Subject N away back then.)]
 70:  777| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  778| [45] [(But aren't Dojima and Hiyama already dead?)]
 72:  783| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  784| [45] [(Precisely. That would mean Captain Kasasagi is the one who conspired to ruin everything.)]
 74:  850| [47] [Ukita]
 75:  851| [45] [(...! But he has amnesia...)]
 76:  856| [47] [Ukita]
 77:  857| [45] [(Even if he did get amnesia, he could have killed Subject N before that happened, right?)]
 78:  862| [47] [Ukita]
 79:  863| [45] [(... I see... and there's one other suspicious person, isn't there?)]
 80:  933| [47] [Ukita]
 81:  934| [45] [(Ms. Tsubakiyama... What's a teacher doing here? How did she sneak into LABO?)]
 82:  958| [47] [Ukita]
 83:  959| [45] [(That's right... both Captain Kasasagi and Ena Tsubakiyama are suspicious.)]
 84: 1050| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1051| [45] [(And there's one other person... Yes, the one who's looking at me right now--)]
 86: 1085| [85] [("You"!)]
 87: 1090| [86] [Ukita]
 88: 1091| [86] [("You"!)]
 89: 1170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1171| [45] [(!!?)]
 91: 1176| [45] [Just then-- Natsuhiko's consciousness was wrapped up in an intense floral scent.]
 92: 1304| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1307| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 94: 1313| [45] [When he came to his senses, he was outside LABO.]
 95: 1333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1336| [45] ["W-where am I...?"]
 97: 1341| [45] [When he finished muttering that-- a voice called out from behind.]
 98: 1349| [47] [???]
 99: 1352| [45] ["This is both when and where the seeds of justice first bloomed within me."]
100: 1362| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1365| [45] ["!"]
102: 1403| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly turned around to see a girl standing there.]
103: 1411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1414| [45] ["Subject N...!"]
105: 1440| [47] [Subject N]
106: 1443| [45] ["No, that is incorrect. I am not Subject N."]
107: 1451| [47] [Subject N]
108: 1454| [45] ["On the other hand, nor am I Keiji Ukita proper."]
109: 1459| [45] [She was talking much differently that the "spirit" of Subject N that Natsuhiko had encountered in Watase's head.]
110: 1464| [45] [Much like how that spirit's speech and personality had been strongly influenced by Watase, this one had most likely been influenced by Ukita.]
111: 1469| [45] [Natsuhiko talked back to her as he thought that.]
112: 1477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1480| [45] ["Then what are you? Malice incarnate?"]
114: 1506| [47] [Subject N]
115: 1509| [45] ["Malice incarnate? Now that's a fine thing to say..."]
116: 1535| [47] [Subject N]
117: 1538| [45] ["And here I thought I had your sympathy."]
118: 1546| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1549| [45] ["Wha-- you think I sympathize with you!?"]
120: 1575| [47] [Subject N]
121: 1578| [45] ["Don't deny it. You should have come to understand several things from watching Ukita's memories."]
122: 1586| [47] [Subject N]
123: 1589| [45] ["Like his justice, and how he risked his life to save the test subjects."]
124: 1597| [47] [Subject N]
125: 1600| [45] ["But what was his reward for his efforts?%N... Right, it was the death of the girl he wanted to save."]
126: 1626| [47] [Subject N]
127: 1629| [45] ["But how did it end up that way?%N... Right, it was a traitor's doing."]
128: 1637| [47] [Subject N]
129: 1640| [45] ["Then who was that traitor?"]
130: 1666| [47] [Subject N]
131: 1669| [45] ["Who was it that betrayed my desire for there to not be any victims?"]
132: 1692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1695| [45] ["..."]
134: 1854| [47] [Subject N]
135: 1857| [45] ["... Yes, it may very well be that man you just thought of."]
136: 1865| [47] [Subject N]
137: 1868| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi betrayed Ukita."]
138: 1894| [47] [Subject N]
139: 1897| [45] ["So I gave Ukita a little nudge, and then he decided to kill him. All in accordance with our justice."]
140: 1905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1908| [45] ["H... how the hell is that justice...!?"]
142: 1913| [45] [Natsuhiko glared at her in defiance of the proclamation she had just turned at him.]
143: 1921| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1924| [45] ["You just possessed Mr. Ukita's mind and used his sense of justice as bait to foster malice in him! Isn't that right!?"]
145: 1950| [47] [Subject N]
146: 1953| [45] ["Malice, hmm? What malice might you be referring to?"]
147: 1979| [47] [Subject N]
148: 1982| [45] ["We-- Ukita and I just wanted to save the test subjects. That's all."]
149: 1990| [47] [Subject N]
150: 1993| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi must be eliminated for that purpose. Without his termination, the other test subject..."]
151: 2001| [47] [Subject N]
152: 2004| [45] ["'Subject Y-II', that is-- will most likely never escape."]
153: 2012| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2015| [45] ["...!"]
155: 2100| [45] [Those words reminded Natsuhiko of Yuuri's "deal" with Watase.]
156: 2105| [45] [She was right-- if he kept leaving Watase to his own devices, he'd eventually take Yuuri away.]
157: 2110| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2111| [45] [(I can't accept that! But...!)]
159: 2205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2208| [45] ["But still... eliminating Watase is going too far...!"]
161: 2234| [47] [Subject N]
162: 2237| [45] ["You feel guilty about the idea, don't you?"]
163: 2245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2248| [45] ["... Yeah."]
165: 2274| [47] [Subject N]
166: 2277| [45] ["I understand the sentiment. However-- consider what is truly precious to you."]
167: 2285| [47] [Subject N]
168: 2288| [45] ["Caring for Captain Kasasagi essentially equates to ignoring Subject Y-II."]
169: 2296| [47] [Subject N]
170: 2299| [45] ["Are you all right with that?"]
171: 2307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2310| [45] ["..."]
173: 2315| [45] [Natsuhiko's worries grew stronger with that question.]
174: 2368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 2369| [45] [(Yuuri spent nine years confined in this dark underground facility, all for me...)]
176: 2374| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2375| [45] [(Yet... if I still care about Watase after all that...)]
178: 2380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2381| [45] [(Wouldn't that equate to betraying Yuuri...!?)]
180: 2437| [45] [Something was gradually tainting his thoughts.]
181: 2442| [45] [But he didn't know what.]
182: 2447| [45] [Subject N pressed on.]
183: 2474| [47] [Subject N]
184: 2477| [45] ["... There are times where one must harden one's heart to protect the people one holds dear."]
185: 2485| [47] [Subject N]
186: 2488| [45] ["Both Ukita and I share in that thought-- but what about you?"]
187: 2496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
188: 2499| [45] ["I... I...!"]
189: 2526| [47] [Subject N]
190: 2529| [45] ["Answer me. What is it that you want to do?"]
191: 2537| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2540| [45] ["I--!"]
193: 2545| [45] [But right before Natsuhiko could answer that question,]
194: 2602| [45] [Yuuri's voice echoed in his head.]
195: 2626| [47] [Yuuri]
196: 2629| [45] [{Wait, Hikorin! You mustn't listen to what she says!}]
197: 2637| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2640| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...!"]
199: 2646| [45] [Natsuhiko then turned his questions to her.]
200: 2654| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 2657| [45] ["... Why not?"]
202: 2665| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2668| [45] ["She hit the nail right on the head, don't you think...?"]
204: 2693| [47] [Yuuri]
205: 2696| [45] [{Huh...!?}]
206: 2704| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 2707| [45] ["As things stand now, you won't be free even if you escape LABO, right?"]
208: 2716| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2719| [45] ["Watase will take you away and bring you to Q..."]
210: 2727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 2730| [45] ["You'll probably be faced with all sorts of danger when that happens. What's more, you can't go home either, naturally."]
212: 2738| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 2741| [45] ["So let me ask you again: are you really okay with that?"]
214: 2766| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 2769| [45] [{...}]
216: 2777| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 2780| [45] ["... Of course you're not."]
218: 2788| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 2791| [45] ["You want to be free and go home with me, right?"]
220: 2816| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 2819| [45] [{... Yes.}]
222: 2827| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 2830| [45] ["I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen."]
224: 2839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 2842| [45] ["I'll do anything for you."]
226: 2850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 2853| [45] ["So-- please don't stop me from what I'm about to do. Okay...?"]
228: 2859| [45] [When she heard that, Yuuri--]
229: 2864| [45] [Finally answered after a long silence.]
230: 2889| [47] [Yuuri]
231: 2892| [45] [{... You're... right... You're right, Hikorin.}]
232: 2917| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 2920| [45] [{I've been wrong this whole time... I thought I would be okay with whatever misery I faced so long as everyone else was happy...}]
234: 2925| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 2928| [45] [{But... that was all a total lie...}]
236: 2953| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 2956| [45] [{I've actually wanted to be just as happy as anyone else all these years. Yet I...!}]
238: 2964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 2967| [45] ["It's okay, I understand."]
240: 2976| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 2979| [45] ["So to protect your happiness--"]
242: 2987| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 2990| [45] ["I'm going to fight Watase. Just like Mr. Ukita did."]
244: 3015| [47] [Yuuri]
245: 3018| [45] [{... Thank you, Hikorin.}]
246: 3101| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded, then looked straight at Subject N.]
247: 3110| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 3113| [45] ["... Subject N..."]
249: 3121| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 3124| [45] ["I'm sorry. You're exactly right."]
251: 3151| [47] [Subject N]
252: 3154| [45] ["I see... So you finally understand?"]
253: 3159| [45] [She smiled happily after she said that.]
254: 3186| [47] [Subject N]
255: 3189| [45] ["Then return to the real world. You're the one with a body, so it's your job to take care of the 'problem'."]
256: 3197| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3200| [45] ["Yeah..."]
258: 3227| [47] [Subject N]
259: 3230| [45] ["I'm counting on you. Carry out your justice."]
260: 3295| [45] [And as he listened to that voice--]
261: 3300| [45] [Natsuhiko cut off his Senses Sympathy link to Ukita.]
262: 3374| [45] [--Meanwhile, in the real world--]
263: 3379| [45] [Watase was staring at Natsuhiko and Yuuri with a firm expression on his face.]
264: 3384| [45] [It had already been over three minutes since the two of them had begun repairing Ukita's memories.]
265: 3389| [45] [But neither of them showed any signs of waking up.]
266: 3394| [47] [Watase]
267: 3395| [45] [(Are they okay...?)]
268: 3400| [45] [Watase grew more and more nervous the more he watched the two of them standing there like statues, not budging an inch.]
269: 3405| [45] [But at that moment--]
270: 3461| [47] [All 3]
271: 3462| [45] ["..."]
272: 3467| [45] [The three of them woke up at the same time as if it were a synchronized routine.]
273: 3477| [47] [Watase]
274: 3480| [45] ["... I-is it over?"]
275: 3485| [45] [Watase asked Natsuhiko that question.]
276: 3515| [45] [But the boy didn't answer. He just stared hard at Watase's face.]
277: 3523| [47] [Watase]
278: 3526| [45] ["H-hey... something wrong?"]
279: 3550| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 3551| [45] ["..."]
281: 3556| [45] [Yuuri then spoke up in a faint voice shortly afterwards.]
282: 3583| [47] [Yuuri]
283: 3586| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Captain Kasasagi."]
284: 3594| [47] [Yuuri]
285: 3597| [45] ["When it comes down to it, I just don't want to go with you."]
286: 3605| [47] [Watase]
287: 3608| [45] ["Wh-what!?"]
288: 3635| [47] [Ukita]
289: 3638| [45] ["Sorry, Captain Kasasagi. I won't hand Yuuri over to you. That's the way it is."]
290: 3646| [47] [Watase]
291: 3649| [45] ["...!"]
292: 3657| [47] [Watase]
293: 3660| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko... what's the meaning of this!?"]
294: 3665| [45] [He trembled as he asked his question.]
295: 3788| [45] [When he did, Natsuhiko stood up and grabbed Watase by the wrist.]
296: 3816| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 3819| [45] ["Do you really have to ask? We were enemies from the very start, weren't we?"]
298: 3824| [45] [A shiver ran down Watase's spine at that moment.]
299: 3829| [45] [He noticed that everyone else's eyes were filled with a sinister light.]
300: 3837| [47] [Watase]
301: 3840| [45] ["I-it can't be... Have you guys all been infected by malice!?"]
302: 3870| [47] [Natsuhiko]
303: 3873| [45] ["Disappear, Watase. For good this time."]
304: 3881| [47] [Watase]
