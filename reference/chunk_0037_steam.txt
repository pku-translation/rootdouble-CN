  1:   54| [45] [Watase's group went back to the outer ring through the connecting passageway.]
  2:   98| [45] [--And when they got there, they heard the sound of Kazami's group's voice echoing in the hallway.]
  3:  184| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  187| [45] ["I keep telling you, it's too dangerous to drink that!"]
  5:  267| [47] [Ukita]
  6:  270| [45] ["But my thirst is at its limits!"]
  7:  354| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  357| [45] ["... Honestly... it's getting tough for me too..."]
  9:  448| [45] [It seemed they were arguing about something, so Watase's group ran over and intervened.]
 10:  456| [47] [Watase]
 11:  459| [45] ["What's going on? Did you find some AD?"]
 12:  485| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  488| [45] ["Ah, Captain. No, we didn't find any AD or survivors, but..."]
 14:  514| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  517| [45] ["But we found this."]
 16:  522| [45] [Ukita then showed the rest of the group what he held between his arms.]
 17:  527| [45] [They were six plastic 500 mL bottles that read "distilled water".]
 18:  532| [45] [Just enough for everyone.]
 19:  540| [47] [Watase]
 20:  543| [45] ["Water!? You found water!?"]
 21:  569| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  572| [45] ["Yes, though it appears to be water meant for mixing with medicine."]
 23:  598| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  601| [45] ["But I've been telling him not to drink it because there's a possibility that it'll give us radiation exposure from the inside..."]
 25:  606| [45] [However, everyone gulped when they saw the water.]
 26:  611| [45] [Just as Ukita and Yuuri said, their throats were parched like a desert.]
 27:  616| [45] [True, they couldn't be sure it was safe to drink, but--]
 28:  720| [47] [Ena]
 29:  723| [45] ["I-I... It's probably risky, but I want to drink it anyway."]
 30:  750| [47] [Jun]
 31:  753| [45] ["You too?"]
 32:  781| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  784| [45] ["No, I think she's right, in fact."]
 34:  792| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  795| [45] ["We found these in a metal medicine cabinet, so the possibility that they've been contaminated by radiation is extremely low."]
 36:  821| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  824| [45] ["And naturally, there's a 0%% chance that there's any atomic dust in them. It's completely separate from the tap water that way."]
 38:  829| [45] [Now that he mentioned it, Kazami had said earlier that there was a chance that the water in the facility was contaminated by radiation.]
 39:  834| [45] [But that was tap water she'd been talking about-- water that was openly exposed to that radiation. The water in the plastic bottles was, in theory, safe, just as Ukita had said.]
 40:  842| [47] [Watase]
 41:  845| [45] ["Th-then... isn't it okay for us to drink it, Tachibana?"]
 42:  871| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  874| [45] ["But if there's even the slightest chance that it isn't--"]
 44:  900| [47] [Ena]
 45:  903| [45] ["Argh, just quit complaining already!"]
 46:  908| [45] [Ena said that and snatched a plastic bottle out of Ukita's hands.]
 47:  934| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  937| [45] ["Ah!"]
 49: 1044| [45] [Ena unscrewed the cap and took a giant swig of the water before Kazami even had time to stop her.]
 50: 1049| [45] [But a second later--]
 51: 1115| [47] [Ena]
 52: 1118| [45] ["... *cough*!"]
 53: 1123| [45] [She started choking.]
 54: 1184| [47] [Ena]
 55: 1187| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
 56: 1228| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1231| [45] ["T-Teach!?"]
 58: 1257| [47] [Jun]
 59: 1260| [45] ["Was there something bad in there!?"]
 60: 1268| [47] [Ena]
 61: 1271| [45] ["... Ack... n-no."]
 62: 1297| [47] [Ena]
 63: 1300| [45] ["I just drank way too much too quickly, so some of it got stuck in my throat, that's all."]
 64: 1305| [45] [The group all breathed a sigh of relief.]
 65: 1331| [47] [Ena]
 66: 1334| [45] ["Anyway, why don't the rest of you join in? The taste is to die for... I never knew that water could taste this good."]
 67: 1339| [45] [Ena broke out into an entranced smile.]
 68: 1344| [45] [This only caused more and more people to give into their desires.]
 69: 1370| [47] [Ukita]
 70: 1373| [45] ["--I-I'll have some too!"]
 71: 1399| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1402| [45] ["Me too!"]
 73: 1485| [45] [With that, Ukita and Yuuri suddenly snapped into action by taking their own plastic bottles and drinking them.]
 74: 1511| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1514| [45] ["Aah...!"]
 76: 1519| [45] [Kazami let out a defeated shout.]
 77: 1524| [45] [She'd probably realized that no fear of internal radiation exposure could keep them away from the allure of water.]
 78: 1532| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1535| [45] ["... Sorry, Tachibana, but I'm gonna have some too."]
 80: 1562| [47] [Jun]
 81: 1565| [45] ["M-me too...!"]
 82: 1591| [47] [Kazami]
 83: 1594| [45] ["... I suppose it can't be helped. Well, it does indeed seem safe..."]
 84: 1637| [45] [Kazami also caved in. In the end, everyone took a plastic bottle for themselves.]
 85: 1642| [45] [They unscrewed the caps with trembling hands and drank away while being careful not to choke on it.]
 86: 1647| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1648| [45] [(...!)]
 88: 1653| [45] [Fresh water was soaking into Watase's parched throat.]
 89: 1658| [45] [Even though the water was at room temperature and therefore not cold at all, it was unbelievably tasty.]
 90: 1666| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1669| [45] ["... Aaah! I feel alive again!"]
 92: 1731| [47] [Jun]
 93: 1734| [45] ["Yeah, it makes me wanna cry tears of joy!!"]
 94: 1775| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1778| [45] ["N-now that we've quenched our thirst... let's get back to talking about the search, shall we?"]
 96: 1783| [45] [Kazami said this in a slightly uncomfortable voice. The rest of the group all promptly nodded.]
 97: 1809| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1812| [45] ["We only found water in the outer ring... but what about the inner ring team?"]
 99: 1820| [47] [Watase]
100: 1823| [45] ["Zilch. Just some medical ointment."]
101: 1851| [47] [Ena]
102: 1854| [45] ["So in the end, this block was a dud, huh..."]
103: 1859| [45] [Everyone's shoulders slumped at Ena's comment.]
104: 1885| [47] [Jun]
105: 1888| [45] ["... C'mon guys, don't get so down in the dumps. Let's keep on searching."]
106: 1896| [47] [Watase]
107: 1899| [45] ["Then let's go check B2 of this area. We'll use the emergency staircase to get down there."]
108: 1942| [45] [The group started walking again after finishing that discussion.]
109: 1947| [45] [But when they got to the staircase--]
110: 1952| [45] [Watase noticed something odd about the wall in front of it.]
111: 1961| [47] [Watase]
112: 1964| [45] ["Hmm...?"]
113: 2008| [45] [Located on the wall was a small plate that read "EMERGENCY".]
114: 2013| [45] [Right below it was a keypad of sorts with ten buttons labeled from 0 to 9.]
115: 2032| [47] [Watase]
116: 2035| [45] ["Hey, hold on a sec, guys."]
117: 2189| [47] [Kazami]
118: 2192| [45] ["Huh?"]
119: 2200| [47] [Watase]
120: 2203| [45] ["What do you think this is?"]
121: 2224| [45] [The group turned to Watase and gathered around the keypad.]
122: 2254| [47] [Jun]
123: 2257| [45] ["Hmm... what indeed?"]
124: 2285| [47] [Ukita]
125: 2288| [45] ["I don't know... maybe it's an emergency telephone line or something?"]
126: 2299| [45] [Watase randomly pressed the buttons.]
127: 2304| [45] [But nothing happened. He didn't hear any dialing or anything.]
128: 2330| [47] [Kazami]
129: 2333| [45] ["If it's a phone, then it looks like it's broken, doesn't it?"]
130: 2359| [47] [Jun]
131: 2362| [45] ["Guess this means every last communication device was wiped out."]
132: 2388| [47] [Ena]
133: 2391| [45] ["We shouldn't dwell on something that doesn't work. Let's go."]
134: 2399| [47] [Watase]
135: 2402| [45] ["Good point."]
136: 2445| [45] [Watase nodded and was about to walk off--]
137: 2522| [47] [Yuuri]
138: 2523| [45] ["..."]
139: 2528| [45] [But Yuuri didn't budge an inch.]
140: 2533| [45] [She stared firmly at the "EMERGENCY" plate.]
141: 2587| [47] [Watase]
142: 2590| [45] ["Hmm? Is something wrong, Yuuri?"]
143: 2651| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 2654| [45] ["Aah...!"]
145: 2659| [45] [Yuuri turned around in surprise at Watase's voice.]
146: 2667| [47] [Watase]
147: 2670| [45] ["Something about it catch your eye?"]
148: 2696| [47] [Yuuri]
149: 2699| [45] ["No... I'm just a little tired, that's all."]
150: 2712| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Yuuri's face was a little pale.]
151: 2720| [47] [Watase]
152: 2723| [45] ["You okay? Would you like to find a place to rest?"]
153: 2728| [45] [But just as Watase asked that--]
154: 2762| [47] [Ena]
155: 2765| [45] ["What're you guys doing? I'm going on ahead, you know!"]
156: 2797| [45] [Ena said that and entered the stairwell.]
157: 2802| [45] [Watase ignored her and spoke to Yuuri in the kindest voice he could manage.]
158: 2810| [47] [Watase]
159: 2813| [45] ["Just hang in there. We'll be out of here before you know it."]
160: 2824| [47] [Watase]
161: 2827| [45] ["I see..."]
162: 2832| [45] [As Watase pondered over what to do--]
163: 2865| [47] [Ena]
164: 2868| [45] ["What're you guys doing? I'm going on ahead, you know!"]
165: 2900| [45] [Ena said that and entered the stairwell.]
166: 2908| [47] [Watase]
167: 2911| [45] ["... Let's go, Yuuri."]
168: 2937| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 2940| [45] ["... Okay."]
170: 2945| [45] [Her voice was frail, but she still obeyed Watase.]
171: 3002| [45] [--Watase and Yuuri headed towards the outer ring stairwell with the rest of the group,%NEna  already out of sight.]
172: 3007| [45] [The room was pitch black.]
173: 3058| [45] [He couldn't see Ena anymore. She must have already gone downstairs.]
174: 3066| [47] [Watase]
175: 3069| [45] ["... Hey, why's it so dark in here?"]
176: 3102| [47] [Kazami]
177: 3105| [45] ["It appears the fluorescent lights are dead. Please watch your step, people."]
178: 3144| [45] [The group obeyed and slowly descended the staircase.]
179: 3149| [45] [But when he'd made it just halfway...]
180: 3182| [47] [Watase]
181: 3185| [45] ["What's that...?"]
182: 3190| [45] [... Watase felt a tremor at his feet and instinctively came to a halt.]
183: 3195| [45] [And right after that--]
184: 3254| [47] [Yuuri]
185: 3257| [45] ["Kyah!"]
186: 3343| [47] [Ukita]
187: 3346| [45] ["Wh-what's happening!?"]
188: 3388| [47] [Jun]
189: 3391| [45] ["--The staircase is starting to lean!?"]
190: 3465| [47] [Kazami]
191: 3468| [45] ["Everyone, turn back! The staircase is collapsing!"]
192: 3482| [47] [All]
193: 3485| [45] ["!?"]
194: 3503| [47] [Kazami]
195: 3506| [45] ["Run! Hurry!"]
196: 3573| [45] [But Ena flashed through Watase's mind at that moment.]
197: 3578| [45] [She didn't have a Procyon. Would she be all right all on her own--!?]
198: 3612| [47] [Kazami]
199: 3615| [45] ["What are you doing, Captain!?"]
200: 3628| [45] [But Watase's feelings persevered.]
201: 3633| [47] [Watase]
202: 3634| [45] [(--I can't leave Teach all by herself!)]
203: 3639| [45] [Watase turned back downstairs, guided by that thought.]
204: 3652| [47] [Watase]
205: 3655| [45] ["S-sorry!"]
206: 3702| [45] [Watase and the others ran up the stairs.]
207: 3707| [45] [And just when they'd all made it to the top--]
208: 3773| [45] [The staircase tore apart with a thunderous roar.]
