  0:   41| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 5]
  1:   68| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu checked the whole town.]
  2:  128| [45] [They combed through every place Mashiro was likely to go.]
  3:  133| [45] [But there was no sign that they would find her.]
  4:  194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  197| [45] ["Dammit! Where the hell is Mashiro!?"]
  6:  223| [47] [Salyu]
  7:  226| [45] ["We should rest a bit. We've already been running around for 20 minutes."]
  8:  231| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  234| [45] ["Khh... guess you're right."]
 10:  239| [45] [Natsuhiko combed through his disheveled hair and took a few deep breaths.]
 11:  244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  247| [45] ["... Dammit, Mashiro, you're not making it any easier for us...!"]
 13:  252| [45] [As he muttered that, Salyu responded in a cold voice.]
 14:  278| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  281| [45] ["You've been cursing this whole time, Natsuhiko. If it's that frustrating, then you don't have to look for her."]
 16:  307| [47] [Salyu]
 17:  310| [45] ["Besides, you think Mashiro's mistaken about there being terrorists, don't you?"]
 18:  315| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  318| [45] ["I may not believe her about the terrorists, but regardless, I'm still worried about her."]
 20:  323| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  326| [45] ["Our friend is suddenly gone. You can understand that I'd be worried, right?"]
 22:  352| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  355| [45] ["No, I don't understand. Your words and your actions contradict."]
 24:  381| [47] [Salyu]
 25:  384| [45] ["If you don't believe Mashiro, then why don't you just leave her alone?"]
 26:  389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  392| [45] ["What!?"]
 28:  418| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  421| [45] ["According to you, there are no terrorists. In that case, leaving Mashiro alone would be the obvious thing to do."]
 30:  426| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  429| [45] ["... That's kind of dry."]
 32:  434| [45] [Natsuhiko was a little perturbed.]
 33:  439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  442| [45] ["You've received quite a bit of Mashiro's favor too, haven't you Salyu?"]
 35:  468| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  471| [45] ["That's a completely different story. I'm just giving a logical conclusion."]
 37:  476| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  479| [45] ["Hey... don't you think you're being a little too cold?"]
 39:  484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  487| [45] ["You're not gonna make any friends like that."]
 41:  514| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  517| [45] ["..."]
 43:  522| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  525| [45] ["...!"]
 45:  530| [45] [Natsuhiko regretted those words as soon as they left his lips. That was essentially an outburst of anger.]
 46:  535| [45] [But Salyu calmly replied.]
 47:  567| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  570| [45] ["That's fine. It's impossible for me to have friends anyway."]
 49:  575| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  578| [45] ["Hey... That's not fine at all. They say humans need others in order to live."]
 51:  604| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  607| [45] ["Then let me turn the question around. What exactly is a 'friend'?"]
 53:  612| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  615| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 55:  620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  623| [45] ["A friend is someone you frequently do stuff with..."]
 57:  628| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  631| [45] ["And, well, you share in each other's fun times and sad times, I guess?"]
 59:  636| [45] [Natsuhiko gave a general answer to Salyu's blunt question.]
 60:  662| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  665| [45] ["Yes. That's what I've heard friends were like."]
 62:  691| [47] [Salyu]
 63:  694| [45] ["And that's why it's impossible for me to make friends."]
 64:  699| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  702| [45] ["It's not impossible, is it? If you think normally..."]
 66:  728| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  731| [45] ["It really is impossible."]
 68:  736| [45] [Salyu interrupted Natsuhiko-- and informed him of a truth he had never heard before.]
 69:  744| [47] [Salyu]
 70:  747| [45] ["I cannot understand other people's feelings at all."]
 71:  755| [47] [Salyu]
 72:  758| [45] ["Because my brain lacks that function."]
 73:  763| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74:  766| [45] ["Wh-what...?"]
 75:  771| [45] [Natsuhiko unintentionally gasped.]
 76:  776| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  779| [45] ["B-but Salyu, you still have emotions, don't you?"]
 78:  805| [47] [Salyu]
 79:  808| [45] ["Of course. Even I can have emotions."]
 80:  813| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81:  816| [45] ["Then can't you just apply that to other people...?"]
 82:  824| [47] [Salyu]
 83:  827| [45] ["No, I cannot."]
 84:  835| [47] [Salyu]
 85:  838| [45] ["Even though I understand that other people have emotions, I cannot comprehend how those emotions change."]
 86:  846| [47] [Salyu]
 87:  849| [45] ["That is my defect. What I lost in exchange for high functionality elsewhere."]
 88:  854| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89:  857| [45] ["...!"]
 90:  883| [47] [Salyu]
 91:  886| [45] ["All I can do is judge whether to believe or to reject the words of others."]
 92:  894| [47] [Salyu]
 93:  897| [45] ["Nonverbal and finely nuanced expressions of emotion are beyond my comprehension."]
 94:  905| [47] [Salyu]
 95:  908| [45] ["And now you say you don't believe there are terrorists. And yet you're looking for Mashiro. That's a contradiction."]
 96:  934| [47] [Salyu]
 97:  937| [45] ["I'm just confused about that."]
 98:  942| [45] [Salyu hung her head as she finished.]
 99:  947| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100:  948| [45] [(Is that even possible...?)]
101:  953| [45] [But despite his doubts, he felt a sinking feeling in his stomach.]
102:  958| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103:  959| [45] [(I see now... So that's why she treasures Alice so much.)]
104:  964| [45] [Salyu said that ARMS was a device meant to read the moods of others.]
105:  969| [45] [So that was why she couldn't ever be without it.]
106:  974| [45] [If she couldn't understand other people's feelings, then she had no choice but to trust in Alice's judgment.]
107:  979| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108:  982| [45] ["... Is it genetic?"]
109:  990| [47] [Salyu]
110:  993| [45] ["Yes, I believe so. The brain is just another part of the body, after all."]
111: 1019| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1022| [45] ["Just as the body has its own physical dispositions, it's only natural for the brain to have its own as well."]
113: 1048| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1051| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you don't understand the feelings of trees, or flowers, or insects, do you?"]
115: 1056| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1059| [45] ["N-no... I really can't say that I do."]
117: 1067| [47] [Salyu]
118: 1070| [45] ["It's probably the same concept. I cannot tell the difference between a human mind and an insect mind."]
119: 1096| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1099| [45] ["My brain does not even attempt to process the feelings of others."]
121: 1104| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1107| [45] ["That's just so--"]
123: 1112| [45] [--so sad.]
124: 1117| [45] [Natsuhiko forcibly swallowed that word down.]
125: 1122| [45] [Because Salyu most likely was not seeking pity when she told him this truth.]
126: 1127| [45] [But still, Natsuhiko wanted to at least say something, so he tried his best to wring some words out.]
127: 1132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1135| [45] ["... BC..."]
129: 1140| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1143| [45] ["That's it. BC can help you understand other people's minds, can't it...?"]
131: 1148| [45] [Sure enough, Salyu supposedly had Rank D Aptitude.]
132: 1153| [45] [She could learn how to use empathy. It would take a considerable amount of effort, but it wouldn't be impossible.]
133: 1158| [45] [And if she did, it would make living easier for her, or so Natsuhiko thought--]
134: 1184| [47] [Salyu]
135: 1187| [45] ["There's no hope for that. My actual aptitude is Rank F. Ability's nonexistent as well."]
136: 1238| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1241| [45] ["Huh...?"]
138: 1246| [45] [Rank F Aptitude specified that one was unable to use BC at all.]
139: 1251| [45] [In other words, no amount of effort would ever allow one to use BC.]
140: 1256| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1259| [45] ["W-wait, then why did Prof. Tsubakiyama say you were Rank D...?"]
142: 1285| [47] [Salyu]
143: 1288| [45] ["Because Rokumei Academy does not accept applicants with Rank F Aptitude.%NDr. Tenkawa forged my medical certificate."]
144: 1301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 1304| [45] ["She went so far as to do that...?"]
146: 1309| [45] [Salyu nodded plainly.]
147: 1314| [45] [It was hard to believe-- but judging by her expression, it didn't seem dubious at all.]
148: 1322| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1325| [45] ["She forged it? Is that even possible...?"]
150: 1351| [47] [Salyu]
151: 1354| [45] ["You don't believe it?"]
152: 1359| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 1362| [45] ["No, I mean, back in class, you were able to perceive my characteristic brain waveform, weren't you?"]
154: 1388| [47] [Salyu]
155: 1391| [45] ["I merely pretended to."]
156: 1396| [45] [Her admission jogged his memory.]
157: 1473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1476| [45] ["What about you, Salyu? Did you perceive my waveform?"]
159: 1502| [47] [Salyu]
160: 1505| [45] ["... Umm, probably. I think it's that one."]
161: 1510| [45] [Salyu pointed to the upper part of the Enneagram.]
162: 1515| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 1518| [45] ["Wow Salyu, you really are a quick learner. That's right, I'm a Type 7."]
164: 1594| [45] [--Now that he thought about it, Salyu didn't actually answer. Natsuhiko just jumped to conclusions.]
165: 1599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 1602| [45] ["... So you really can't use it?"]
167: 1628| [47] [Salyu]
168: 1631| [45] ["I have tried practicing in the past, though. I thought that if I could use BC, I could understand people's feelings."]
169: 1657| [47] [Salyu]
170: 1660| [45] ["But it was impossible for me."]
171: 1686| [47] [Salyu]
172: 1689| [45] ["When Mashiro was teaching us yesterday, I finally got motivated again. But it's not a problem of motivation."]
173: 1694| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 1695| [45] ["..."]
175: 1721| [47] [Salyu]
176: 1724| [45] ["I've long since given up. There's no way I can understand other people's minds."]
177: 1750| [47] [Salyu]
178: 1753| [45] ["I came to Japan, met all of you, and had fun, but... at times, I've also been confused, and also scared."]
179: 1761| [47] [Salyu]
180: 1764| [45] ["Perhaps I really wasn't meant to interact with other people."]
181: 1769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 1770| [45] [(How exactly must that feel...!?)]
183: 1775| [45] [To be unable to understand others no matter how much you try.]
184: 1780| [45] [To be the only one left out when everyone else around you reaches understanding of what's on each others' minds--]
185: 1785| [45] [Natsuhiko was at a loss just trying to imagine it.]
186: 1790| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 1791| [45] [(I see...)]
188: 1796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 1797| [45] [(Salyu's relationship to others is like the relationship between Communicators and ordinary people.)]
190: 1802| [45] [Once he thought about it that way, a memory of the past arose from the back of his mind.]
191: 1863| [45] [--When he was young, Natsuhiko was the center of attention for the neighborhood kids.]
192: 1868| [45] [Back then, Natsuhiko loved BC.]
193: 1873| [45] [Without thinking too deeply about it, he yearned to be something special, which was why he dreamed of becoming a Communicator.]
194: 1878| [45] [But right before he got into elementary school, he learned that he really did have the aptitude to become one for real...]
195: 1883| [45] [And thus it was decided that he and Mashiro would enroll in Rokumei Academy.]
196: 1942| [45] [Which meant that eventually they had to leave all their previous friends behind.]
197: 1947| [45] [People stopped gathering in the park they always played in.]
198: 1952| [45] [The only ones to stay with Natsuhiko were Yuuri and Mashiro.]
199: 1957| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 1960| [45] ["Huh, nobody's here today either... Why'd everyone leave?"]
201: 2001| [47] [Mashiro]
202: 2004| [45] ["They said we'd always be friends even once we started elementary school..."]
203: 2009| [45] [Yuuri spoke up after Natsuhiko and Mashiro muttered those words.]
204: 2017| [47] [Yuuri]
205: 2020| [45] ["... It's because we're Communicators and the others are ordinary people."]
206: 2025| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 2028| [45] ["Huh?"]
208: 2036| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 2039| [45] ["They might be scared of us reading their minds..."]
210: 2044| [45] [Since Yuuri was two years their senior, she likely had a better understanding of society.]
211: 2049| [45] [Particularly the social implications surrounding Communicators.]
212: 2075| [47] [Mashiro]
213: 2078| [45] ["What's up with that...? I don't get it at all."]
214: 2083| [47] [Natsuhiko]
215: 2086| [45] ["... But we can't even use telepathy yet..."]
216: 2091| [45] [They could do nothing but deny Yuuri's observation.]
217: 2096| [45] [Which only made her smile sadly.]
218: 2122| [47] [Yuuri]
219: 2125| [45] ["That's true, but still..."]
220: 2151| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 2154| [45] ["Just because we know that doesn't mean we can convince them to believe it too."]
222: 2159| [45] [Natsuhiko just couldn't comprehend what Yuuri was implying.]
223: 2164| [45] [But he took her words and facial expression, and engraved them into his heart.]
224: 2258| [45] [--And that was possibly the first time Natsuhiko began to feel that he couldn't understand what was on other people's minds.]
225: 2263| [45] [But he was still okay with that.]
226: 2268| [45] [If he acquired the skill of empathy to read the minds of others, then he would be able to understand the feelings of those who distanced themselves from him.]
227: 2273| [45] [At least, that's what he had hoped--]
228: 2332| [45] [His second major turning point was the incident nine years ago.]
229: 2393| [47] [Yuuri]
230: 2396| [45] ["Noooooo! No! Noooo!"]
231: 2401| [45] [Yuuri used to be calm no matter what the situation, but that all changed after the incident.]
232: 2444| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 2447| [45] ["I don't want to go outside! I hate it! I don't wanna go!!"]
234: 2490| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 2493| [45] ["Don't make me leave! Let me stay here!!"]
236: 2498| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself stunned and dumbfounded when faced with Yuuri's refusal to leave the house.]
237: 2503| [45] [Yuuri's transfiguration made Natsuhiko sad, dejected, and regretful to the core...]
238: 2508| [45] [... As well as a little frightened.]
239: 2594| [45] [--Ever since then, Yuuri stopped going to school and her BC ability never improved.]
240: 2599| [45] [And Natsuhiko lost the motivation to train his BC ability as well.]
241: 2604| [45] [For if one day, he were to become able to read Yuuri's mind...]
242: 2609| [45] [And what he saw there was resentment towards him, then he...!]
243: 2614| [45] [He would probably never recover.]
244: 2619| [45] [While he did want to know what was in her heart, his fear of actually knowing far outweighed his curiosity to know.]
245: 2624| [45] [So instead-- he swore at the very least to watch over her.]
246: 2629| [45] [Even if his oath was worth nothing more than a pittance of atonement.]
247: 2634| [45] [Even if staying by her side had nothing to do with actually understanding her.]
248: 2718| [45] [--Even now, Natsuhiko could not completely cast aside his fear of other people.]
249: 2723| [45] [His fear of knowing what lied in other people's minds. And his fear of knowing what clouded his own mind as well.]
250: 2728| [45] [That was why he kept his distance from his classmates.]
251: 2733| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 2734| [45] [(But how is it with Salyu...?)]
253: 2739| [45] [He thought back to the day she transferred in.]
254: 2744| [45] [Salyu avoided the other classmates and sat in her seat all alone.]
255: 2749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 2750| [45] [(Does she avoid everyone in the same way that ordinary people avoid Communicators?)]
257: 2755| [45] [That was somehow similar to what Natsuhiko did--]
258: 2760| [45] [Which was why he couldn't help but say...]
259: 2766| [47] [Natsuhiko]
260: 2769| [45] ["... Don't tell yourself you weren't meant to interact with other people."]
261: 2795| [47] [Salyu]
262: 2798| [45] ["Huh?"]
263: 2803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 2806| [45] ["It's true that we can't understand other people's feelings."]
265: 2811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
266: 2814| [45] ["We all have times when we're confused. Times when we're scared."]
267: 2819| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 2822| [45] ["... But we should still consider other people's feelings, shouldn't we?"]
269: 2827| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought that perhaps he wasn't the most qualified of people to speak on this subject.]
270: 2832| [45] [But regardless, he continued.]
271: 2837| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 2840| [45] ["Right now as I speak, I'm trying in my own way to consider your feelings, Salyu. But is it really pointless for me to try?"]
273: 2863| [47] [Salyu]
274: 2864| [45] ["..."]
275: 2890| [47] [Salyu]
276: 2893| [45] ["... Hmm."]
277: 2919| [47] [Salyu]
278: 2922| [45] ["So? Can you tell anything about my feelings?"]
279: 2927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 2930| [45] ["... No, I can't. Because I'm not you, see?"]
281: 2956| [47] [Salyu]
282: 2959| [45] ["Right. So in the end, it really was pointless--"]
283: 2964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
284: 2967| [45] ["You're wrong."]
285: 2972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
286: 2975| [45] ["When I say we can't understand other people's feelings, I don't just mean you and me, Salyu. Nobody truly can."]
287: 3001| [47] [Salyu]
288: 3004| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
289: 3012| [47] [Salyu]
290: 3015| [45] ["It's not just me... but everyone?"]
291: 3020| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 3023| [45] ["Yeah. That's right."]
293: 3028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 3031| [45] ["After all, there are so many things different between you and me. Our genders. Our abilities. And so much more. So there's no way I can understand your feelings."]
295: 3036| [47] [Natsuhiko]
296: 3039| [45] ["... And I'm sure that's a universal truth that applies to any two people."]
297: 3044| [45] [Natsuhiko could not hope to know the world as Salyu observed it, and thus, neither could he hope to have a complete understanding of her feelings.]
298: 3049| [45] [The same went for Yuuri. Even with empathy, the best he could ever hope for was a glimpse of a small facet of her mind.]
299: 3054| [45] [And that's to say nothing of his fear of learning something he shouldn't.]
300: 3059| [45] [He had always thought this way. But--]
301: 3064| [47] [Natsuhiko]
302: 3067| [45] ["But don't you think... we should still try our best to understand each other regardless?"]
303: 3072| [45] [Natsuhiko vocalized an idea that he himself had always been rejecting.]
304: 3077| [45] [But as he vocalized it, he gradually became more and more aware.]
305: 3082| [45] [Aware of how it was an idea that he had originally always held.]
306: 3087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
307: 3090| [45] ["... You don't need a full understanding of what's on other people's minds. But as long as you keep striving for it... In other words, as long as you keep other people in consideration..."]
308: 3095| [47] [Natsuhiko]
309: 3098| [45] ["Then I'm sure things will turn out for the best. Both for you and for those you interact with..."]
310: 3103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
311: 3106| [45] ["And unless you afford that kindness to others, nobody will be kind to you, will they?"]
312: 3132| [47] [Salyu]
313: 3135| [45] ["... That's the first time anyone has ever said that to me."]
314: 3140| [47] [Natsuhiko]
315: 3143| [45] ["Well, it's the first time I've ever said it to anyone, too."]
316: 3169| [47] [Salyu]
317: 3172| [45] ["You're strange. I don't have the slightest idea what thought process led you to say something like that, Natsuhiko."]
318: 3177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
319: 3180| [45] ["Yeah, you don't have to understand that either."]
320: 3206| [47] [Salyu]
321: 3209| [45] ["... I don't?"]
322: 3214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
323: 3217| [45] ["That way of thinking's just a lot less stressful, isn't it?"]
324: 3240| [47] [Salyu]
325: 3241| [45] ["..."]
326: 3246| [45] [Salyu hung her head as if deep in thought.]
327: 3251| [45] [She eventually looked up and asked Natsuhiko a question.]
328: 3277| [47] [Salyu]
329: 3280| [45] ["... So basically, you're saying that's the reason you can frantically search for Mashiro while simultaneously cursing her name?"]
330: 3285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
331: 3288| [45] ["Huh? Uh... yeah. Exactly."]
332: 3293| [45] [Because of the unexpected turn his conversation with Salyu had taken, Natsuhiko had forgotten about Mashiro for a moment.]
333: 3298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
334: 3301| [45] ["I don't understand what she's thinking, but unless I find her and ask her myself, I'll never even get close to understanding her feelings, will I?"]
335: 3327| [47] [Salyu]
336: 3330| [45] ["Is that what it means to worry about someone?"]
337: 3335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
338: 3338| [45] ["Yeah, probably."]
339: 3410| [47] [Salyu]
340: 3413| [45] ["I see..."]
341: 3418| [45] [Salyu nodded with that and continued.]
342: 3444| [47] [Salyu]
343: 3447| [45] ["I still don't understand. I don't understand how your feelings are causing your words and actions to contradict, Natsuhiko."]
344: 3473| [47] [Salyu]
345: 3476| [45] ["But... it did make me happy to hear that people in general can't understand other people's feelings."]
346: 3508| [47] [Salyu]
347: 3511| [45] ["It helps a little to know that. Thank you."]
348: 3524| [45] [Natsuhiko was startled by her honest expression of gratitude.]
349: 3529| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 3532| [45] ["I-it wasn't anything you needed to thank me for, really. It's just..."]
351: 3558| [47] [Salyu]
352: 3561| [45] ["Just what?"]
353: 3566| [47] [Natsuhiko]
354: 3569| [45] ["... Nah, it's nothing."]
355: 3574| [45] [Natsuhiko swallowed his words.]
356: 3579| [45] [--The words were "Even if people can't come to an understanding, perhaps they can come to a compromise."]
357: 3584| [45] [He did not say it because he thought it might just confuse Salyu again.]
358: 3589| [45] [And then after Salyu stared blankly at Natsuhiko for a while, she suddenly glared at him as if she remembered something.]
359: 3597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
360: 3600| [45] ["... It wasn't anything you needed to thank me for, really."]
361: 3605| [45] [Once Natsuhiko gave that answer, Salyu glared at him.]
362: 3631| [47] [Salyu]
363: 3634| [45] ["That said, I worry about you too, Natsuhiko."]
364: 3639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
365: 3642| [45] ["Huh? Why?"]
366: 3668| [47] [Salyu]
367: 3671| [45] ["The way Mashiro blindly accepted unclear information and the way you're aimlessly chasing after her seem much the same in my perspective."]
368: 3676| [47] [Natsuhiko]
369: 3679| [45] ["Ugh... yeah, that's true."]
370: 3705| [47] [Salyu]
371: 3708| [45] ["It's not like you'll find her by searching blindly."]
372: 3734| [47] [Salyu]
373: 3737| [45] ["So first let's calm down and think about a way to find her. I'll help."]
374: 3742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
375: 3745| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
376: 3750| [45] [Natsuhiko replied enthusiastically to Salyu's proposition.]
