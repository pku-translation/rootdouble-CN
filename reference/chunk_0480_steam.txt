  0:   65| [45] [--It was nine years ago.]
  1:   70| [45] [A memory of when Kazami was 19 years old...]
  2:  111| [45] [A spring breeze caressed her cheeks and rolled across the lawn.]
  3:  116| [45] [Kazami spoke to the girl next to her as they stood in the midst of that warm breeze.]
  4:  121| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  124| [45] ["Nice weather, isn't it, Nagisa?"]
  6:  129| [47] [Nagisa]
  7:  132| [45] ["Sure is, Sis."]
  8:  137| [45] [The one who answered was Kazami's sister, "Nagisa".]
  9:  142| [45] [Today was Kazami's day off, so she went to the park for the first time in ages.]
 10:  147| [45] [She could hear the sounds of children playing in the distance.]
 11:  188| [47] [Boy]
 12:  191| [45] ["Ha, you moved your leg, Mashiro! You lose!"]
 13:  251| [47] [Girl]
 14:  254| [45] ["Hey wait, you sneak attacked me! One more time from the start!"]
 15:  280| [47] [Boy]
 16:  283| [45] ["Heheh, still gonna lose no matter what you do."]
 17:  309| [47] [Girl]
 18:  312| [45] ["What was that--!?"]
 19:  317| [45] [--It appeared a boy and a girl were playing hip sumo.]
 20:  322| [45] [She'd seen the boy before. He was probably one of the kids who lived around this neighborhood.]
 21:  327| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  330| [45] ["Oh look, those kids are about your age. Why don't you go play with them?"]
 23:  408| [47] [Nagisa]
 24:  411| [45] ["N-no... that game looks kinda hard..."]
 25:  416| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  419| [45] ["Oh, that's fine. It'd be better for you to not play any rough games anyway."]
 27:  424| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  427| [45] ["Then why don't we just take a nice little walk?"]
 29:  453| [47] [Nagisa]
 30:  456| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 31:  461| [45] [Kazami took her beaming sister by the hand and broke out into a walk.]
 32:  551| [45] [--Nagisa had been born with a frail body.]
 33:  556| [45] [She didn't have any chronic diseases or anything like that, but she had weak cardiopulmonary function, and she was prone to catching colds and such.]
 34:  561| [45] [That was why they hadn't visited the park in a while.]
 35:  566| [47] [Kazami]
 36:  567| [45] [(I guess she inherited too much from Mother and Father...)]
 37:  572| [45] [The sisters didn't have any parents.]
 38:  577| [45] [They both passed away from cancer-- their mother five years ago, and their father three.]
 39:  582| [45] [Kazami currently worked at a flower shop to support Nagisa.]
 40:  587| [45] [But as they had no family aside from each other, their sisterly bonds were very strong.]
 41:  680| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  683| [45] ["You'll be starting elementary school soon, huh?"]
 43:  709| [47] [Nagisa]
 44:  712| [45] ["Yeah. You think I can make lots of friends?"]
 45:  717| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  720| [45] ["Of course. In that school, definitely."]
 47:  746| [47] [Nagisa]
 48:  749| [45] ["You're right. Eheehee, I'm so excited for it."]
 49:  754| [45] [Seeing Nagisa's smile filled Kazami with joy.]
 50:  825| [45] [Nagisa had only been 3 years old when their father had passed away.]
 51:  830| [45] [It had not been easy for the then-16-year-old Kazami to raise her sister by herself.]
 52:  835| [45] [But it had by no means been a painful experience. For Nagisa was a very kind girl.]
 53:  840| [45] [Her smile always greeted Kazami when she came home from work.]
 54:  845| [45] [It was nigh-therapeutic for Kazami to see such consideration from her sister despite her young age.]
 55:  850| [45] [Nagisa was the most precious treasure that Kazami's parents had left behind for her.]
 56:  925| [45] [Though she was her younger sister, it felt the other way around at the same time.]
 57:  930| [45] [And so Kazami had properly raised her sister until the time had come for her to enter elementary school.]
 58:  935| [45] [Nagisa meant everything to her.]
 59:  940| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  943| [45] ["... By the way, looks like spring's finally started for real now."]
 61:  969| [47] [Nagisa]
 62:  972| [45] ["Yeah, it's so nice and warm out."]
 63:  980| [47] [Nagisa]
 64:  983| [45] ["Why don't we just rest and enjoy the sun, Sis?"]
 65:  988| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  991| [45] ["Now that's a good idea."]
 67:  996| [45] [Kazami and Nagisa laid down in the grass.]
 68: 1080| [47] [Nagisa]
 69: 1083| [45] ["The sky's so pretty~"]
 70: 1088| [47] [Kazami]
 71: 1091| [45] ["Mmm, it feels so nice too."]
 72: 1096| [45] [The spring sunlight shone upon the sisters.]
 73: 1101| [45] [ Kazami thought to herself as she lay engulfed in the warm light.]
 74: 1106| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1107| [45] [(... It's already been three years since I started supporting Nagisa, huh...)]
 76: 1112| [47] [Kazami]
 77: 1113| [45] [(Maybe it was thanks to this city that we were able to make it so far.)]
 78: 1118| [45] [It had already been seven years since Rokumei City had been made a government designated top secret city.]
 79: 1123| [45] [The city's social services had considerably bloomed in that time, allowing Kazami and Nagisa to reap their benefits.]
 80: 1128| [45] [The city had profited immensely from its many science and technology industries (centered around nuclear power and BC)-- and that wealth provided for the sisters.]
 81: 1133| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1134| [45] [(I should be grateful for that... even though I have virtually no aptitude.)]
 83: 1139| [45] [Kazami also had BC aptitude, but very little of it-- she was only "Rank D".]
 84: 1144| [45] [Those at that level could hardly call themselves Communicators-- it pretty much took all their effort to have even the slightest hope of using telepathy.]
 85: 1149| [45] [Kazami couldn't even use telepathy, so she'd never attended Rokumei Academy.]
 86: 1154| [45] [--But there were more important things to worry about.]
 87: 1159| [45] [When she was 12, the city had been swept by a horrible disaster.]
 88: 1164| [45] ["The Great Rokumei City Arson"-- an attack committed by an extremist group who hated Communicators.]
 89: 1169| [45] [The Tachibana family had fortunately been unaffected by the incident, but the facts surrounding it were enough to frighten Kazami.]
 90: 1174| [45] [So to be careful, she had instructed both herself and her sister to not talk about BC very much.]
 91: 1179| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1180| [45] [(But, well, I guess that will have to end soon...)]
 93: 1185| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1186| [45] [(... For Nagisa, at the very least...)]
 95: 1191| [45] [Drowsiness started catching up to her as she idly thought about that.]
 96: 1214| [47] [Kazami]
 97: 1215| [45] [(Oh... oh no. Nagisa will get bored if I fall asleep...)]
 98: 1220| [45] [But she had a hard time staving off the exhaustion that came with having worked hard day after day.]
 99: 1225| [47] [Nagisa]
100: 1228| [45] ["... Oh, Sis? Are you asleep...?"]
101: 1233| [45] [Nagisa's voice also sounded like it was very far away.]
102: 1266| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1267| [45] [(I'm sleepy... no, I mustn't sleep... but I'm sleepy...)]
104: 1272| [45] [Despite her struggle to stay awake, Kazami dozed off.]
105: 1316| [45] [--In the midst of her brief slumber...]
106: 1321| [45] [Kazami had a sad dream.]
107: 1326| [45] [It was about Nagisa going away somewhere.]
108: 1357| [45] [Kazami watched as her sister walked off into the distance, slowly fading into the blinding void...]
109: 1367| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1368| [45] [(Nagisa! Wait, don't go!)]
111: 1373| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1374| [45] [(Don't go! You'll never be able to come back if you do!)]
113: 1379| [45] [She tried to scream aloud, but her voice wouldn't obey her.]
114: 1404| [45] [In spite of that, Nagisa quietly turned around--]
115: 1465| [45] [And smiled at Kazami.]
116: 1532| [47] [Kazami]
117: 1535| [45] ["--Nagisa!"]
118: 1540| [45] [Kazami then woke up.]
119: 1595| [47] [Kazami]
120: 1598| [45] ["H-huh...!? Where's Nagisa!?"]
121: 1603| [45] [Kazami was astonished.]
122: 1608| [45] [She wondered if her dream had become reality for a moment--]
123: 1646| [45] [But when she looked around, she saw Nagisa at a short distance away.]
124: 1651| [45] [Next to her was a local girl named "Jun".]
125: 1656| [45] [It appeared that Nagisa had come across her and the two of them had started playing while Kazami was asleep.]
126: 1661| [47] [Kazami]
127: 1662| [45] [(Oh no, how could I have been so careless!?)]
128: 1674| [45] [Kazami frantically stood up and ran on over to them.]
129: 1764| [47] [Kazami]
130: 1767| [45] ["J-Jun! I'm so sorry you had to watch over Nagisa for me!"]
131: 1793| [47] [Jun]
132: 1796| [45] ["Oh, Kazami. Nah, it's cool, I was having fun too."]
133: 1822| [47] [Nagisa]
134: 1825| [45] ["You were sleeping like a log, Sis, so I didn't wanna wake you up..."]
135: 1876| [47] [Kazami]
136: 1879| [45] ["I can't believe I dozed off like that... It must be because it's so nice and warm today..."]
137: 1884| [45] [Nagisa and Jun laughed at Kazami's embarrassed reaction.]
138: 1889| [47] [Kazami]
139: 1892| [45] ["... Oh my, it looks like it's already past noon now. Why don't we go home and I'll fix you up some lunch?"]
140: 1918| [47] [Nagisa]
141: 1921| [45] ["Yeah! I'm starving!"]
142: 1926| [45] [Kazami then took Nagisa and Jun hand in hand and started heading back to her residence.]
143: 2011| [45] [On their way, Jun sniffed the air and spoke up.]
144: 2037| [47] [Jun]
145: 2040| [45] ["By the way, Kazami, you smell real good, you know?"]
146: 2045| [47] [Kazami]
147: 2048| [45] ["Oh, really? I didn't put any perfume on, though."]
148: 2074| [47] [Jun]
149: 2077| [45] ["But you smell like flowers."]
150: 2082| [45] [Now that Kazami thought about it, Nagisa had told her the same thing before. She hadn't even realized it herself.]
151: 2087| [47] [Kazami]
152: 2090| [45] ["Hmm, perhaps it's because I work around flowers all the time."]
153: 2116| [47] [Nagisa]
154: 2119| [45] ["I bet the smell of flowers is built into your skin now or something. That's wonderful."]
155: 2124| [45] [Kazami smiled at her sister's childish choice of words.]
156: 2129| [45] [It was a mostly trivial, yet warm memory...]
157: 2137| [45] [She believed that this simple peace would last forever...]
