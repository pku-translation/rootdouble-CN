  1:  159| [45] ["You and I will save everyone from this nightmare."]
  2:  164| [45] [But by the time Natsuhiko said that--]
  3:  169| [45] [--Watase had already lost consciousness.]
  4:  177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  180| [45] ["Hey, c'mon! This is no time to sleep! Wake up!"]
  6:  185| [45] [But no matter how many times he tried to rouse him from his slumber, Watase did not awaken.]
  7:  190| [45] [On the contrary.]
  8:  237| [45] [He began to froth from the mouth and convulse.]
  9:  245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  248| [45] ["H-hey!? What's wrong!?"]
 11:  253| [45] [No response. There was clearly something wrong with him.]
 12:  258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  259| [45] [(What's going on!? Is it because Ms. Tachibana struck him!?)]
 14:  265| [45] [As that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, he began to hear the whirring of the gigantic machine surrounding him.]
 15:  324| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  325| [45] [(No, is this machine to blame!?)]
 17:  395| [45] [Natsuhiko slipped the Procyon out of Watase's pocket.]
 18:  406| [45] [When he switched it on,]
 19:  432| [45] [the reading spiked to "13492 mSv".]
 20:  437| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  438| [45] [(!! That's huge!)]
 22:  443| [45] [According to the "WX particle amplifier" manual, values over 8000 mSv can cause symptoms including unconsciousness.]
 23:  490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  491| [45] [(And it's about time for Watase's AD to wear off...)]
 25:  496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  497| [45] [(If this machine's dispersing harmful particles, then could his unconsciousness and convulsions be due to that!?)]
 27:  502| [45] [But-- if that were the case, then why was Natsuhiko okay?]
 28:  507| [45] [He didn't particularly feel a headache. His gunshot wounds hurt, but he managed to keep standing.]
 29:  512| [45] [Natsuhiko's condition had improved thanks to Watase and Kazami's treatment.]
 30:  517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  518| [45] [(It's far from a complete recovery... but it's not like I have to keep myself wormed into someone else's mind to stay alive anymore.)]
 32:  523| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  524| [45] [(On the other hand, Watase looks like he's in danger here. I gotta get him out of Area N!)]
 34:  567| [45] [Right when he thought that, he caught sight of a certain something in the corner of his eye:]
 35:  577| [45] [A security card split in two.]
 36:  582| [45] [It was the "Lv. N" card that Natsuhiko had at one point that Watase had snapped.]
 37:  587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  588| [45] [(Can it... still be used?)]
 39:  593| [45] [When he picked up both halves, he noticed that the part that was swiped through the slot reader was apparently still intact.]
 40:  638| [45] [He put the card fragment in his pocket, wedged his blood transfusion kit under his arm, and grabbed Watase's hand.]
 41:  646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  649| [45] ["Khh... heave!!"]
 43:  698| [45] [He thus started dragging Watase across the floor.]
 44:  703| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  704| [45] [(Can't go towards Area 2... Ms. Tachibana's on the other side.)]
 46:  709| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  710| [45] [(Areas 1 and 3 are dangerous too. We could very well run into Mr. Ukita or Jun.)]
 48:  715| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  716| [45] [(And Areas 4 and 5 are contaminated in their inner rings... so that narrows our options down to just Area 6.)]
 50:  722| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko desperately dragged Watase.]
 51:  727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  728| [45] [(Damn he's heavy... Just how many kilos does he weigh?)]
 53:  733| [45] [Judging by his physique, he must've been nearly 90 kg.]
 54:  749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  752| [45] ["Ugh... ghh....!"]
 56:  765| [45] [The more strength he used, the more his entire body hurt.]
 57:  770| [45] [The gunshot wound in his arm opened up and seeped with blood.]
 58:  783| [45] [And Natsuhiko was now trying to save the one who inflicted that very wound upon him.]
 59:  857| [45] [He dragged him further and brought him into the connecting passageway.]
 60:  928| [45] [And once he finally reached Area 6--]
 61:  992| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  995| [45] ["Damn... it... I can't... keep this up...!"]
 63: 1022| [45] [--Natsuhiko collapsed on the spot, his strength shot.]
 64: 1027| [45] [He'd used up what little stamina he had regained. He tried to catch his breath.]
 65: 1032| [45] [His body felt too heavy to be his own. It was too much of a bother to even sit up.]
 66: 1037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1038| [45] [(But... it should be fairly safe now that we've gotten this far away, right?)]
 68: 1104| [45] [He checked the Procyon. The reading had dropped to "3911 mSv".]
 69: 1109| [45] [A value quite lower than what it had been when Watase had gone to Area 6 before.]
 70: 1114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1115| [45] [(... Hmm!? Now that I think about it, that's the first time I've seen the reading decrease, isn't it?)]
 72: 1120| [45] [The readings had always been rising, but it was only after they'd come this far that he finally saw a reading decrease.]
 73: 1125| [45] [He didn't know why that was, but--]
 74: 1139| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1140| [45] [(For now, I guess we should be thankful... both me and Watase.)]
 76: 1148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1151| [45] ["Hey, Watase... feeling a little better now?"]
 78: 1156| [45] [Right after he called out to Watase, Natsuhiko suddenly noticed something.]
 79: 1161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1162| [45] [(Wait... If I called him casually by his first name like that, he'd definitely think it was strange.)]
 81: 1167| [45] [Natsuhiko adjusted his tone and addressed him more formally.]
 82: 1175| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1178| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, please wake up...!"]
 84: 1186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1189| [45] ["Can you hear me, Captain? Captain Kasasagi!"]
 86: 1194| [45] [Natsuhiko kept calling out to him--]
 87: 1199| [45] [--and eventually Watase weakly began to move.]
