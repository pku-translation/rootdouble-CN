  1:   53| [47] [Watase]
  2:   54| [45] [(This isn't normal...!)]
  3:   59| [45] [His inner doubts began rapidly piling up.]
  4:   64| [45] [Something was off. Something about this wasn't right.]
  5:   69| [47] [Watase]
  6:   70| [45] [(What is it? Did Yuuri do something to me?)]
  7:   75| [47] [Watase]
  8:   76| [45] [(----!?)]
  9:   81| [47] [Watase]
 10:   82| [45] [("Did Yuuri do something to me"? What the hell's wrong with me!?)]
 11:   87| [45] [Watase was confused by his own baseless thoughts.]
 12:   92| [45] [Just then, a memory flashed through his brain--]
 13:  188| [45] [A memory of a mere few minutes ago.]
 14:  196| [47] [Yuuri]
 15:  199| [45] ["--...--...--...--"]
 16:  204| [45] [He'd found Yuuri in the elevator hall. She'd been saying something to him.]
 17:  209| [45] [But oddly enough, he couldn't remember what it was.]
 18:  214| [45] [Yuuri eventually walked over towards him calmly--]
 19:  284| [45] [--and that was it. Everything after that had up and vanished.]
 20:  289| [45] [No, that wasn't it. Even the memory Watase had just remembered was a "total mystery" to him.]
 21:  294| [47] [Watase]
 22:  295| [45] [(Wha... I lost that memory without even being aware of it...?)]
 23:  300| [47] [Watase]
 24:  301| [45] [(No way, could that have happened when my memories got muddled up a minute ago...!?)]
 25:  306| [45] [But there was one other thing he didn't understand.]
 26:  311| [45] [Why had Yuuri been so calm when she was hanging around in a contaminated zone?]
 27:  316| [45] [A mysterious anxiety burst into Watase's heart.]
 28:  321| [47] [Watase]
 29:  322| [45] [(Could it be... that Yuuri isn't affected by radiation...?)]
 30:  327| [45] [Even he knew that was an utterly insane idea.]
 31:  332| [45] [But something inside Watase was asserting that belief.]
 32:  337| [47] [Watase]
 33:  338| [45] [(If she's immune to radiation--)]
 34:  343| [45] [And the fact that there was a blank in Watase's memories of the previous time he'd been in the elevator hall meant--!]
 35:  348| [47] [Watase]
 36:  349| [45] [(--Could Yuuri still be lurking around in the contaminated zone!?)]
 37:  354| [45] [Watase came to that conclusion and quickly backtracked to B2.]
 38:  403| [45] [He suffered a horrific headache the moment he returned to the contaminated zone.]
 39:  408| [45] [Watase then became sure of it:]
 40:  413| [45] [There was no way a frail girl like Yuuri could have ever put up with a headache like that.]
 41:  418| [47] [Watase]
 42:  419| [45] [(Then that means she really is...!)]
 43:  424| [47] [Watase]
 44:  425| [45] [(But if that's the case, then what in the world -is- Yuuri...!?)]
 45:  430| [45] [If there really was a person unaffected by radiation, then they were probably something not human.]
 46:  479| [47] [Watase]
 47:  480| [45] [(--Remember!)]
 48:  485| [45] [Watase kept on commanding himself to remember with all his might as he searched the contaminated zone.]
 49:  490| [45] [He felt that the answer lied somewhere in his vanished memories.]
 50:  495| [45] [His headache grew much worse at that very moment.]
 51:  500| [45] [But Watase gritted his teeth and desperately searched his memories.]
 52:  574| [47] [Watase]
 53:  575| [45] [(That's right... I found Yuuri in the elevator hall back then...)]
 54:  580| [47] [Watase]
 55:  581| [45] [(She then stretched her palm out to me, and then...)]
 56:  709| [47] [Watase]
 57:  710| [45] [(That's right... I got scared...!)]
 58:  715| [47] [Watase]
 59:  716| [45] [(Because I saw Yuuri... and that monster... as one and the same...!)]
 60:  721| [45] [Watase remembered that-- but just then...]
 61:  798| [47] [Watase]
 62:  801| [45] ["Ghh, agh..."]
 63:  878| [47] [Watase]
 64:  881| [45] ["GAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHH!"]
 65:  886| [45] [Watase held his head and screamed.]
 66:  891| [45] [His brain was being assaulted by a head-splitting headache.]
 67:  896| [45] [It was at that moment that Watase remembered...]
 68:  901| [45] [... that he'd been experiencing the same kind of agony just a short while ago.]
 69:  906| [47] [Watase]
 70:  907| [45] [(This is the radiation's--!!)]
 71:  912| [45] [But by the time he realized it, it was too late.]
 72:  917| [45] [The pain churned the inside of his brain. His brain itself hit its limit, and his brain cells tore apart.]
 73:  922| [45] [--I'm breaking apart!]
 74:  999| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1002| [45] ["OWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"]
 76: 1007| [45] [He couldn't stop screaming.]
 77: 1012| [45] [He heard the sound of his capillaries snapping apart in his head.]
 78: 1017| [45] [Blood then poured out of his nose.]
 79: 1067| [45] [His eyes and ears then suffered the same fate--!]
 80: 1072| [45] [But suddenly--]
 81: 1121| [45] [--everything vanished from Watase's world.]
 82: 1126| [45] [From light, to sound, to his screams, and even the pain ravishing his brain.]
 83: 1131| [45] [That's right, everything...]
 84: 1136| [45] [... even the memories that made Watase who he was...]
 85: 1141| [45] [Vanished.]
 86: 1146| [45] [Disappeared into thin air.]
 87: 1151| [45] [Became indecipherable.]
 88: 1156| [45] [No, there was one thing that was clear.]
 89: 1161| [45] [His brain had been completely destroyed.]
 90: 1166| [45] [And then-- his world became one of nothingness.]
