  0:   67| [45] [--A year after she told Kazami of her desire to enlist in Sirius--]
  1:   72| [45] [Jun followed through with her plans, first by enrolling in firefighting school.]
  2:   77| [45] [She graduated at the top of her class, above all the boys who were there.]
  3:   82| [45] [She probably had the talent for it to begin with. But becoming a member of Sirius was far more difficult than becoming a firefighter.]
  4:   87| [45] [As a result, Kazami, who had overcome many obstacles to become a rescue worker, was like an idol for the female firefighters of the Rokumei City Fire Department.]
  5:  108| [47] [Jun]
  6:  109| [45] [(I have to do my best so I can be just like Sis!)]
  7:  114| [47] [Jun]
  8:  115| [45] [(So what if I'm a shrimp!? What matters is effort, guts, and spirit!)]
  9:  120| [45] [She kept training every day to compensate for her small body.]
 10:  125| [45] [Her peers were astounded by how she worked herself to the bone.]
 11:  130| [45] [By the time she could bench press 90 kg, do 250 pushups, and run 1500 m in five minutes--]
 12:  135| [45] [No more obstacles remained in her path.]
 13:  140| [45] [And thus the second female rescue worker in the Rokumei City Fire Department's history was born.]
 14:  194| [45] [--Jun enlisted in Sirius on August 1, 2030, where she was incorporated into the Tachibana party of Team A, commanded by Watase Kasasagi.]
 15:  199| [45] [She then easily completed several dispatches, waiting for the opportunity to truly shine.]
 16:  260| [45] [It wasn't long before that opportunity came knocking.]
 17:  265| [45] [--September 16, early morning.]
 18:  270| [45] [Just when Jun's night shift was nearing its end--]
 19:  331| [45] [The ear-splitting scream of a dispatch siren screeched through the station.]
 20:  336| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have occurred in the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization."]
 21:  341| [45] [And with that ominous report--]
 22:  347| [45] [The curtain rose on the longest day of Jun's life.]
 23:  408| [45] [Jun and the others hurried on over to the dispatch site via helicopter after receiving the report.]
 24:  413| [45] [They received their orders from their commander, and LABO's staff provided them with AD and Procyons.]
 25:  419| [45] [The group was split into two teams before they entered the facility-- Team A and Team B.]
 26:  470| [45] [Team A lined up in LABO's entrance hall before Watase, who proceeded to give them instructions.]
 27:  478| [47] [Watase]
 28:  481| [45] ["Countless people are trapped in this lab as we speak!"]
 29:  489| [47] [Watase]
 30:  492| [45] ["And due to the nature of this facility, this will be no ordinary dispatch."]
 31:  500| [47] [Watase]
 32:  503| [45] ["We don't know what will happen here, nor what unforeseen circumstances await us."]
 33:  526| [47] [Jun]
 34:  529| [45] ["..."]
 35:  534| [47] [Jun]
 36:  535| [45] [(Unforeseen circumstances...!)]
 37:  540| [45] [Radiation exposure, radiation damage, and death-- those phrases all clouded her head.]
 38:  545| [45] [This was the first "N disaster" that Jun-- no, that the whole Rokumei City Fire Department-- had encountered. There was a possibility that a meltdown actually would happen.]
 39:  550| [47] [Jun]
 40:  551| [45] [(But I can't wuss out...!)]
 41:  556| [47] [Jun]
 42:  557| [45] [(I have to protect Sis! C'mon, put some spirit into it, Jun!)]
 43:  562| [45] [New orders from the commander and a map of floors 1 and 2 were sent to Jun just as she finished steeling her resolve.]
 44:  570| [47] [Watase]
 45:  573| [45] ["... According to what the Commander has been able to learn so far, all the researchers in the basement have already evacuated."]
 46:  581| [47] [Watase]
 47:  584| [45] ["The only ones still trapped are on the surface floors. That's where we will conduct rescue efforts."]
 48:  592| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  595| [45] ["Yes!"]
 50:  603| [47] [Watase]
 51:  606| [45] ["Form two-man cells! Tachibana, you're with Moribe! Dojima, you're with Hiyama!"]
 52:  614| [47] [Watase]
 53:  617| [45] ["Make sure to keep in constant contact with Team B! Don't forget this!"]
 54:  625| [47] [Watase]
 55:  628| [45] ["All right, get to work, people!"]
 56:  636| [47] [Jun]
 57:  639| [45] ["Sir, yes sir!"]
 58:  710| [45] [Jun ran off with Kazami.]
 59:  715| [45] [They were equipped with the minimum gear necessary-- air tanks, a rope, and an engine cutter.]
 60:  764| [45] [--The search of the surface floors went smoothly.]
 61:  769| [45] [There were no signs of fire on floors 1 and 2, so the evacuation of the survivors was smoothly completed.]
 62:  836| [47] [Kazami]
 63:  839| [45] ["Floor 2, Area 2, clear."]
 64:  847| [47] [Jun]
 65:  850| [45] ["That means we're all done with our search territory, right!?"]
 66:  858| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  861| [45] ["Yes. Let's head back to the command post."]
 68:  869| [47] [Jun]
 69:  872| [45] ["Roger!"]
 70:  923| [45] [They'd lost contact with Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama a little while back.]
 71:  928| [45] [So they planned to go back to the command post to check if they were all right... but then Kazami suddenly came to a halt.]
 72:  954| [47] [Kazami]
 73:  957| [45] ["...!?"]
 74:  965| [47] [Jun]
 75:  968| [45] ["What's wrong, Lieutenant?"]
 76:  976| [47] [Kazami]
 77:  979| [45] ["I thought I just heard someone's voice..."]
 78:  985| [45] [Kazami looked down the stairs. It went down to the basement floors.]
 79:  990| [47] [Jun]
 80:  991| [45] [(But didn't they say they already finished evacuating the basement?)]
 81:  996| [45] [Just as she thought that-- Kazami gasped.]
 82: 1006| [47] [Kazami]
 83: 1009| [45] ["Ah!"]
 84: 1014| [45] [Jun then heard a voice coming from the basement.]
 85: 1022| [47] [???]
 86: 1025| [45] ["Hey, you! Over here, over here!"]
 87: 1030| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1031| [45] [(!?)]
 89: 1036| [45] [For a moment, Jun couldn't help but feel she'd heard that voice somewhere before.]
 90: 1047| [45] [They then heard footsteps running off somewhere.]
 91: 1061| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1064| [45] ["Wh-what was that!?"]
 93: 1072| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1075| [45] ["I don't know! It appears to have come from the basement...!"]
 95: 1083| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1086| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 97: 1091| [45] [That was odd. There wasn't supposed to be anyone down there according to the commander.]
 98: 1138| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1139| [45] [(Did some people go down to the basement after the fire broke out!?)]
100: 1144| [47] [Jun]
101: 1145| [45] [(Why!? Why would they do that!? To get some top-secret data or something!?)]
102: 1150| [45] [She didn't know why they would go down after the fire or why they would run away from them.]
103: 1183| [45] [But one thing was absolutely clear--]
104: 1191| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1194| [45] ["Moribe! There are still people in the basement!"]
106: 1202| [47] [Jun]
107: 1205| [45] ["Khh... l-let's go, Lieutenant!"]
108: 1216| [45] [Though neither of them had a clue what was going on, they both headed down to the basement.]
109: 1273| [45] [But there was no one to be found anymore at B2.]
110: 1281| [47] [Jun]
111: 1284| [45] ["No one's here!? Why!?"]
112: 1318| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1321| [45] ["Let's look for them! They couldn't have gotten far!"]
114: 1357| [45] [Jun and Kazami ran through Area 2, looking for the survivors.]
115: 1412| [45] [--But they were nowhere to be seen.]
116: 1417| [45] [They tried looking in Area 1 too, but no one was there.]
117: 1499| [45] [They reluctantly decided to head back to the surface,]
118: 1551| [45] [but the Area 1 staircase was destroyed in a series of explosions.]
119: 1614| [45] [They tried looking for another way up, but their path was blocked with flames.]
120: 1622| [47] [Jun]
121: 1625| [45] ["Lieutenant, there's another fire here!"]
122: 1658| [47] [Kazami]
123: 1661| [45] ["Wait, Moribe! It's too much for you to handle by yourself!"]
124: 1669| [47] [Jun]
125: 1672| [45] ["But we've gotta put out this fire first or we're in trouble!"]
126: 1694| [45] [Jun took a fire hose and stood before the hallway--]
127: 1874| [45] [When her vision was filled with a jet of flames spurting from the fire--!]
128: 1882| [47] [Kazami]
129: 1885| [45] ["Jun, look out!"]
130: 1966| [45] [--Kazami saved Jun in the nick of time.]
131: 1971| [45] [But their protection suits were damaged in the process, rendering them unusable.]
132: 1976| [45] [Despite that setback, they just removed the suits and continued the search as they fought fires.]
133: 1981| [45] [All while fearing the meltdown that could happen any moment.]
134: 2050| [47] [Jun]
135: 2053| [45] ["Let's go back, Lieutenant! There's a big chance the survivors ran towards Area 3!"]
136: 2061| [47] [Kazami]
137: 2064| [45] ["Of course!"]
138: 2085| [45] [Jun and Kazami then returned to Area 2--]
139: 2100| [45] [just as an ominous siren suddenly bellowed.]
140: 2184| [47] [Jun]
141: 2187| [45] ["Uwah!?"]
142: 2213| [47] [Kazami]
143: 2216| [45] ["Wh-what's that!?"]
144: 2221| [45] [The loud alarm was accompanied by an automatic PA announcement.]
145: 2226| [47] [Automatic PA]
146: 2229| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
147: 2234| [47] [Automatic PA]
148: 2237| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
149: 2242| [47] [Automatic PA]
150: 2245| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
151: 2268| [47] [Automatic PA]
152: 2271| [45] ["All facility personnel, please administer AD, take shelter in the nearest room, and stay in place."]
153: 2276| [45] [Jun looked at the connecting passageway in shock.]
154: 2380| [45] [The security gate in their way-- closed with a loud boom.]
155: 2457| [47] [Kazami]
156: 2460| [45] ["--No way!?"]
157: 2474| [45] [Kazami ran up to the gate and tried opening it.]
158: 2555| [45] [But no matter how much she tried to use the opening mechanism or how much strength she used, the gate wouldn't budge.]
159: 2581| [47] [Kazami]
160: 2584| [45] ["This is horrible...!"]
161: 2592| [47] [Jun]
162: 2595| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this!?"]
163: 2657| [47] [Kazami]
164: 2660| [45] ["I do not know why, but it appears 'Evacuation Mode' has ended..."]
165: 2668| [47] [Kazami]
166: 2671| [45] ["All of the gates that were open up until this point are now locked."]
167: 2679| [47] [Jun]
168: 2682| [45] ["Th-then...!"]
169: 2708| [47] [Kazami]
170: 2711| [45] ["Yes. It seems we have been trapped inside this block...!"]
171: 2716| [45] [Jun started shuddering at Kazami's statement.]
172: 2724| [47] [Jun]
173: 2727| [45] ["T-trapped...!? Wh-what are we gonna do!?"]
174: 2753| [47] [Kazami]
175: 2756| [45] ["What, you ask? We only have one choice."]
176: 2764| [47] [Kazami]
177: 2767| [45] ["We continue with the search. There's a high probability that the survivors have also been trapped."]
178: 2790| [47] [Jun]
179: 2793| [45] ["...!"]
180: 2819| [47] [Kazami]
181: 2822| [45] ["Once we've concluded the search, we shall secure an escape route. Actually, wait, we have to find a security card before we can do that."]
182: 2830| [47] [Kazami]
183: 2833| [45] ["There is much we have to do. We do not have time to be standing around."]
184: 2841| [47] [Jun]
185: 2844| [45] ["I-I know, but..."]
186: 2852| [47] [Jun]
187: 2855| [45] ["How can you be so calm...!?"]
188: 2863| [47] [Jun]
189: 2866| [45] ["Don't you realize we're stuck in the basement of a nuclear research facility without protection suits!?"]
190: 2892| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2895| [45] ["I am calm precisely because panicking will not change our situation for the better. You must keep a cool head in any situation to accomplish all necessary tasks at hand."]
192: 2921| [47] [Kazami]
193: 2924| [45] ["Also... you'd get scared if I panicked, right?"]
194: 2947| [47] [Jun]
195: 2950| [45] ["--"]
196: 2955| [45] [Jun gasped at how simply Kazami had seen through her. The lieutenant then continued in a teasing voice.]
197: 2981| [47] [Kazami]
198: 2984| [45] ["It's because you are still a greenhorn. The team would fall apart if I were unable to uphold my dignity as a veteran."]
199: 2992| [47] [Jun]
200: 2995| [45] ["H-hey! Don't treat me like a kid! I'm not scared at all!"]
201: 3021| [47] [Kazami]
202: 3024| [45] ["Are you sure about that?"]
203: 3032| [47] [Jun]
204: 3035| [45] ["Hell yes I am. I'm a member of Sirius too, y'know!"]
205: 3040| [45] [Kazami smiled at Jun's words.]
206: 3066| [47] [Kazami]
207: 3069| [45] ["... Good, keep up that attitude and you'll be fine."]
208: 3095| [47] [Kazami]
209: 3098| [45] ["Well, if anything -were- to happen, I'd protect you, so don't worry."]
210: 3106| [47] [Jun]
211: 3109| [45] ["... That's my line!"]
212: 3117| [47] [Jun]
213: 3120| [45] ["So let's work together, rescue the survivors... then find a way out for sure, okay?"]
214: 3147| [45] [Jun and Kazami exchanged a firm handshake.]
215: 3158| [45] [They then walked off with strength in their step.]
216: 3209| [45] [--Jun and Kazami found two Level 2 security cards after that.]
217: 3214| [45] [They used those to search for an escape route and survivors as they put out the fires in the facility.]
218: 3219| [45] [But they weren't able to find either. And just as they were about to finish searching Areas 2 and 1--]
219: 3274| [47] [Jun]
220: 3277| [45] ["... Ah! That's--"]
221: 3310| [47] [Kazami]
222: 3313| [45] ["Is that the Captain!?"]
223: 3318| [45] [They found Watase lying in a hallway in Area 1.]
224: 3323| [45] [The three rescue workers then began their long and arduous battle through the facility...]
