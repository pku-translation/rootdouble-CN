  1:   61| [45] [The team took a quick look through Area 5 just to be safe, then moved on to the factory.]
  2:  105| [45] [--The large, messy room was as still as a grave.]
  3:  113| [47] [Watase]
  4:  116| [45] ["No one here from what I can see..."]
  5:  193| [47] [Ukita]
  6:  196| [45] ["But there's also a possibility that Yuuri went running this way."]
  7:  222| [47] [Jun]
  8:  225| [45] ["Yeah, and we've also gotta find anything that can help us locate an escape route."]
  9:  251| [47] [Jun]
 10:  254| [45] ["Time's a wasting, so let's all search quickly."]
 11:  259| [45] [It was just as Jun said.]
 12:  264| [45] [Just because they'd found a ton of AD didn't change the fact they were short on time.]
 13:  269| [47] [Watase]
 14:  270| [45] [(We need to be more careful to make sure we don't waste any time from this point onwards...)]
 15:  275| [45] [As he thought to himself, Watase finally entered the factory.]
 16:  335| [45] [--Just then, something caught his eye.]
 17:  340| [47] [Watase]
 18:  341| [45] ["..."]
 19:  346| [45] [It was the security gate in the corner.]
 20:  351| [45] [Behind it was that small room with the emergency lift, the one where they'd found the body of that girl.]
 21:  379| [47] [Jun]
 22:  382| [45] ["Hmm? Hey Captain, something wrong?"]
 23:  390| [47] [Watase]
 24:  393| [45] ["Oh, well, it's just, about that cargo lift... I was wondering if there was any way we could still use it to get out of here."]
 25:  419| [47] [Jun]
 26:  422| [45] ["Huh? But the control panel's totally busted, right?"]
 27:  430| [47] [Watase]
 28:  433| [45] ["But I was just wondering if maybe we could repair it and use it to get the surface.%NThat sound feasible, old man?"]
 29:  460| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  463| [45] ["Mmm... I don't feel confident enough to pull that off."]
 31:  468| [45] [Now that he mentioned it, Ukita had failed to repair that security slot earlier.]
 32:  476| [47] [Watase]
 33:  479| [45] ["But this is the only escape route we know about, so I think it's still worth a try, wouldn't you say?"]
 34:  505| [47] [Jun]
 35:  508| [45] ["True. I'm good at handiwork, so maybe it'll just be a simple repair job."]
 36:  534| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  537| [45] ["I see... then let's leave this up to Moribe."]
 38:  545| [47] [Watase]
 39:  548| [45] ["Then it's settled. Let's go, guys."]
 40:  553| [45] [The three then headed off to the cargo lift room together.]
 41:  648| [45] [--The girl's body was still there, exactly the way they'd left it.]
 42:  653| [47] [Watase]
 43:  654| [45] ["..."]
 44:  659| [45] [The team looked at her and offered a silent prayer, then walked up to the control panel.]
 45:  727| [47] [Jun]
 46:  730| [45] ["Okay then, let's see if I can fix this sucker..."]
 47:  735| [45] [Jun took her army knife out.]
 48:  743| [47] [Watase]
 49:  746| [45] ["Then I'll go check the shaft while you're doing that. Sound good?"]
 50:  772| [47] [Jun]
 51:  775| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 52:  783| [47] [Watase]
 53:  786| [45] ["Maybe there a ladder or something in there we can use to climb up the shaft.%NYou know, like the other elevators."]
 54:  812| [47] [Jun]
 55:  815| [45] ["Oh, I get it."]
 56:  841| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  844| [45] ["What should I do?"]
 58:  852| [47] [Watase]
 59:  855| [45] ["Hmm... I'm sorry, but I'd like you to search the factory itself."]
 60:  863| [47] [Watase]
 61:  866| [45] ["I know you just searched it a little while ago, but let's just try to play it safe."]
 62:  892| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  895| [45] ["Mmm... very well."]
 64:  915| [45] [Ukita then left the room.]
 65:  941| [47] [Jun]
 66:  944| [45] ["Okay then, ready to go to work?"]
 67:  952| [47] [Watase]
 68:  955| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 69: 1015| [45] [Watase nodded and ran over to the lift doors.]
 70: 1020| [45] [He placed his hands on the slide between them and put all his might into his arms.]
 71: 1028| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1031| [45] ["Mmph!!"]
 73: 1082| [45] [He then tried to open it up--]
 74: 1087| [45] [But unlike the normal elevator doors, these ones didn't budge an inch.]
 75: 1095| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1098| [45] ["Mmm, looks like it's locked..."]
 77: 1126| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1129| [45] ["But we'll be able to open them if I fix the control panel."]
 79: 1137| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1140| [45] ["I'll be doing the repairs, so how 'bout you help Mr. Ukita out?"]
 81: 1205| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1208| [45] ["Yeah, that sounds good."]
 83: 1234| [47] [Jun]
 84: 1237| [45] ["I'll call you over when I'm done, so just wait a bit, okay?"]
 85: 1249| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1252| [45] ["No, hold on... then why don't I take over the repairs instead?"]
 87: 1278| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1281| [45] ["Huh? But you've got amnesia. Can you really do that?"]
 89: 1289| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1292| [45] ["Only one way to find out. Maybe I've still got my muscle memory."]
 91: 1318| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1321| [45] ["That doesn't sound very reliable, but... okay then, I'll stand here and let you try for a while."]
 93: 1329| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1332| [45] ["... Doesn't sound like you have much faith in me, huh? Well, just you watch."]
 95: 1365| [45] [Watase nodded and took the army knife from Jun.]
 96: 1376| [45] [--But after fiddling around with the control panel for about three minutes--]
 97: 1381| [45] [Watase concluded that it didn't seem like he could repair it at all.]
 98: 1389| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1392| [45] ["Mmm... nope, I don't have a clue how to do this."]
100: 1397| [45] [He could tell that some parts weren't wired properly, but he hadn't the slightest idea how to repair them.]
101: 1423| [47] [Jun]
102: 1426| [45] ["Didn't I tell you? And I'm not trying to be rude, but that was a waste of time."]
103: 1434| [47] [Jun]
104: 1437| [45] ["Just leave this to me and go help Mr. Ukita."]
105: 1495| [47] [Watase]
106: 1498| [45] ["... Guess that's all I -can- do for now. Okay."]
107: 1524| [47] [Jun]
108: 1527| [45] ["I'll call you over when I'm done, so just wait a bit, okay?"]
109: 1544| [55] [√After Chapter 4]
110: 1552| [45] [Watase nodded and left the room.]
111: 1677| [45] [He soon found Ukita in the factory.]
112: 1735| [45] [The latter flinched when he noticed Watase.]
113: 1763| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1766| [45] ["Wh-what's wrong? How'd the inspection of the shaft go?"]
115: 1774| [47] [Watase]
116: 1777| [45] ["I couldn't open the doors. So I came to help you search the place."]
117: 1803| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1806| [45] ["... I see."]
119: 1811| [45] [Ukita looked away in what appeared to be irritation.]
120: 1816| [47] [Watase]
121: 1817| [45] [(What's his problem...? Is he still bothered by our argument earlier?)]
122: 1822| [45] [That thought worried Watase.]
123: 1865| [45] [He searched the factory, trying to give Ukita some space.]
124: 1870| [45] [--The two then silently searched the factory for a while--]
125: 1875| [45] [Only for that silence to be abruptly broken by the echo of Jun's voice.]
126: 1883| [47] [Jun]
127: 1886| [45] ["Captain! Mr. Ukita!"]
128: 1891| [45] [The pair looked to find Jun running over to them from the cargo lift room.]
129: 1968| [47] [Watase]
130: 1971| [45] ["What's up?"]
131: 1979| [47] [Ukita]
132: 1982| [45] ["Are you done fixing the lift?"]
133: 2008| [47] [Jun]
134: 2011| [45] ["Sorry, it was a no-go. I just don't have enough parts to fix it."]
135: 2019| [47] [Watase]
136: 2022| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
137: 2048| [47] [Jun]
138: 2051| [45] ["The parts I need are just gone. Like the internal wiring was ripped out or something.%NIt would take a lot of time and effort just to fix it."]
139: 2059| [47] [Watase]
140: 2062| [45] ["I see... whoever broke it sure thought things through, that's for sure."]
141: 2088| [47] [Jun]
142: 2091| [45] ["So what now? We could try taking apart the nearby machines to whip up the right wiring or parts for something like this, but..."]
143: 2099| [47] [Watase]
144: 2102| [45] ["Would that take a while?"]
145: 2128| [47] [Jun]
146: 2131| [45] ["I'll be honest: I have no clue how long that'd take. I don't know if we have the right kind of parts on hand."]
147: 2136| [45] [Ukita then picked that moment to cut in.]
148: 2162| [47] [Ukita]
149: 2165| [45] ["No... I believe it'd be better for us to go find the survivors first if our other option is betting on an admittedly unstable factor."]
150: 2173| [47] [Watase]
151: 2176| [45] ["Hmm, what to do... honestly, I do think the old man's point is valid."]
152: 2202| [47] [Jun]
153: 2205| [45] ["Yeah. It'd be a whole 'nother story if this were a regular dispatch, but here, the longer it takes for us to find them, the more the survivors' cumulative exposure increases."]
154: 2213| [47] [Watase]
155: 2216| [45] ["Okay... then let's consider the whole lift thing again after we've found the survivors."]
156: 2224| [47] [Jun]
157: 2227| [45] ["Yeah! Okay, now that we're done searching the factory, let's move on to the inner ring!"]
158: 2253| [47] [Ukita]
159: 2256| [45] ["Roger."]
160: 2261| [45] [The team then headed for the inner ring.]
