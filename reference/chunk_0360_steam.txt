  0:   68| [45] [--Salyu stayed in a hotel on her first day in Rokumei City.]
  1:   73| [45] [There, she received an informative lecture on the usage of ARMS and various points of caution relating to her new life.]
  2:   78| [45] [The next morning, Dr. Tenkawa took her from the hotel to the school.]
  3:  116| [45] [The circumstances were unclear, but according to the professor, Rokumei Academy was the only school that would admit Salyu.]
  4:  121| [45] [It was a little disheartening to stand in front of the school. Dr. Tenkawa had accompanied her all the way to the school gate, but Salyu was on her own from there on.]
  5:  170| [47] [Salyu]
  6:  171| [45] [(I don't know if this will go well...)]
  7:  176| [45] [As Salyu nervously waited in front of the classroom, she was addressed by the homeroom teacher who greeted her earlier.]
  8:  181| [47] [Ena]
  9:  184| [45] ["Indeed she is. Now then, Ms. Sannomiya, please come in~"]
 10:  189| [45] [Salyu fired herself up and entered the classroom as instructed.]
 11:  315| [47] [Ena]
 12:  318| [45] ["Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself now."]
 13:  323| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  326| [45] ["Louise Yui Sannomiya."]
 15:  331| [45] [--And thus, she somehow managed to handle the hurdle of introducing herself.]
 16:  374| [45] [But Salyu was afraid of the crowd of students in the classroom.]
 17:  444| [45] [And once homeroom ended--]
 18:  536| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  539| [45] ["Hey, bonjour! Mademoiselle Louise?"]
 20:  544| [45] [An energetic girl called out to her.]
 21:  550| [45] [The sudden voice startled Salyu.]
 22:  555| [45] [It was "Mashiro Toba". She said she wanted to be Salyu's friend.]
 23:  560| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  561| [45] [(... Really? I hope she's not plotting anything.)]
 25:  566| [45] [Salyu sank into paranoia for a second before suddenly realizing something important:%Nthis girl seemed to be that "friend of Natsuhiko's" that the professor mentioned.]
 26:  571| [45] [Natsuhiko himself was nearby. In that case, Salyu thought it'd be best for her to make friends with them.]
 27:  576| [45] [Once Salyu agreed to be their friend, Mashiro jumped for joy.]
 28:  584| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  587| [45] ["Now, then, what should we call you?"]
 30:  595| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  598| [45] ["Oh, I know! 'Salyu'. How's that!?"]
 32:  603| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  606| [45] ["Hmm... well, I don't see why not."]
 34:  611| [47] [Salyu]
 35:  612| [45] [(Actually... it's a rather beautiful nickname.)]
 36:  617| [45] ["Salyu" was pronounced like "Salut", which was French for "hi".]
 37:  622| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  623| [45] [(A salutation. The beginning of communication... It's like an encouraging boost to my perseverance.)]
 39:  628| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  629| [45] [(I feel like my first contact with them went by pretty well too.)]
 41:  634| [45] [Salyu was secretly full of joy.]
 42:  639| [45] [And thus began her new life.]
 43:  735| [45] [--But the day's lessons ended before she really had any good opportunities to have a nice and slow conversation with them.]
 44:  802| [45] [After the PRC field trip, Salyu had Dr. Tenkawa pick her up.]
 45:  813| [45] [She waited by the side of the building for a while and eventually, the professor's car approached and stopped.]
 46:  845| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  848| [45] ["Good work today, Yui."]
 48:  853| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  856| [45] ["Ah, Professor."]
 50:  882| [47] [Miyoko]
 51:  885| [45] ["How was your first day at school?"]
 52:  890| [47] [Salyu]
 53:  893| [45] ["Mmm, I'm tired... but I did establish contact with Natsuhiko and Mashiro."]
 54:  901| [47] [Miyoko]
 55:  904| [45] ["Good. Just as planned. Were you able to get along with them?"]
 56:  909| [47] [Salyu]
 57:  912| [45] ["Quite. We're already friends now."]
 58:  935| [47] [Miyoko]
 59:  936| [45] ["..."]
 60:  941| [47] [Alice]
 61:  944| [45] ["Kyuu~n..."]
 62:  949| [45] [Suddenly, ARMS cried anxiously.]
 63:  954| [47] [Salyu]
 64:  957| [45] ["Professor, you're feeling anxious? Why?"]
 65:  983| [47] [Miyoko]
 66:  986| [45] ["N-no, it's just your imagination..."]
 67:  991| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  994| [45] ["?"]
 69:  999| [45] [Perhaps even ARMS was capable of making a misjudgment.]
 70: 1004| [45] [The professor didn't seem to have anything to be anxious about, in any case.]
 71: 1030| [47] [Miyoko]
 72: 1033| [45] ["Anyway, starting from today, you'll be living at my house. Let's head over there."]
 73: 1041| [47] [Miyoko]
 74: 1044| [45] ["I'm fairly sure that not even that boy will object..."]
 75: 1049| [47] [Salyu]
 76: 1052| [45] ["Understood."]
 77: 1123| [45] [But once they had gone to the Tenkawa residence and reunited with Natsuhiko and Mashiro--]
 78: 1211| [45] [Natsuhiko objected to Salyu moving in.]
 79: 1216| [47] [Salyu]
 80: 1217| [45] [(That's strange... Nobody told me to expect this development.)]
 81: 1222| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1223| [45] [(But I thought we were already friends. I haven't even touched on the phantom subject.)]
 83: 1228| [45] [But the professor quickly departed, leaving the confused Salyu to her own devices.]
 84: 1251| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1254| [45] ["Is it a bother for me to live in this house?"]
 86: 1259| [47] [Salyu]
 87: 1262| [45] ["This isn't what the professor said would happen. She said you guys wouldn't object."]
 88: 1288| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1291| [45] ["...!"]
 90: 1296| [45] [Salyu twitched in fear when she saw that expression on Natsuhiko's face.]
 91: 1301| [47] [Salyu]
 92: 1302| [45] [(Even someone like me can understand that expression...)]
 93: 1307| [45] [Natsuhiko was mad. And Salyu had a feeling she knew to whom that anger was directed.]
 94: 1312| [47] [Salyu]
 95: 1313| [45] [(It can't be... Am I... a nuisance...?)]
 96: 1318| [45] [The thought saddened her.]
 97: 1323| [45] [The happiness she had finally gained had suddenly withered.]
 98: 1402| [45] [In a desperate effort to open her heart to Natsuhiko even just a little, she even tried talking to him about her role, but--]
 99: 1407| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1410| [45] ["I was sent here to protect you, after all."]
101: 1436| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1439| [45] ["Huh...? You... protect me?"]
103: 1444| [45] [Natsuhiko only stared blankly. He didn't seem happy at all.]
104: 1449| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1450| [45] [(He really isn't accepting me...)]
106: 1455| [47] [Salyu]
107: 1456| [45] [(Why does he have to be so cruel to me? I've done nothing wrong...)]
108: 1461| [45] [Salyu couldn't understand a thing that was on Natsuhiko's mind.]
109: 1533| [45] [--And thus, the first day of Salyu's new life came to an anxious end.]
110: 1538| [45] [She was wondering if things could get worse from there, but--]
111: 1642| [45] [Starting the next day, things took a turn for the better.]
112: 1647| [45] [She went shopping with Natsuhiko and Mashiro and opened her heart to them a little bit...]
113: 1652| [45] [And after Natsuhiko asked her about how they had met at the scene of the accident two days prior, Salyu gathered the courage to tell him about her weakness.]
114: 1657| [47] [Salyu]
115: 1660| [45] ["... To be honest, I'm very poor at understanding the nuances of people's emotions and facial expressions."]
116: 1665| [47] [Salyu]
117: 1668| [45] ["It's thanks to this thing that I can finally communicate properly with people."]
118: 1784| [45] [And with that, she showed ARMS to Natsuhiko.]
119: 1826| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1829| [45] ["That's why I was uneasy about adapting to a new life. But with ARMS, I think I can somehow manage."]
121: 1855| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1858| [45] ["... So that's how it was."]
123: 1863| [45] [Natsuhiko fell silent at Salyu's words for a few moments before timidly speaking up.]
124: 1889| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1892| [45] ["Say, Salyu..."]
126: 1897| [47] [Salyu]
127: 1900| [45] ["What is it?"]
128: 1926| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1929| [45] ["Umm, well... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for always acting so hostile towards you."]
130: 1934| [47] [Salyu]
131: 1937| [45] ["... Mm."]
132: 1942| [45] [It was still an awkwardly stilted conversation-- but it didn't feel unpleasant at all.]
133: 1986| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1987| [45] [(I've learned something... The key to good communication might be honesty.)]
135: 1992| [47] [Salyu]
136: 1993| [45] [(You should open up your heart and come in contact with others, even if they seem scary.)]
137: 1998| [45] [That was an epiphany to Salyu.]
138: 2071| [45] [And that night, Mashiro threw a welcome party for Salyu.]
139: 2076| [47] [Mashiro]
140: 2079| [45] ["Okay, thanks for waiting!"]
141: 2084| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2087| [45] ["W-whoaaah~!!"]
143: 2161| [47] [Salyu]
144: 2164| [45] ["... Magnificent."]
145: 2169| [45] [The food was very delicious, but above all else, it was Mashiro's consideration that delighted Salyu.]
146: 2174| [47] [Salyu]
147: 2175| [45] [(She's gentle and she doesn't hide behind a mask... Her speech and conduct match almost perfectly with Alice's judgment.)]
148: 2180| [47] [Salyu]
149: 2181| [45] [(Everything she says seems to be genuine.)]
150: 2186| [45] [Even though Salyu couldn't understand the minds of others, she felt like she could believe Mashiro unconditionally.]
151: 2282| [45] [Afterwards, they all talked about novels and had a fun time.]
152: 2367| [45] [Once Mashiro went home, Salyu tried asking Natsuhiko a question.]
153: 2372| [47] [Salyu]
154: 2375| [45] ["--It looked to me like everyone had fun today. Did you have fun, Natsuhiko?"]
155: 2401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2404| [45] ["Huh? W-well, of course. Did you have a bad time, Salyu?"]
157: 2409| [47] [Salyu]
158: 2412| [45] ["... No."]
159: 2417| [47] [Salyu]
160: 2420| [45] ["I had a lot of fun too."]
161: 2443| [45] [When Salyu said that with a smile, Natsuhiko smiled back.]
162: 2448| [45] [If only days like this could continue forever... That's what Salyu wished.]
163: 2526| [45] [--But that peace did not last long.]
164: 2531| [45] [The next night, Natsuhiko and Mashiro got into a fight, even though Salyu had thought they were getting along.]
165: 2613| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 2616| [45] ["I can't count on you for anything anymore, Natsuhiko! Goodbye!"]
167: 2625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2628| [45] ["H-hey, wait a second, Mashiro!"]
169: 2633| [45] [And the next day--]
170: 2727| [45] [Salyu herself got into a fight with Natsuhiko.]
171: 2732| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2735| [45] ["If you don't believe Mashiro, then why don't you just leave her alone?"]
173: 2743| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2746| [45] ["Hey... don't you think you're being a little too cold?"]
175: 2772| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2775| [45] ["You're not gonna make any friends like that."]
177: 2795| [47] [Salyu]
178: 2798| [45] ["..."]
179: 2803| [45] [Those words gouged out Salyu's heart.]
180: 2808| [45] [She had never expected one of her first ever friends to say that to her.]
181: 2813| [47] [Salyu]
182: 2814| [45] [(Ah, but... if I talk to him honestly, then maybe...)]
183: 2819| [45] [Once she got that idea, Salyu talked once more about her peculiar trait.]
184: 2824| [45] [About the dysfunctional part of her brain.]
185: 2829| [45] [And how as a result, she couldn't understand other people's feelings in the slightest--]
186: 2852| [47] [Salyu]
187: 2855| [45] ["I came to Japan, met all of you, and had fun, but... at times, I've also been confused, and also scared."]
188: 2860| [47] [Salyu]
189: 2863| [45] ["Perhaps I really wasn't meant to interact with other people."]
190: 2868| [45] [Salyu spoke on the verge of tears-- but Natsuhiko replied in a subdued voice.]
191: 2894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2897| [45] ["... Don't tell yourself you weren't meant to interact with other people."]
193: 2905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2908| [45] ["It's true that we can't understand other people's feelings."]
195: 2916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2919| [45] ["When I say we can't understand other people's feelings, I don't just mean you and me, Salyu. Nobody truly can."]
197: 2924| [47] [Salyu]
198: 2927| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
199: 2932| [47] [Salyu]
200: 2935| [45] ["It's not just me... but everyone?"]
201: 2961| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2964| [45] ["That's right. But don't you think... we should still try our best to understand each other regardless?"]
203: 2972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 2975| [45] ["... You don't need a full understanding of what's on other people's minds. But as long as you keep striving for it... In other words, as long as you keep other people in consideration..."]
205: 2983| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 2986| [45] ["Then I'm sure things will turn out for the best. Both for you and for those you interact with..."]
207: 2994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2997| [45] ["And unless you afford that kindness to others, nobody will be kind to you, will they?"]
209: 3002| [45] [--Those words reverberated in Salyu's mind.]
210: 3007| [47] [Salyu]
211: 3008| [45] [(I see. If everyone's the same way... then I'm just wasting my time worrying about it alone.)]
212: 3013| [47] [Salyu]
213: 3014| [45] [(Perhaps Natsuhiko has the same sort of worries I do inside.)]
214: 3019| [47] [Salyu]
215: 3020| [45] [(He overcame those worries to say all that...)]
216: 3025| [47] [Salyu]
217: 3026| [45] [(... Is this what it means to sympathize with someone??)]
218: 3031| [45] [At that time, Salyu felt like she gained at least a slight understanding of Natsuhiko's incomprehensible boyish mind.]
219: 3036| [47] [Salyu]
220: 3037| [45] [(Then I need to respond... by trying to sympathize with Natsuhiko too.)]
221: 3084| [45] [Salyu reconciled with Natsuhiko and the two of them decided to search for Mashiro together.]
222: 3117| [47] [Salyu]
223: 3120| [45] ["--Let's calm down and think about a way to find her. I'll help."]
224: 3146| [47] [Natsuhiko]
225: 3149| [45] ["Yeah!"]
226: 3217| [45] [They regrouped with Mashiro in front of the melancholic city gate--]
227: 3274| [45] [They searched for terrorists and trespassed into the PRC.]
228: 3334| [45] [And as a result of a misunderstanding there, they became a target for the security department,]
229: 3391| [45] [and thus they spent the night at a karaoke box.]
230: 3434| [45] [Salyu's life began to take a huge change.]
231: 3439| [45] [She couldn't recommend Natsuhiko and Mashiro stepping into danger, but in the corner of her mind, she enjoyed it.]
232: 3444| [47] [Salyu]
233: 3445| [45] [(... It's kind of like an adventure...)]
234: 3450| [47] [Salyu]
235: 3451| [45] [(It might possibly contradict my role, but I think I might like this sort of thing.)]
236: 3509| [45] [--The adventure continued to the next day.]
237: 3557| [45] [After they encountered the PRC explosion, they realized that the enemy's real target was LABO's nuclear reactor--]
238: 3614| [45] [And they confronted the terrorists at the ruined factory.]
239: 3664| [45] [They suffered a temporary defeat, but once they woke up from being knocked out, the three kids talked.]
240: 3669| [45] [Natsuhiko decided to head to LABO to prevent the terrorist plot.]
241: 3674| [45] [And so Salyu and Mashiro chose to cooperate with him as well.]
242: 3770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 3773| [45] ["Aagh, geez... How can you two be so stubborn...!?"]
244: 3781| [47] [Mashiro]
245: 3784| [45] ["I don't want to hear it from you, Natsuhiko. The three of us just have the same idea in mind."]
246: 3789| [47] [Salyu]
247: 3792| [45] ["Total agreement."]
248: 3830| [45] [And then the kids smiled at each other.]
249: 3835| [45] [They eventually sorted out their story.]
250: 3861| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 3864| [45] ["... Okay, then. Ready, guys?"]
252: 3869| [47] [Salyu]
253: 3872| [45] ["Roger."]
254: 3898| [47] [Mashiro]
255: 3901| [45] ["Mmm, I'm ready to go when you are."]
256: 3927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3930| [45] ["Let's go, to protect the city...!"]
258: 3935| [45] [Salyu nodded and broke off into a dash.]
259: 3940| [45] [Alongside the two precious friends that fate had brought to her in that city.]
