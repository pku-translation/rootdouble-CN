  0:   76| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
  1:   84| [45] [Just then, Ena, who'd kept quiet the whole time, cut into the conversation.]
  2:  164| [47] [Ena]
  3:  167| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, why aren't you saying anything?"]
  4:  175| [47] [Ena]
  5:  178| [45] ["Are you just going to let what they said pass as fact?"]
  6:  186| [47] [Watase]
  7:  189| [45] ["Teach... you don't trust me either?"]
  8:  194| [45] [Then that meant that Watase had lost the trust of the whole team.]
  9:  220| [47] [Ena]
 10:  223| [45] ["That's..."]
 11:  249| [47] [Ena]
 12:  252| [45] ["... But if things keep going this way, I can't trust you."]
 13:  260| [47] [Ena]
 14:  263| [45] ["You'll need to show some proof if you want to be trusted."]
 15:  271| [47] [Ena]
 16:  274| [45] ["You need to tell everyone what you were doing in that 'six minute blank'."]
 17:  279| [45] [The six minute blank--]
 18:  284| [45] [That was indeed the main reason why no one trusted him right now.]
 19:  292| [47] [Watase]
 20:  295| [45] ["B-but..."]
 21:  300| [45] [He couldn't recall the events of those six minutes no matter how hard he tried.]
 22:  305| [45] [Ena then spoke to Watase in a compelling voice.]
 23:  331| [47] [Ena]
 24:  334| [45] ["Please, Captain Kasasagi... I want to trust you. But I can't do that now."]
 25:  342| [47] [Ena]
 26:  345| [45] ["I need a reason to help you out."]
 27:  353| [47] [Watase]
 28:  356| [45] ["T-Teach..."]
 29:  361| [47] [Watase]
 30:  362| [45] [(Could she be giving me a chance?)]
 31:  367| [45] [Watase desperately tried to think of something that would support Ena's argument.]
 32:  372| [45] [--But he had nothing.]
 33:  377| [45] [He couldn't find anything that would satisfy his comrades' doubts.]
 34:  444| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  447| [45] ["I think we've waited long enough, Ms. Tsubakiyama."]
 36:  455| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  458| [45] ["We've already offered enough evidence to cast suspicion on Captain Kasasagi.%NAny more discussion would be fruitless."]
 38:  500| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  503| [45] ["Right? Don't you agree, Ms. Moribe?"]
 40:  529| [47] [Jun]
 41:  532| [45] ["Yeah... I can't trust the Captain anymore either..."]
 42:  558| [47] [Ena]
 43:  561| [45] ["Hold on, guys! Let's hear him out for a little while--"]
 44:  587| [47] [Ukita]
 45:  590| [45] ["No, he's had enough time to make his excuses."]
 46:  616| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  619| [45] ["Or do you have some concrete reason to want to cover for him?"]
 48:  645| [47] [Ena]
 49:  648| [45] ["W-well..."]
 50:  674| [47] [Jun]
 51:  677| [45] ["You don't, right? Then just shut up already."]
 52:  685| [47] [Jun]
 53:  688| [45] ["If you don't-- then things could get ugly again, like when we found that gun you were hiding."]
 54:  714| [47] [Ena]
 55:  717| [45] ["..."]
 56:  722| [45] [Jun and Ukita's harsh glares shut Ena right up.]
 57:  727| [45] [Ukita then turned his gaze to Watase and spoke.]
 58:  797| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  800| [45] ["Now then... what to do with you?"]
 60:  808| [47] [Jun]
 61:  811| [45] ["Why don't we tie him up and lock him away somewhere?"]
 62:  819| [47] [Ukita]
 63:  822| [45] ["Sounds good. Now that that's decided, let's find something to bind him--"]
 64:  830| [47] [Jun]
 65:  833| [45] ["Oh, how about this cable? Will it work?"]
 66:  841| [47] [Ukita]
 67:  844| [45] ["Yes. I'm sure pulling out one mere cable won't do any harm to the system."]
 68:  849| [45] [The two of them smirked at each other maliciously as they pulled a cable out from under the control panel.]
 69:  854| [45] [It was then that Watase finally realized it:]
 70:  938| [45] [Their eyes were full of madness.]
 71: 1002| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1003| [45] [(Th-this is bad... these guys aren't in their right minds...!)]
 73: 1008| [45] [Watase glanced briefly at the door as he shuddered in fear.]
 74: 1013| [45] [--Just then.]
 75: 1069| [47] [Jun]
 76: 1072| [45] ["Ah! Trying to run!?"]
 77: 1080| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1083| [45] ["Not good! Hold him down!"]
 79: 1188| [45] [The two of them suddenly sprung at Watase.]
 80: 1198| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1201| [45] ["--!"]
 82: 1217| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1220| [45] ["L-let me go!"]
 84: 1227| [45] [Watase succumbed to panic and shook them off of him.]
 85: 1232| [45] [It was right then that his elbow smashed into Jun's face.]
 86: 1308| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1311| [45] ["Ahh!"]
 88: 1316| [45] [Jun screamed, and then--]
 89: 1367| [45] [Watase heard a very thick sound behind him.]
 90: 1422| [45] [He turned around to see Jun's head crashing into the edge of a piece of machinery.]
 91: 1430| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1433| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 93: 1438| [45] [Jun moaned in agony-- then suddenly stopped moving right then and there, her eyes still agape.]
 94: 1503| [47] [Kazami]
 95: 1506| [45] ["M-Moribe!?"]
 96: 1511| [45] [Kazami spoke in what almost sounded like a scream and held Jun's body in her arms.]
 97: 1519| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1522| [45] ["Moribe! Hang in there! Moribe!"]
 99: 1527| [45] [But Jun didn't answer.]
100: 1553| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1556| [45] ["I-it can't be..."]
102: 1561| [45] [Kazami lost her composure and checked Jun's Vital Checker.]
103: 1658| [45] [--All red. Vital signs flat.]
104: 1663| [45] [Watase saw that with his own eyes.]
105: 1687| [47] [Watase]
106: 1690| [45] ["A-are you kidding me...?"]
107: 1695| [45] [Humans shouldn't be able to die so easily.]
108: 1700| [45] [That thought flickered through Watase's head.]
109: 1705| [45] [But the fact remained that Jun was neither moving nor breathing.]
110: 1735| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1738| [45] ["Aaah, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
112: 1746| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1749| [45] ["Jun! Please answer me! Jun! Jun!"]
114: 1775| [47] [Kazami]
115: 1778| [45] ["Why... why did this...!?"]
116: 1822| [45] [Kazami's shouts of grief echoed through the room.]
117: 1884| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1887| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... you've really done it this time...!"]
119: 1892| [45] [A dark flame smoldered in Ukita's eyes.]
120: 1900| [47] [Watase]
121: 1903| [45] ["N-no... no, I didn't...!"]
122: 1962| [45] [Watase panicked. Before he knew it, he was bolting for the door.]
123: 1992| [45] [Ena stood in his way.]
124: 1997| [45] [Watase immediately shouted at her.]
125: 2005| [47] [Watase]
126: 2008| [45] ["Teach! Please get out of my way!"]
127: 2016| [47] [Ena]
128: 2019| [45] ["No... I can't do that..."]
129: 2045| [47] [Ena]
130: 2048| [45] ["I hate to say it... but you have committed a grave sin..."]
131: 2056| [47] [Ena]
132: 2059| [45] ["Now you must live up to it as an adult. As a man."]
133: 2085| [47] [Ena]
134: 2088| [45] ["So please-- don't run away from the reality behind you! I'm begging you!"]
135: 2093| [45] [Ena looked Watase straight in the eye, compelling him to listen to her.]
136: 2098| [45] [There were no signs of madness in her eyes.]
137: 2106| [47] [Watase]
138: 2109| [45] ["Teach..."]
139: 2114| [45] [Watase had indeed committed a sin.]
140: 2119| [45] [Accident or not, he had still taken the life of one of his comrades with his very hands.]
141: 2124| [45] [That was something completely unforgivable.]
142: 2129| [47] [Watase]
143: 2130| [45] [(I... dammit...)]
144: 2135| [45] [Watase stopped trying to run away, his strength slowly leaving him.]
145: 2140| [45] [He then looked at Ena and spoke.]
146: 2148| [47] [Watase]
147: 2151| [45] ["I'm sorry... I'll do as you say."]
148: 2156| [45] [Watase feebly gave that answer-- but then...]
149: 2185| [47] [Watase]
150: 2188| [45] ["!!"]
151: 2193| [45] [Someone suddenly rammed right into his back with all their might.]
152: 2198| [45] [Watase was sent flying to the ground--]
153: 2239| [47] [Ena]
154: 2242| [45] ["Ahh!"]
155: 2247| [45] [--and knocked into Ena, who fell with him.]
156: 2301| [45] [When he came to his senses, someone was bending over his back.]
157: 2306| [47] [Watase]
158: 2307| [45] [(--Who is it!?)]
159: 2312| [45] [Was it Ukita? Or Kazami?]
160: 2317| [45] [But as Watase tried to turn around--]
161: 2325| [47] [Watase]
162: 2328| [45] ["--!?"]
163: 2333| [45] [His whole body went numb with a shock.]
164: 2338| [45] [Something had been slid between his ribs through his back.]
165: 2343| [45] [--Something cold?]
166: 2348| [45] [That thought crossed Watase's mind for a minute,]
167: 2353| [47] [Watase]
168: 2354| [45] [(It burns!)]
169: 2359| [45] [but he was mistaken. His brain had merely perceived it incorrectly.]
170: 2364| [45] [A second later, he realized what had happened.]
171: 2369| [47] [Watase]
172: 2370| [45] [(I've-- been stabbed!?)]
173: 2375| [45] [By who? With what? Why?]
174: 2380| [45] [Those questions flashed through his head all at once.]
175: 2450| [47] [???]
176: 2453| [45] ["Haah... haah... haah..."]
177: 2458| [45] [He heard someone panting heavily.]
178: 2466| [47] [Ena]
179: 2469| [45] ["Wha... why would you--!?"]
180: 2474| [47] [Watase]
181: 2475| [45] [(--Who is it!?)]
182: 2480| [47] [Watase]
183: 2481| [45] [(Who stabbed me!?)]
184: 2486| [45] [But before he could figure it out--]
185: 2618| [47] [Watase]
186: 2621| [45] ["Gagh-- gaaaaagh!"]
187: 2626| [45] [Watase threw blood up on Ena's chest.]
188: 2631| [45] [And it didn't stop there--]
189: 2639| [47] [Watase]
190: 2642| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
191: 2647| [45] [A great rush of blood came flooding out of his mouth with each violent coughing fit.]
192: 2652| [45] [His lungs were already full of blood.]
193: 2657| [45] [He couldn't breathe.]
194: 2662| [45] [It hurt. So much so that he couldn't take it.]
195: 2670| [47] [Watase]
196: 2673| [45] ["*cough* *cough*! *cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*!"]
197: 2678| [45] [His vision was dyed dark red with blood.]
198: 2683| [45] [And then--]
199: 2731| [45] [Light suddenly dissipated from his field of vision.]
200: 2736| [45] [Sound also faded away from his world.]
201: 2741| [45] [Despite that, his suffering did not end.]
202: 2746| [45] [He was drowning in the blood filling his lungs.]
203: 2751| [45] [It hurts.]
204: 2756| [45] [It hurts.]
205: 2761| [45] [It hurts.]
206: 2766| [45] [He screamed.]
207: 2774| [47] [Watase]
208: 2777| [45] [" "]
209: 2782| [45] [My voice isn't coming out!]
210: 2787| [45] [It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.]
211: 2792| [47] [Watase]
212: 2793| [45] [(Is this my punishment for taking Jun's life!?)]
213: 2798| [47] [Watase]
214: 2799| [45] [(Then please-- let it end quickly!)]
215: 2804| [45] [Watase's consciousness was then devoured wholly by his agony.]
216: 2892| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]

218: 2898| [85] [　]

220: 2904| [85] [　]
221: 2907| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by either raising favor towards Ena leading up to this point]
