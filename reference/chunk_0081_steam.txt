  1:   17| [45] [------]
  2:   22| [45] [----]
  3:   27| [45] [--Over ten seconds had passed since the beeping had stopped.]
  4:   32| [45] [But the only sound that filled the block was Watase and Ena's panting.]
  5:   85| [47] [Watase]
  6:   88| [45] ["...?"]
  7:  115| [45] [The two of them got off the floor and timidly took a peek into the stairwell.]
  8:  120| [45] [However-- no explosion had happened.]
  9:  146| [45] [Watase timidly got up and looked into the stairwell behind him.]
 10:  151| [45] [However-- no explosion had happened.]
 11:  176| [45] [Ena also got up, her eyebrows furrowed.]
 12:  209| [47] [Ena]
 13:  212| [45] ["It didn't explode...? Why?"]
 14:  220| [47] [Watase]
 15:  223| [45] ["I don't know... but it looks like we're still ticking."]
 16:  231| [47] [Watase]
 17:  234| [45] ["Was it a dud...?"]
 18:  260| [47] [Ena]
 19:  263| [45] ["Maybe... but... something's weird here."]
 20:  271| [47] [Ena]
 21:  274| [45] ["Something about this feels different compared to everything else that's happened so far."]
 22:  282| [47] [Watase]
 23:  285| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 24:  332| [45] [True, there had been several "bizarre factors" so far.]
 25:  337| [45] [Like the sprinkler system being offline, or the passageway blocked by the electric cable and puddle, or the cargo lift being broken.]
 26:  342| [45] [But unlike all of those, there had been a clear "malice" behind this incident.]
 27:  347| [47] [Watase]
 28:  348| [45] [(But that was a bit of a sloppy job, wasn't it...?)]
 29:  353| [45] [Watase looked at the kicked down fire door.]
 30:  358| [45] [There was something that appeared to be a metal bar lying next to it. That must have been what'd been holding back the door.]
 31:  363| [47] [Watase]
 32:  364| [45] [(It felt very "improvised on the spot" for a trap...)]
 33:  369| [45] [And on top of that, the bomb in question hadn't detonated.]
 34:  374| [45] [If the one who'd set the whole thing up had been trying to kill Watase and Ena, then they'd failed completely.]
 35:  379| [47] [Watase]
 36:  380| [45] [(Was there some reason they didn't spend much time on prepping it?)]
 37:  397| [45] [Watase's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching.]
 38:  405| [47] [Watase]
 39:  408| [45] ["Who's there!?"]
 40:  492| [45] [He turned around to find Jun running towards him.]
 41:  519| [47] [Jun]
 42:  522| [45] ["Ah, Captain, Ms. Tsubakiyama!"]
 43:  530| [47] [Watase]
 44:  533| [45] ["Oh, it's just you..."]
 45:  601| [47] [Jun]
 46:  604| [45] ["Hey, what's with the cold reception!? I hauled my injured ass over here on the double as soon as I heard that loud 'bang' or whatever, and this is what I get?"]
 47:  615| [45] [Another set of footsteps closed in as Jun said that.]
 48:  700| [47] [Jun]
 49:  703| [45] ["Hey, what's with the cold reception!? I hauled my ass over here on the double as soon as I heard that loud 'bang' or whatever, and this is what I get?"]
 50:  729| [47] [Ena]
 51:  732| [45] ["What happened to Ms. Tachibana? Why isn't she with you?"]
 52:  737| [45] [Jun's face clouded over when Ena asked that.]
 53:  763| [47] [Jun]
 54:  766| [45] ["The Lieutenant's... leg got hurt in an explosion while we were searching Area 3...!"]
 55:  774| [47] [Watase]
 56:  777| [45] ["An explosion!? Anyway, is Tachibana okay!?"]
 57:  803| [47] [Jun]
 58:  806| [45] ["She's resting in the surveillance room while keeping an eye on the cameras..."]
 59:  814| [47] [Jun]
 60:  817| [45] ["But I think she'll be up and about soon."]
 61:  825| [47] [Watase]
 62:  828| [45] ["I see..."]
 63:  833| [45] [Watase breathed a sigh of relief, but also felt anxiety welling up in him at the same time.]
 64:  838| [45] [--Kazami had been injured just as Watase and Ena had almost fallen victim to a trap.%NIt stunk too much to be a coincidence.]
 65:  843| [47] [Watase]
 66:  844| [45] [(It feels like there's an "invisible enemy" that's attacking us...!)]
 67:  849| [45] [Though he was seized by that fear, Watase and Jun synchronized their PDAs' map data to share their search results.]
 68:  861| [45] [Once they finished, they heard yet another pair of footsteps.]
 69:  866| [45] [They looked up to see Ukita running their way.]
 70:  916| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  919| [45] ["Oh, you're all here!"]
 72:  946| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  949| [45] ["I heard a most peculiar sound! What happened!?"]
 74:  954| [45] [Jun and Ukita had both said more or less the exact same thing.]
 75:  960| [47] [Watase]
 76:  961| [45] [(Come to think of it--)]
 77: 1005| [45] [Watase looked at Ena's hands in surprise.]
 78: 1050| [45] [Ukita and Jun did the same, then gasped.]
 79: 1058| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1061| [45] ["M-Ms. Tsubakiyama...!"]
 81: 1069| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1072| [45] ["Wh-what are... what are you doing with a pistol!?"]
 83: 1107| [47] [Ena]
 84: 1110| [45] ["Oh, this is... uh..."]
 85: 1115| [45] [Ena's body froze, then she took a step back.]
 86: 1123| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1126| [45] ["Teach... you took that gun out of your clothes, right...?"]
 88: 1152| [47] [Ukita]
 89: 1155| [45] ["What!? What's the meaning of this!? Why do you have something like that with you!?"]
 90: 1181| [47] [Jun]
 91: 1184| [45] ["Yeah! I thought you were a teacher!"]
 92: 1210| [47] [Ena]
 93: 1213| [45] ["Hold on a minute, you're all making a big misunderstanding!"]
 94: 1239| [47] [Ena]
 95: 1242| [45] ["This pistol isn't mine! I found it here in LABO!"]
 96: 1250| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1253| [45] ["Found it? Where?"]
 98: 1279| [47] [Ena]
 99: 1282| [45] ["... In the room with the cargo lift."]
100: 1308| [47] [Ena]
101: 1311| [45] ["It was lying in a corner there."]
102: 1383| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1386| [45] ["Really...?"]
104: 1412| [47] [Jun]
105: 1415| [45] ["You really saying you found and took that pistol while we were performing CPR?"]
106: 1441| [47] [Ena]
107: 1444| [45] ["B-but... it's the truth..."]
108: 1449| [45] [Ena cringed at Ukita and Jun's harsh glares.]
109: 1454| [45] [Watase thought over the whole situation--]
110: 1472| [47] [Watase]
111: 1475| [45] ["W-well, whatever. Let's trust her."]
112: 1501| [47] [Jun]
113: 1504| [45] ["Wait, you're believing her just like that?"]
114: 1514| [45] [And realized it was indeed strange.]
115: 1519| [45] [Ena had taken out that gun and fired without any hesitation in an emergency situation.]
116: 1524| [45] [And all four of her shots pinpointed the door's hinges with destructive accuracy.%NIf she'd never held a gun before, that was some nigh-impossible beginner's luck she had.]
117: 1532| [47] [Watase]
118: 1535| [45] ["Teach... have you ever fired a gun before?"]
119: 1561| [47] [Ena]
120: 1564| [45] ["Hell no!"]
121: 1590| [47] [Ena]
122: 1593| [45] ["But, well... you might laugh at me when you hear this...."]
123: 1619| [47] [Ena]
124: 1622| [45] ["But I'm a big airsoft aficionado."]
125: 1648| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1651| [45] ["Airsoft?"]
127: 1677| [47] [Ena]
128: 1680| [45] ["Yes, also known as survival games... it's a grown-up version of playing soldier where you shoot each other with air guns."]
129: 1688| [47] [Ena]
130: 1691| [45] ["So while I've never handled a real gun before, I got good at shooting from that... well, as good as you -can- get, I suppose."]
131: 1717| [47] [Jun]
132: 1720| [45] ["Wow, never took you for such a kid. But isn't there a complete world of difference between holding an air gun and the real McCoy?"]
133: 1746| [47] [Ena]
134: 1749| [45] ["I know that. I was just answering Captain Kasasagi's question, that's all."]
135: 1757| [47] [Watase]
136: 1760| [45] ["Sorry for asking so--"]
137: 1765| [45] [But Ukita interrupted before Watase was done.]
138: 1773| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1776| [45] ["Then you're still sticking to your story that you found that gun and took it with you?"]
140: 1802| [47] [Ena]
141: 1805| [45] ["Yes, though I admit I can't prove it..."]
142: 1813| [47] [Watase]
143: 1816| [45] ["I see... but let's just trust her for now."]
144: 1842| [47] [Jun]
145: 1845| [45] ["Wait, you believe her?"]
146: 1853| [47] [Watase]
147: 1856| [45] ["Well, we can't prove otherwise, so yeah, nothing we can do about that."]
148: 1861| [45] [Watase admonished Jun, then turned back to Ena.]
149: 1869| [47] [Watase]
150: 1872| [45] ["... But why did you keep that thing hidden up until now, Teach?%N-That's- the real problem here."]
151: 1898| [47] [Ena]
152: 1901| [45] ["... I didn't feel like I had a choice back then..."]
153: 1927| [47] [Ena]
154: 1930| [45] ["We'd just seen a body and found out that the escape route was a no-go..."]
155: 1938| [47] [Ena]
156: 1941| [45] ["So I felt that I had to protect myself no matter what it took..."]
157: 1949| [47] [Watase]
158: 1952| [45] ["..."]
159: 1957| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, Ena had mentioned the "killer" several times right after that incident.]
160: 1962| [45] [She'd kept on insisting that the killer was still in the facility.]
161: 1967| [47] [Watase]
162: 1968| [45] [(Was that because she'd just found that gun... and because she was preparing to protect herself?)]
163: 1973| [45] [Ena continued as Watase pondered that.]
164: 1999| [47] [Ena]
165: 2002| [45] ["Then after that, it just never felt like the right time to bring it up... I'm sorry."]
166: 2010| [47] [Ena]
167: 2013| [45] ["Um... could you all please trust me...?"]
168: 2018| [45] [Ena said that in a feeble voice.]
169: 2056| [45] [Ukita and Jun replied with their voices laced in bitterness.]
170: 2064| [47] [Jun]
171: 2067| [45] ["... Well, let's put aside whether I trust you or not. The fact is that there's a gun here, right?"]
172: 2075| [47] [Ukita]
173: 2078| [45] ["Indeed. Now that we know that, there is absolutely no way we can let you keep that pistol all to yourself."]
174: 2104| [47] [Jun]
175: 2107| [45] ["Then how about I hold on to it for now?"]
176: 2133| [47] [Ukita]
177: 2136| [45] ["What? I'm the oldest one here, so it's only logical that I should keep it, yes?"]
178: 2162| [47] [Ena]
179: 2165| [45] ["A-are you two out of your minds!? It's strange for me to have the gun, yes, but it's also too dangerous for either of you to have it!"]
180: 2191| [47] [Ukita]
181: 2194| [45] ["What...!?"]
182: 2199| [45] [Jun, Ukita, and Ena were all glaring at each other fiercely.]
183: 2250| [45] [Watase felt a shiver run down his spine when he saw that.]
184: 2255| [47] [Watase]
185: 2256| [45] [(Wh-what're they saying...!? Are they planning to start fighting each other for the gun!?)]
186: 2261| [45] [It was likely that a fight really would break out if he didn't act soon.]
187: 2266| [45] [Watase frantically rose his voice.]
188: 2288| [47] [Watase]
189: 2291| [45] ["Then you hold on to the gun, Moribe!"]
190: 2317| [47] [Ena]
191: 2320| [45] ["Huh!? Why Ms. Moribe!?"]
192: 2328| [47] [Watase]
193: 2331| [45] ["You and the old man are civilians, right? So leaving it up to a professional like Moribe is the right choice."]
194: 2357| [47] [Ena]
195: 2360| [45] ["A 'professional'...? Now look here, you may be professional rescue workers, but that does not make you professionals at handling a gun!"]
196: 2386| [47] [Ukita]
197: 2389| [45] ["Argh, enough grumbling-- just give me that gun already!"]
198: 2394| [45] [--And thus, a quarrel broke out.]
199: 2399| [45] [The four of them were soon shouting whatever they liked back and forth at each other...]
200: 2410| [45] [After having wasted more than enough time, Watase finally interrupted them.]
201: 2464| [47] [Watase]
202: 2467| [45] ["W-wait a minute, guys... this isn't getting us anywhere."]
203: 2493| [47] [Jun]
204: 2496| [45] ["Then what do you say we should do?"]
205: 2509| [47] [Watase]
206: 2512| [45] ["Then letting Teach keep holding on to it really is the best choice. She seems to know her way around a gun, after all."]
207: 2538| [47] [Jun]
208: 2541| [45] ["What!? Are you that stupid!? That's -exactly- why we can't trust her!"]
209: 2567| [47] [Ukita]
210: 2570| [45] ["Argh, enough whining... just give me that gun already!"]
211: 2575| [45] [--And thus, a quarrel broke out.]
212: 2580| [45] [The four of them were soon shouting whatever they liked back and forth at each other...]
213: 2591| [45] [After having wasted more than enough time, Watase finally interrupted them.]
214: 2645| [47] [Watase]
215: 2648| [45] ["W-wait a minute, guys... this isn't getting us anywhere."]
216: 2674| [47] [Jun]
217: 2677| [45] ["Then what do you say we should do?"]
218: 2689| [47] [Watase]
219: 2692| [45] ["Then let's have the old man hold onto the gun! We can trust him on this."]
220: 2718| [47] [Ukita]
221: 2721| [45] ["Yes, that's right, Captain Kasasagi! Letting me have the gun truly is the best option!"]
222: 2747| [47] [Ena]
223: 2750| [45] ["N-no!"]
224: 2776| [47] [Jun]
225: 2779| [45] ["She's right! It'd be much safer in my hands, you can bet on that!"]
226: 2805| [47] [Ukita]
227: 2808| [45] ["What in the world has gotten into you people!? That's enough, just give me that gun already!"]
228: 2813| [45] [--And thus, a quarrel broke out.]
229: 2818| [45] [The four of them were soon shouting whatever they liked back and forth at each other...]
230: 2829| [45] [After having wasted more than enough time, Watase finally interrupted them.]
231: 2883| [47] [Watase]
232: 2886| [45] ["W-wait a minute, guys... this isn't getting us anywhere."]
233: 2912| [47] [Jun]
234: 2915| [45] ["Then what do you say we should do?"]
235: 2926| [47] [Watase]
236: 2929| [45] ["Wait guys! Just wait a sec!"]
237: 2955| [47] [Jun]
238: 2958| [45] ["What!?"]
239: 2984| [47] [Ukita]
240: 2987| [45] ["There is no chance I'm letting you hold on to it. It's simply out of the question."]
241: 2995| [47] [Watase]
242: 2998| [45] ["No, that's not it. I'm saying we should either destroy or throw away that thing.%NIt's too dangerous to keep around."]
243: 3021| [47] [Watase]
244: 3024| [45] ["It's too dangerous to keep this thing around. Let's destroy or throw it away."]
245: 3050| [47] [Jun]
246: 3053| [45] ["But if we destroy it... then none of us will have a way to defend ourselves in the chance that there's a terrorist hiding around down here, right?"]
247: 3079| [47] [Ukita]
248: 3082| [45] ["And throwing it away is not an option either. Someone else will just pick it up eventually."]
249: 3090| [47] [Watase]
250: 3093| [45] ["Mmm... then... umm..."]
251: 3098| [45] [The gears in Watase's mind rotated at high speed-- and then produced him the best answer.]
252: 3145| [47] [Watase]
253: 3148| [45] ["I know, what about this?"]
254: 3195| [47] [Watase]
255: 3198| [45] ["First, we'll take the magazine out of the gun. Then we'll take all the bullets out of that."]
256: 3245| [47] [Watase]
257: 3248| [45] ["Then that'll leave us with three parts: a 'gun without bullets', an 'empty magazine' and 'bullets with nothing to use them with'."]
258: 3256| [47] [Watase]
259: 3259| [45] ["Then we'll give one of each to three of us for safekeeping."]
260: 3286| [47] [Ukita]
261: 3289| [45] ["You're saying we'll split it up?"]
262: 3294| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at Watase's proposal.]
263: 3299| [45] [Watase may have sounded composed on the outside, but he was panicking on the inside.]
264: 3304| [47] [Watase]
265: 3305| [45] [(This gun just had to show up when everyone was already unstable as it was!%NIt's too dangerous to keep around! I've gotta resolve this whole thing peacefully!)]
266: 3310| [45] [Watase kept speaking in the gentlest voice he could in order to hide his fears.]
267: 3318| [47] [Watase]
268: 3321| [45] ["That's right. Then in the extremely rare chance that a terrorist or something does show up--"]
269: 3329| [47] [Watase]
270: 3332| [45] ["We can agree to put the gun back together to defend ourselves, right?"]
271: 3358| [47] [Jun]
272: 3361| [45] ["Hmm... yeah, that's a good point."]
273: 3369| [47] [Watase]
274: 3372| [45] ["And likewise, if a terrorist doesn't show up, then none of us has an advantage over the other. We can all rest easy this way."]
275: 3398| [47] [Ena]
276: 3401| [45] ["But..."]
277: 3409| [47] [Watase]
278: 3412| [45] ["Please go with it. I want to get this stupid issue over with as quickly as possible."]
279: 3417| [45] [Silence reigned over the group for a while.]
280: 3422| [45] [Ena soon let out an exasperated sigh,]
281: 3448| [47] [Ena]
282: 3451| [45] ["... All right. I'll do as you say."]
283: 3456| [45] [then took the magazine out of the gun.]
284: 3461| [45] [She then awkwardly took the bullets out of the magazine and the gun's chamber. There were 11 of them in total.]
285: 3487| [47] [Ena]
286: 3490| [45] ["... Will this do?"]
287: 3498| [47] [Watase]
288: 3501| [45] ["Yeah, it shouldn't be a problem."]
289: 3527| [47] [Ukita]
290: 3530| [45] ["But who'll hold on to what?"]
291: 3538| [47] [Watase]
292: 3541| [45] ["It doesn't really matter, but... how about this? Old man, you'll get the gun, Teach, you'll have the magazine, and Moribe, you hold on to the bullets."]
293: 3567| [47] [Jun]
294: 3570| [45] ["Wait, what about you?"]
295: 3578| [47] [Watase]
296: 3581| [45] ["I'll pass. I'm the one who suggested this, so it's better that I don't take any of it."]
297: 3607| [47] [Ukita]
298: 3610| [45] ["I see... then I suppose we can indeed relax."]
299: 3636| [47] [Jun]
300: 3639| [45] ["I'm cool with that too."]
301: 3647| [47] [Ena]
302: 3650| [45] ["I agree... then let's split it up."]
303: 3655| [45] [Ena then gave Ukita the gun, then the bullets to Jun.]
304: 3663| [47] [Watase]
305: 3666| [45] ["Okay, problem solved now, right?"]
306: 3692| [47] [Jun]
307: 3695| [45] ["Yep, we're A-OK now."]
308: 3721| [47] [Ukita]
309: 3724| [45] ["Indeed, I feel better this way."]
310: 3732| [47] [Ena]
311: 3735| [45] ["Yes..."]
312: 3740| [45] [The three of them seemed placated for the time being.]
313: 3825| [45] [But Watase was thinking about something completely different.]
314: 3877| [47] [Watase]
315: 3878| [45] [(Why did the gun... already have bullets in it when Teach found it?)]
316: 3883| [45] [If the gun had belonged to the "terrorist" Jun mentioned, then why was it lying by the lift?]
317: 3943| [45] [If it'd been empty, then it would've made more sense. That would've meant the terrorist had probably discarded it on purpose.]
318: 3948| [47] [Watase]
319: 3949| [45] [(But who would ever get rid of a loaded gun...?)]
320: 3963| [45] [Then that would mean the owner hadn't "gotten rid" of it, but rather "dropped" it.]
321: 3968| [45] [Or-- maybe they left it there?]
322: 3973| [47] [Watase]
323: 3974| [45] [(... Was it in order to give it to us...?)]
324: 4066| [45] [The gun was now split up into three parts.]
325: 4071| [45] [Watase wondered if this had all been a trap someone set up to drive a rift between the group.]
