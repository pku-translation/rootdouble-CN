  0:   64| [45] [--It was a memory of when Jun was 11 years old.]
  1:   88| [47] [Jun]
  2:   91| [45] ["Screw you, Daddy!"]
  3:   96| [45] [In yet another typical day, Jun yelled those words at her father and ran out of her house.]
  4:  162| [45] [She headed to the nearby park, as always.]
  5:  167| [45] [But her father had never once chased her that far, and this day was no exception.]
  6:  172| [47] [Jun]
  7:  173| [45] [(Why couldn't Daddy be a hero of justice instead...?)]
  8:  178| [45] [She pondered that question as she sat on one of the benches.]
  9:  183| [45] [Jun had always loved anything "hero-related" she'd seen on TV for as long as she could remember.]
 10:  188| [45] [She admired heroes who risked their lives to save others and the Earth.]
 11:  193| [45] [But there was a world of difference between those kinds of heroes and Jun's father.]
 12:  198| [45] [He was a prominent city council member who was even well-known in Rokumei City-- but in a bad way.]
 13:  203| [45] ["Heroes of justice? How ridiculous. There is no absolute justice or evil in this world."]
 14:  208| [45] ["People are not pure good or pure evil either. There are only those who lie in the continuous spectrum of gray between the two."]
 15:  213| [45] [Jun grew sad when she remembered the words her father had said earlier.]
 16:  218| [45] [He was a strict man who never took his daughter into consideration.]
 17:  223| [45] [Jun's mother had fertility issues, so she had faced a lot of hardship until she had become pregnant with Jun.]
 18:  228| [45] [But when Jun was finally born, her father lost interest in both his wife and child on the simple account that a daughter could never be his successor.]
 19:  233| [47] [Jun]
 20:  234| [45] [(... I've been trying real hard to act like a boy, but I guess it was all for nothing...)]
 21:  239| [45] [Jun had come to think of herself as worthless due to the all those long years spent unloved by her father.]
 22:  246| [45] [She felt like she was about to burst into tears from all the loneliness... but then someone called out to her.]
 23:  279| [47] [Nagisa]
 24:  282| [45] ["Are you crying, Jun...?"]
 25:  290| [47] [Jun]
 26:  293| [45] ["Oh... Nagisa."]
 27:  304| [45] [Jun looked up to find that the voice belonged to none other than "Nagisa", a girl who lived nearby.]
 28:  309| [45] [Jun gave her a cheery smile.]
 29:  317| [47] [Jun]
 30:  320| [45] ["Nuh-uh, I'm A-OK."]
 31:  346| [47] [Nagisa]
 32:  349| [45] ["I see. Thank goodness."]
 33:  357| [47] [Jun]
 34:  360| [45] ["Anyway, what's up with you, Nagisa? You sure it's okay to be going to the park all alone?"]
 35:  386| [47] [Nagisa]
 36:  389| [45] ["I'm not alone. Sis came with me, but she fell asleep."]
 37:  465| [45] [Nagisa pointed to a young woman sleeping on the lawn-- Nagisa's older sister, "Kazami".]
 38:  473| [47] [Jun]
 39:  476| [45] ["Oh brother... Then do you wanna play with me?"]
 40:  533| [47] [Nagisa]
 41:  536| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 42:  541| [45] [Nagisa's face brightened at Jun's suggestion.]
 43:  546| [45] [--Though Jun and Nagisa were five years apart in age, they got along great.]
 44:  551| [45] [They'd been best friends ever since they'd met at a neighborhood association meeting.]
 45:  574| [45] [Jun was a self-assertive tomboy, yet she acted like a kind older sister to Nagisa.]
 46:  579| [45] [Nagisa's body was a bit weak, so she apparently couldn't play all that much with other kids her age.]
 47:  584| [45] [That's why Jun made it her mission to play with her as much as possible whenever they crossed paths.]
 48:  589| [45] [And hanging out with Nagisa was also a way of healing Jun's heart.]
 49:  594| [47] [Jun]
 50:  595| [45] [(Why did Daddy say I shouldn't be playing with such a good girl...?)]
 51:  649| [45] [Jun's recent fight with her father had been caused by him saying "I don't want you playing with that kid in the park anymore".]
 52:  654| [45] ["That kid in the park" referred to Nagisa.]
 53:  659| [47] [Jun]
 54:  660| [45] [(This is Daddy we're talking here, so he's probably just being prejudiced or whatever it's called...)]
 55:  677| [45] [Jun played with Nagisa as she thought that--]
 56:  698| [45] [And it wasn't long before she noticed Kazami frantically running over to them.]
 57:  735| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  738| [45] ["J-Jun! I'm so sorry you had to watch over Nagisa for me!"]
 59:  746| [47] [Jun]
 60:  749| [45] ["Oh, Kazami. Nah, it's cool, I was having fun too."]
 61:  775| [47] [Nagisa]
 62:  778| [45] ["You were sleeping like a log, Sis, so I didn't wanna wake you up..."]
 63:  804| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  807| [45] ["I can't believe I dozed off like that... It must be because it's so nice and warm today..."]
 65:  812| [45] [Jun and Nagisa laughed at Kazami's embarrassed reaction.]
 66:  838| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  841| [45] ["... Oh my, it looks like it's already past noon now. Why don't we go home and I'll fix you up some lunch?"]
 68:  867| [47] [Nagisa]
 69:  870| [45] ["Yeah! I'm starving!"]
 70:  896| [47] [Kazami]
 71:  899| [45] ["Would you like some too as thanks, Jun? It won't be anything more than spaghetti, but still."]
 72:  907| [47] [Jun]
 73:  910| [45] ["For real!? Yay! Your spaghetti is the best, Kazami!"]
 74:  936| [47] [Kazami]
 75:  939| [45] ["Oh, why thank you. Then shall we get going?"]
 76:  944| [45] [Kazami took Jun and Nagisa hand in hand and headed off towards the Tachibana residence.]
 77:  993| [45] [--The Tachibana sisters had no parents.]
 78:  998| [45] [They had both died from illness at a young age, so Kazami worked at a flower shop to support Nagisa.]
 79: 1003| [45] [Kazami was a very kind and beautiful sister who always smelled of flowers.]
 80: 1008| [45] [As a result, Nagisa never grew up feeling worthless like Jun did.]
 81: 1013| [45] [Jun loved the two sisters dearly.]
 82: 1098| [47] [Kazami]
 83: 1101| [45] ["Hey, what flavor spaghetti would you girls like?"]
 84: 1109| [47] [Jun]
 85: 1112| [45] ["Um, what do you think sounds good, Nagisa?"]
 86: 1138| [47] [Nagisa]
 87: 1141| [45] ["I wanna have that egg kind we ate that one day!"]
 88: 1167| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1170| [45] ["You mean carbonara, huh? Okay, I'll make it extra tasty just for you."]
 90: 1175| [45] [Kazami smiled at Nagisa.]
 91: 1180| [45] [Jun felt a warm feeling spread through her chest at that sight.]
 92: 1185| [45] [--The sisters always looked so happy even though they didn't have parents.]
 93: 1190| [45] [Every part of their home was filled with the warmth and smiles a family should have.]
 94: 1195| [47] [Jun]
 95: 1196| [45] [(Man... they look so happy.)]
 96: 1201| [45] [Jun gripped Kazami's hand tightly as she thought this.]
