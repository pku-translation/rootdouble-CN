  1:   91| [45] [--As soon as they arrived at school, they heard the usual clamor of telepathy.]
  2:  209| [85] [{Ms. Munakataaa,]
  3:  211| [85] [ good morning!}]
  4:  222| [86] [Youthful Boy]

  6:  229| [85] [{Even if you turn me down,]

 10:  253| [85] [{Y-you again!?}]
 11:  264| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 12:  265| [86] [{Y-you again!?}]
 13:  271| [85] [{How many times do I have to tell you]
 14:  273| [85] [ to stop saying those things]
 15:  275| [85] [ with untargeted telepathy!?}]
 16:  291| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 17:  292| [86] [{How many times do I have to tell you to stop saying those things with untargeted telepathy!?}]
 18:  297| [85] [{More importantly,]
 19:  299| [85] [ who are you even!?]
 20:  301| [85] [Why can't you just confess]
 21:  303| [85] [ verbally like a man!?}]
 22:  314| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 23:  315| [86] [{More importantly, who are you even!? Why can't you just confess verbally like a man!?}]
 24:  323| [85] [{I'm too shy...]
 25:  325| [85] [This is the only way]
 26:  327| [85] [I can confess to you.}]
 27:  338| [86] [Youthful Boy]
 28:  339| [86] [{I'm too shy... This is the only way I can confess to you.}]
 29:  345| [85] [{Does it look like I care!?]
 30:  347| [85] [ I don't even know]
 31:  349| [85] [ your characteristic brain waveform,]
 32:  351| [85] [ so you're making ME]
 33:  353| [85] [ use untargeted telepathy too,]
 34:  355| [85] [ you know!?}]
 35:  366| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 36:  367| [86] [{Does it look like I care!? I don't even know your characteristic brain waveform, so you're making ME use untargeted telepathy too, you know!?}]
 37:  373| [85] [{Agh, forget it!}]

 39:  390| [86] [{Agh, forget it!}]

 48:  448| [86] [Batter]
 49:  449| [86] [{What!? A curve ball!?}]
 50:  461| [85] [{How's that!?]
 51:  463| [85] [ Psychological warfare]

 53:  476| [86] [Catcher]

 55:  487| [85] [{Dammit, wipe that smug look off your face...!}]

 58:  509| [85] [{Be honest with me, Shin...]
 59:  511| [85] [ Have our secret talks]
 60:  513| [85] [ always been leaking out]
 61:  515| [85] [ to the entire school?}]
 62:  526| [86] [Stupid Boy]
 63:  527| [86] [{Be honest with me, Shin... Have our secret talks always been leaking out to the entire school?}]
 64:  536| [85] [{Yeah... damn.]
 65:  538| [85] [ I didn't realize either]
 66:  540| [85] [ until yesterday.}]
 67:  551| [86] [Calm Boy]
 68:  552| [86] [{Yeah... damn. I didn't realize either until yesterday.}]
 69:  560| [85] [{It's no wonder]
 70:  562| [85] [ the girls give me cold stares...}]
 71:  573| [86] [Stupid Boy]
 72:  574| [86] [{It's no wonder the girls give me cold stares...}]
 73:  581| [85] [{We can't let things go on like this...]
 74:  583| [85] [ time for some secret training.}]
 75:  600| [86] [Calm Boy]
 76:  601| [86] [{We can't let things go on like this... time for some secret training.}]
 77:  615| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro walked down the hallway, trying to ignore the noise.]
 78:  725| [45] [--And once they got into the classroom and sat in their seats, the bell rang.]
 79:  794| [45] [Soon enough, Ena walked in.]
 80:  890| [47] [Ena]
 81:  893| [45] ["Good morning, everyone!"]
 82:  898| [47] [Students]
 83:  901| [45] ["Good morning."]
 84:  924| [47] [Ena]
 85:  927| [45] ["Mmhmm, that's what I like to hear."]
 86:  950| [47] [Ena]
 87:  953| [45] ["Now then, we've got a little surprise for you all today."]
 88:  961| [47] [Ena]
 89:  964| [45] ["A brand new friend is joining our class!"]
 90:  976| [47] [Male Student 1]
 91:  979| [45] ["Woah, a transfer student!?"]
 92:  984| [47] [Male Student 2]
 93:  987| [45] ["Is it a girl?"]
 94: 1010| [47] [Ena]
 95: 1013| [45] ["Indeed she is. Now then, Ms. Sannomiya, please come in~"]
 96: 1035| [45] [Ena turned to the door and called to someone outside.]
 97: 1104| [45] [And in response, a short girl walked into the classroom.]
 98: 1136| [47] [Girl]
 99: 1139| [45] ["..."]
100: 1147| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1150| [45] ["!?"]
102: 1155| [45] [Natsuhiko had seen that girl before.]
103: 1223| [47] [Male Student 1]
104: 1226| [45] ["Woah~! No way! A blondie!?"]
105: 1231| [47] [Female Student 1]
106: 1234| [45] ["I-is she half-Japanese...?"]
107: 1239| [47] [Female Student 2]
108: 1242| [45] ["She's so tiny and cute~!"]
109: 1247| [47] [Male Student 2]
110: 1250| [45] ["Isn't she a little -too- tiny? What, is she an elementary schooler?"]
111: 1255| [45] [The introduction of the sweet, precious little girl had the class ecstatic.]
112: 1338| [45] [But in contrast to the excitement, Natsuhiko's face merely went stiff.]
113: 1343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1344| [45] [(That girl...!)]
115: 1423| [45] [--There was no doubt about it.]
116: 1428| [45] [That was the very same girl that had been staring at Natsuhiko and Mashiro at the scene of the accident yesterday.]
117: 1497| [45] [Even the stuffed animal in her arms looked familiar. She had to be the same girl.]
118: 1502| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1503| [45] [(That girl... is now my classmate...?)]
120: 1616| [47] [Ena]
121: 1619| [45] ["Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself now."]
122: 1649| [45] [At that signal, the girl opened her lips.]
123: 1675| [47] [Sannomiya]
124: 1678| [45] ["Louise Yui Sannomiya."]
125: 1683| [45] [... And that was it. That was apparently all she had to say about herself.]
126: 1733| [47] [Ena]
127: 1736| [45] ["... Uhm~ Ms. Sannomiya's mother is from France, and so she's been living there most her life."]
128: 1762| [47] [Ena]
129: 1765| [45] ["She hasn't had much experience with Japanese culture, so she might feel a little lost, but--"]
130: 1791| [47] [Sannomiya]
131: 1794| [45] ["No, I don't feel particularly lost. There's no need for concern."]
132: 1820| [47] [Ena]
133: 1823| [45] ["O-oh...? W-well, if you say so..."]
134: 1828| [45] [She shut Ena down in fluent Japanese.]
135: 1833| [45] [But Ena quickly recovered and continued where she left off.]
136: 1859| [47] [Ena]
137: 1862| [45] ["... Uhm, Ms. Sannomiya is only 13 years old, but she skipped grades and was admitted into this class."]
138: 1867| [47] [Male Student 1]
139: 1870| [45] ["Incredible! So she's one 'a those child prodigies!?"]
140: 1896| [47] [Ena]
141: 1899| [45] ["Perhaps, but before that, she's still a member of your class.%NSo get along with her, okay everyone?"]
142: 1904| [47] [Students]
143: 1907| [45] ["Okay~"]
144: 1912| [45] [Ever since around 2025, even Japanese schools started allowing for students to skip grades, so a 13-year-old high schooler was not entirely out of the ordinary.]
145: 1917| [45] [But they were still uncommon. This was the first time Natsuhiko had actually seen one.]
146: 1943| [47] [Ena]
147: 1946| [45] ["Well then, Ms. Sannomiya. Homeroom is about to begin, so please take a seat for now."]
148: 1954| [47] [Ena]
149: 1957| [45] ["Your seat will be in the very back by the window."]
150: 1962| [45] [Ena pointed to the seat next to Mashiro's.]
151: 1988| [47] [Sannomiya]
152: 1991| [45] ["Understood."]
153: 2104| [45] [Acknowledging the teacher indifferently, the girl named Sannomiya started walking to her new seat.]
154: 2127| [45] [Her gaze locked upon Natsuhiko the entire way.]
155: 2196| [47] [Sannomiya]
156: 2197| [45] ["..."]
157: 2202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2203| [45] [(Wh-what's with her...?)]
159: 2236| [45] [But she said nothing, slipping in beside Natsuhiko to reach her seat.]
160: 2299| [47] [Mashiro]
161: 2302| [45] ["Hey, Natsuhiko. She's pretty cute, huh?"]
162: 2318| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2321| [45] ["Yeah, she sure is..."]
164: 2347| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 2350| [45] ["She's kinda like a doll, isn't she? I guess half-Japanese girls really are cute."]
166: 2358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2361| [45] ["True, I guess there might be a genetic component to it, but..."]
168: 2366| [45] [Regardless of how he put it, she was an eye-catchingly beautiful girl.]
169: 2392| [47] [Mashiro]
170: 2395| [45] ["But it kinda looked like she was staring at you, huh, Natsuhiko?"]
171: 2406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2409| [45] ["She's like a doll, even..."]
173: 2417| [47] [Mashiro]
174: 2420| [45] ["It kinda looked like she was staring at you, huh, Natsuhiko?"]
175: 2425| [45] [Natsuhiko answered Mashiro's casual question while hiding his unrest.]
176: 2433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2436| [45] ["... Maybe, I guess."]
178: 2444| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 2447| [45] ["You don't know her by any chance, do you?"]
180: 2455| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 2458| [45] ["No..."]
182: 2484| [47] [Mashiro]
183: 2487| [45] ["Hmm? But things are getting pretty interesting, don't you think?"]
184: 2495| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2498| [45] ["Huh? Interesting how?"]
186: 2524| [47] [Mashiro]
187: 2527| [45] ["We got a half-Japanese transfer student! How often does that happen? We gotta make friends with her for sure!"]
188: 2535| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 2538| [45] ["... You sure are infatuated with her."]
190: 2607| [45] [As they spoke, Ena continued on with homeroom.]
191: 2612| [45] [And after a few short announcements--]
192: 2698| [47] [Ena]
193: 2701| [45] ["Okay, that's the end of morning homeroom. See you this afternoon, everyone~"]
194: 2737| [45] [Ena departed the classroom with a farewell.]
195: 2805| [45] [And as if waiting for that cue, all the girls made a beeline to Sannomiya's desk.]
196: 2911| [47] [Female Student 1]
197: 2914| [45] ["Hey, hey, Ms. Sannomiya, where in France did you live?"]
198: 2919| [47] [Female Student 2]
199: 2922| [45] ["What do you like to do on your days off?"]
200: 2927| [47] [Female Student 3]
201: 2930| [45] ["Why'd you move at such an odd time?"]
202: 2935| [45] [In light of all of these questions--]
203: 2961| [47] [Sannomiya]
204: 2964| [45] ["I lived in Andresy."]
205: 2972| [47] [Sannomiya]
206: 2975| [45] ["I read on my days off."]
207: 2983| [47] [Sannomiya]
208: 2986| [45] ["I moved because of family circumstances."]
209: 3012| [47] [Sannomiya]
210: 3015| [45] ["That's all. Anything else?"]
211: 3020| [45] [She answered all of the questions in one breath and then looked at each of the girls.]
212: 3025| [45] [The girls fell silent at her intense gaze.]
213: 3030| [47] [Female Student 1]
214: 3033| [45] ["Ah..."]
215: 3041| [47] [Sannomiya]
216: 3044| [45] ["Is there a problem with that?"]
217: 3049| [47] [Female Student 2]
218: 3052| [45] ["No, there's not really a problem, but..."]
219: 3057| [47] [Female Student 3]
220: 3060| [45] ["Well, you know, we were kinda worried you might be having trouble adapting to an environment where everyone's older than you, so..."]
221: 3065| [47] [Female Student 1]
222: 3068| [45] ["Ah, yeah, that. So we thought we'd try to come and bring up a conversation for you..."]
223: 3094| [47] [Sannomiya]
224: 3097| [45] ["No need for your concern. I don't want any special treatment for my age."]
225: 3105| [47] [Sannomiya]
226: 3108| [45] ["An age difference of two or three years is not very significant relative to the human lifespan."]
227: 3113| [47] [Female Student 1]
228: 3116| [45] ["Ah, yeah, I guess..."]
229: 3142| [47] [Sannomiya]
230: 3145| [45] ["Understand? Then please, if you would treat me normally."]
231: 3168| [45] [Sannomiya bluntly answered as she took a paperback book out of her bag.]
232: 3173| [45] [Not an ounce of warmth could be felt from her voice.]
233: 3343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3344| [45] [(... What was that all about?)]
235: 3349| [45] [Did she just not like being interrogated? Or was that a show of her pride as a child prodigy?]
236: 3354| [45] [In any case, she definitely seemed the type to distance herself from other people.]
237: 3398| [47] [Female Student 1]
238: 3401| [45] ["... Ahahah, sorry for speaking out to you so suddenly."]
239: 3406| [47] [Female Student 2]
240: 3409| [45] ["... Hey, let's go."]
241: 3414| [47] [Female Student 3]
242: 3417| [45] ["Yeah..."]
243: 3440| [45] [One by one, the girls left Sannomiya alone.]
244: 3445| [45] [-- But that didn't discourage a certain other girl from approaching her.]
245: 3487| [47] [Mashiro]
246: 3490| [45] ["Hey, bonjour! Mademoiselle Louise?"]
247: 3495| [45] [It was Mashiro. Sannomiya shuddered for a second before glaring at her.]
248: 3521| [47] [Sannomiya]
249: 3524| [45] ["...?"]
250: 3550| [47] [Mashiro]
251: 3553| [45] ["H-huh? Bon...jouuuur?"]
252: 3579| [47] [Sannomiya]
253: 3582| [45] ["... Bonjour."]
254: 3608| [47] [Mashiro]
255: 3611| [45] ["Oh, good, my bonjour got through to you. Thank goodness. I wasn't too sure of myself there."]
256: 3634| [47] [Sannomiya]
257: 3635| [45] ["..."]
258: 3658| [45] [Awkward silence.]
259: 3681| [45] [Mashiro darted her eyes back and forth, perhaps looking for a topic of conversation, before resting those eyes on the book Sannomiya was holding.]
260: 3707| [47] [Mashiro]
261: 3710| [45] ["... Oh, I see you like reading. How tasteful. One of my friends loves books too, actually."]
262: 3736| [47] [Sannomiya]
263: 3739| [45] ["Really."]
264: 3765| [47] [Mashiro]
265: 3768| [45] ["I've read that book too. That's a famous sci-fi young adult fiction masterpiece, right?"]
266: 3791| [47] [Sannomiya]
267: 3792| [45] ["..."]
268: 3818| [47] [Mashiro]
269: 3821| [45] ["R-right...?"]
270: 3826| [47] [Sannomiya]
271: 3827| [45] ["..."]
272: 3832| [45] [No matter what Mashiro said, Sannomiya would not humor her with a proper reply.]
273: 3837| [45] [Natsuhiko held his breath, watching their little exchange out of the corner of his eye.]
274: 3863| [47] [Sannomiya]
275: 3866| [45] ["... What do you need?"]
276: 3892| [47] [Mashiro]
277: 3895| [45] ["Huh? Ah, no, well..."]
278: 3921| [47] [Mashiro]
279: 3924| [45] ["Since we're classmates from now on, you know~ I thought maybe we should be friends."]
280: 3929| [45] [Mashiro said, heeding Sannomiya's wish not to be treated as a younger child.]
281: 3952| [47] [Sannomiya]
282: 3953| [45] ["..."]
283: 3958| [45] [However, Sannomiya herself merely furrowed her eyebrows in displeasure.]
284: 3963| [47] [Natsuhiko]
285: 3964| [45] [(That's enough, Mashiro... Give up. She's clearly rejecting you.)]
286: 3969| [45] [Natsuhiko was about to stop Mashiro-- but right before he could, Sannomiya murmured.]
287: 3995| [47] [Sannomiya]
288: 3998| [45] ["... Suit yourself."]
289: 4024| [47] [Natsuhiko]
290: 4027| [45] ["!?"]
291: 4032| [45] [An unexpected reaction. He was sure she was going to reject her.]
292: 4102| [47] [Mashiro]
293: 4105| [45] ["Yay! So allow me to make a proper introduction!"]
294: 4131| [47] [Mashiro]
295: 4134| [45] ["I'm Mashiro Toba, and this is my friend, Natsuhiko!"]
296: 4206| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 4209| [45] ["Wait, what?"]
298: 4214| [45] [Natsuhiko jumped, startled to hear his own name come up.]
299: 4222| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 4225| [45] ["H-hey, Mashiro... don't just go introducing me on your own."]
301: 4251| [47] [Mashiro]
302: 4254| [45] ["What're you being so stiff for? A friend of a friend is a friend, right?"]
303: 4280| [47] [Mashiro]
304: 4283| [45] ["Now, now, go greet her properly. You -are- her elder."]
305: 4331| [45] [Mashiro pulled Natsuhiko to his feet by the arm.]
306: 4336| [45] [So there was really no way he could back down at that point.]
307: 4449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 4452| [45] ["Ah... well, I'm Natsuhiko Tenkawa. Nice to meet you."]
309: 4460| [47] [Sannomiya]
310: 4463| [45] ["... Nice to meet you."]
311: 4489| [47] [Mashiro]
312: 4492| [45] ["Now, then, what should we call you?"]
313: 4518| [47] [Mashiro]
314: 4521| [45] ["Ms. Sannomiya. Louise. Yui-Yui... They're all so cute, I just can't pick one."]
315: 4547| [47] [Sannomiya]
316: 4550| [45] ["It doesn't really matter which--"]
317: 4576| [47] [Mashiro]
318: 4579| [45] ["Oh, I know! I'll jam all three together and call you 'Salyu'. How's that!?"]
319: 4587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
320: 4590| [45] ["Woah, woah, Mashiro. Giving her a nickname right off the bat...? Don't you think you're jumping the gun just a little?"]
321: 4662| [47] [Mashiro]
322: 4665| [45] ["Not at all, not at all. Remember what Yuuri used to say? Making nicknames is a surefire way to bridge the distance between friends."]
323: 4691| [47] [Mashiro]
324: 4694| [45] ["So, how about it? How does Salyu sound? I think it's cute, personally~"]
325: 4720| [47] [Salyu]
326: 4723| [45] ["Hmm... well, I don't see why not."]
327: 4749| [47] [Mashiro]
328: 4752| [45] ["Really!?"]
329: 4757| [45] [Mashiro nodded to herself repeatedly.]
330: 4771| [47] [Natsuhiko]
331: 4772| [45] [(Huh...)]
332: 4777| [45] [Natsuhiko was a little surprised at how easily the nickname was approved.]
333: 4785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
334: 4788| [45] ["That sure was easy... What, did you happen to like that nickname?"]
335: 4814| [47] [Salyu]
336: 4817| [45] ["I guess."]
337: 4822| [45] [She answered quite simply.]
338: 4827| [45] [But did she really like it, or was she just sick of Mashiro talking and wanted to get it over with--?]
339: 4832| [47] [Natsuhiko]
340: 4833| [45] [(Probably the latter, I'd say.)]
341: 4859| [47] [Mashiro]
342: 4862| [45] ["Eheheh. So, Salyu, once again, nice to meet you."]
343: 4871| [47] [Natsuhiko]
344: 4872| [45] [(Hmm, so she got her approval on the first try...)]
345: 4877| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Mashiro would often give her friends nicknames in the past.]
346: 4882| [45] [Perhaps that helped her grow socially.]
347: 4890| [47] [Natsuhiko]
348: 4893| [45] ["Good job, Mashiro. Looks like she likes it."]
349: 4919| [47] [Mashiro]
350: 4922| [45] ["Yup! Eheheh, Salyu~?"]
351: 4951| [47] [Mashiro]
352: 4954| [45] ["So, Salyu, once again, nice to meet you."]
353: 4980| [47] [Salyu]
354: 4983| [45] ["... Mm."]
355: 4988| [45] [Sannomiya, now christened "Salyu", had begun the day with a thoroughly cold attitude.]
356: 4993| [45] [But just like that, she was gradually eased into becoming Mashiro and Natsuhiko's new "friend"...]
