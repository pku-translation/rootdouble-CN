  1:   69| [45] [Jun's face and voice were strained, as if she were trying to hide her fear.]
  2:   74| [47] [Watase]
  3:   75| [45] [(That's right... Moribe's gotta be scared too.)]
  4:   80| [45] ["8650 mSv"--a level of radiation that'd most certainly kill you if you were exposed to it for a mere hour.]
  5:   85| [45] [It was highly unlikely that anyone could look at that number without feeling the slightest ounce of fear.]
  6:   90| [45] [Yet here Jun was, hiding that.]
  7:   95| [47] [Watase]
  8:   96| [45] [(To think a body that small is brimming with so much courage...!)]
  9:  101| [45] [Watase spoke to Jun, making sure to hide his admiration.]
 10:  109| [47] [Watase]
 11:  112| [45] ["... You're right about that. You need two people to go into that contaminated zone or it won't work."]
 12:  120| [47] [Jun]
 13:  123| [45] ["Yeah, you can search much faster that way--"]
 14:  131| [47] [Watase]
 15:  134| [45] ["No, I'm talking about if one of us faints."]
 16:  195| [47] [Jun]
 17:  198| [45] ["!!"]
 18:  206| [47] [Watase]
 19:  209| [45] ["You can't believe that lightning won't strike twice. Just because you didn't faint last time doesn't mean you won't this time either."]
 20:  217| [47] [Watase]
 21:  220| [45] ["That's why two of us need to go. If one of us passes out, the other one can carry them."]
 22:  246| [47] [Jun]
 23:  249| [45] ["So we're putting our lives into each other's hands?"]
 24:  257| [47] [Watase]
 25:  260| [45] ["Yeah, exactly."]
 26:  286| [47] [Jun]
 27:  289| [45] ["... Man, that has a nice ring to it."]
 28:  294| [45] [Jun's strained face slowly changed.]
 29:  299| [45] [A bold smile soon took its place.]
 30:  307| [47] [Jun]
 31:  310| [45] ["Don'tcha know, Captain? They call that the 'buddy system'."]
 32:  318| [47] [Watase]
 33:  321| [45] ["Buddy system?"]
 34:  329| [47] [Jun]
 35:  332| [45] ["It means that we're 'partners'."]
 36:  358| [47] [Jun]
 37:  361| [45] ["Trusting your buddy and having their trust is more important than anything else in our line of work when we're on the job."]
 38:  369| [47] [Jun]
 39:  372| [45] ["The Lieutenant and I are normally buddies-- but today, there's no doubt that you and I are partners."]
 40:  380| [47] [Watase]
 41:  383| [45] ["Partners, huh... that does sound nice."]
 42:  388| [45] [Watase returned Jun's smile.]
 43:  393| [45] [It was likely that their two smiles were mirroring each other.]
 44:  398| [45] [The two of them silently held out their hands, then shared a firm handshake.]
 45:  406| [47] [Watase]
 46:  409| [45] ["... Listen up. We'll limit our search to three minutes."]
 47:  417| [47] [Watase]
 48:  420| [45] ["If we run out of time, then drop whatever you're doing and get back here."]
 49:  446| [47] [Jun]
 50:  449| [45] ["Yeah, that time limit sounds about right. It'll all be for nothing if we both pass out, after all."]
 51:  457| [47] [Watase]
 52:  460| [45] ["Also, make sure to keep this a secret from Tachibana."]
 53:  486| [47] [Jun]
 54:  489| [45] ["You don't even have to ask! I don't want to give her another thing to worry about!"]
 55:  494| [45] [Watase and Jun set their watch timers to three minutes, then turned back to the gate.]
 56:  502| [47] [Watase]
 57:  505| [45] ["Okay, ready to go, partner!?"]
 58:  531| [47] [Jun]
 59:  534| [45] ["YEAH!"]
 60:  582| [45] [They both let out a gallant cry and charged straight into the contaminated zone.]
