  1:  151| [45] [--Once he and Natsuhiko had formed their pact to team up--]
  2:  223| [45] [Watase first retrieved his gun from Natsuhiko.]
  3:  228| [45] [He figured he'd need a weapon for self-defense since he didn't known what dangers were lurking out there.]
  4:  242| [45] [Natsuhiko had been a bit reluctant, but he ultimately complied.]
  5:  336| [45] [Watase then addressed the two kids before he left them in the shelter.]
  6:  344| [47] [Watase]
  7:  347| [45] ["Just to reiterate, you guys mustn't leave here at all."]
  8:  355| [47] [Watase]
  9:  358| [45] ["We don't know for sure who's been infected with malice, so we don't know what thoughts are driving them either. Consider everyone except me to be an enemy."]
 10:  384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  387| [45] ["... Yeah, I know."]
 12:  413| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  416| [45] ["The shelter door only opens if you punch in the password from the inside. And we're not gonna be dumb enough to do that unless you call for us."]
 14:  421| [45] [--Natsuhiko was no longer speaking formally with Watase.]
 15:  426| [47] [Watase]
 16:  427| [45] [(... Well, I guess this is just how he normally talks to people.)]
 17:  432| [45] [Besides, it would have been weird for him to treat Watase with respect when he's the terrorist who attacked Yuuri and shot him and Mashiro.]
 18:  437| [45] [It felt odd to Watase having kids their age treat him like an equal, but this way probably fit Watase and Natsuhiko's relationship better anyway.]
 19:  463| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  466| [45] ["... Okay, I'll be counting on you, Watase. Make sure you keep your promise with Yuuri."]
 21:  474| [47] [Watase]
 22:  477| [45] ["Of course. Okay then, I'm off now. Take care of Yuuri."]
 23:  533| [45] [Watase was about to run past the steel door when he heard a voice call out to him from behind.]
 24:  565| [47] [Yuuri]
 25:  568| [45] ["Um, Captain Kasasagi."]
 26:  576| [47] [Watase]
 27:  579| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 28:  605| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  608| [45] ["... Please be careful, okay?"]
 30:  616| [47] [Watase]
 31:  619| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 32:  669| [45] [Watase gave a wry smile and left the shelter.]
 33:  726| [45] [He thought back to the conversation he'd had with Natsuhiko earlier as he walked with extreme caution.]
 34:  731| [47] [Watase]
 35:  732| [45] [(Keep your promise, huh...)]
 36:  737| [45] [It went without saying that Watase intended to do so.]
 37:  742| [45] [He never planned on getting others involved with this terrorist plot to begin with.]
 38:  747| [45] [Since he was the one who inadvertently dragged everyone into this mess, he had a responsibility to get them out of the facility safely.]
 39:  752| [45] [But he had qualms about his mission to take Yuuri away with him once they had escaped.]
 40:  757| [45] [It was true that he would have caused this whole incident for absolutely nothing if he didn't bring at least one test subject back.]
 41:  762| [45] [Then the Rokumei City government's wrongdoings would never come to light, and their cover-ups would just continue unabated.]
 42:  767| [45] [But was Yuuri really okay with going with him? And what about Natsuhiko?]
 43:  772| [45] [Naturally, there was no chance in hell he wanted that.]
 44:  841| [47] [Watase]
 45:  842| [45] [(... Completing the mission might necessitate another confrontation with him.)]
 46:  858| [45] [But that was all in the future.]
 47:  863| [45] [For now, all he had to think about was living up to his word with Natsuhiko and keeping his promise with Yuuri.]
 48:  916| [47] [Watase]
 49:  917| [45] [(So to do that... first thing I've got to do is collect all the guns still lying around in the facility.)]
 50:  922| [45] [Much like him, Dojima and Hiyama had also brought guns into the facility.]
 51:  937| [45] [If no one had picked them up yet, that meant they were still lying around somewhere.]
 52:  985| [45] [Watase headed to Area 3 with that thought in mind.]
 53: 1036| [45] [--B1 Area 3, inner ring--]
 54: 1146| [45] [He went back into the room full of corpses.]
 55: 1151| [45] [He hadn't yet examined the place in detail.]
 56: 1156| [45] [The room was littered with the bodies of Dojima and the two unknown researchers, unmoved from where he had seen them last.]
 57: 1161| [45] [All the blood staining the place had completely dried up and turned black.]
 58: 1167| [45] [A dull yet fierce pain stung at Watase's heart when he saw the wretched form of his friend.]
 59: 1175| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1178| [45] ["Dojima...!"]
 61: 1183| [45] [Watase started to break out into choked sobs.]
 62: 1188| [45] [When Watase had amnesia, he hadn't felt the sorrow of having lost his best friend of ten years, but now it burst through like a waterfall.]
 63: 1244| [45] [They'd been fighting side by side ever since they joined the fire department. They both passed the rescue worker exam in the same year.]
 64: 1249| [45] [It wasn't long before their junior Hiyama joined in, and with their similar pasts, the three of them became brothers in arms who understood each other well.]
 65: 1254| [45] [And now they were both dead-- Dojima's body lay before him, with Hiyama's only an area away...]
 66: 1259| [45] [But no matter how painful their loss was, now was not the time for grief.]
 67: 1277| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1280| [45] ["... Dojima, Hiyama... I'll carry on your dying wishes."]
 69: 1288| [47] [Watase]
 70: 1291| [45] ["I will make sure that they're fulfilled...!"]
 71: 1296| [45] [Watase muttered that and looked up.]
 72: 1301| [45] [He then endured his sorrow and began diligently searching the room.]
 73: 1306| [45] [It wasn't long before he found two pistols lying around-- one in the corner of the room, the other under the desk.]
 74: 1403| [45] [They were both NZ-75s, just like Watase's. There was no doubt that they were Dojima's and Hiyama's.]
 75: 1408| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1409| [45] [(But... they're both out of bullets, huh.)]
 77: 1424| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama, infected with malice, had likely used up all their bullets on the researchers.]
 78: 1429| [45] [And yet in spite of that, Subject N had gotten away.]
 79: 1512| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1513| [45] [(I guess the malice contagion causes you to lose your composure too...)]
 81: 1518| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1519| [45] [(... But you couldn't help it, could you, Dojima?)]
 83: 1524| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1525| [45] [(We're rescue workers... We never learned how to kill people.)]
 85: 1531| [45] [Watase looked at the corner of the room with those bitter thoughts in mind.]
 86: 1536| [45] [The broken jackhammer was sitting there.]
 87: 1541| [45] [It was essential to their plan to escape through the pipe.]
 88: 1595| [45] [But even if he could repair it, it would take about three hours for it to destroy the pump in the intake pipe.]
 89: 1600| [45] [They wouldn't make it in time before the bomb went off.]
 90: 1605| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1606| [45] [(If worse comes to worst... do we need to find another escape route aside from the pipe?)]
 92: 1621| [45] [But where could they even find one?]
 93: 1626| [45] [Watase exited the corpse-littered room as he left that thought in a corner of his mind.]
 94: 1785| [45] [Once he was out in the hallway, he threw the two empty pistols to the floor.]
 95: 1867| [45] [He then stomped on them with all his might with his safety boots, destroying both the guns and the magazines.]
 96: 1880| [45] [That way, he didn't have to worry about someone picking one up later and misusing it.]
 97: 1934| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1935| [45] [(This means that the only guns left are my own and the one the old man has.)]
 99: 1940| [45] [It was a silver lining that not many people there had gotten their hands on guns.]
100: 1945| [45] [Now that he neutralized the threat those guns posed, Watase decided it was finally time to start searching for the people infected with malice.]
101: 1950| [47] [Watase]
102: 1951| [45] [(All right, the first one I should catch is old man Ukita.)]
103: 1956| [47] [Watase]
104: 1957| [45] [(This place is huge though, so to find him--)]
105: 1972| [45] [Watase thought, then soon found an answer.]
106: 2026| [45] [The surveillance room. There were still several live monitors there.]
107: 2031| [45] [If he used those, he could gain a slightly better idea of what was going on in the facility at the moment.]
108: 2046| [45] [He headed off for the surveillance room with that thought.]
109: 2100| [45] [--He slowly went down the staircase, being particularly careful to remain hidden and silent.]
110: 2105| [45] [His greatest fear was Ukita suddenly shooting him from a distance.]
111: 2110| [45] [But it'd actually be advantageous for Watase if he was able to physically spot Ukita first.]
112: 2115| [47] [Watase]
113: 2116| [45] [(It'll probably take him time to reload bullets too...)]
114: 2121| [47] [Watase]
115: 2122| [45] [(I should just run up to him and throw him to the floor.)]
116: 2127| [45] [Watase had trained in martial arts ever since he joined Q.]
117: 2132| [45] [Now that his memories were back, he fully remembered how to use all those skills.]
118: 2137| [47] [Watase]
119: 2138| [45] [(Never thought I'd have to use them on the old man, though.)]
120: 2190| [45] [He finished descending the staircase when he thought that.]
121: 2289| [45] [And just as soon as he left the stairwell--]
122: 2300| [45] [Watase heard a familiar voice.]
123: 2308| [47] [Ena]
124: 2311| [45] ["... sagi is with you too!?"]
125: 2319| [47] [Ukita]
126: 2322| [45] ["No, he's a traitor--..."]
127: 2345| [47] [Watase]
128: 2348| [45] ["!!"]
129: 2353| [45] [He heard voices apparently coming from a room right next to the staircase-- the surveillance room.]
130: 2359| [47] [Watase]
131: 2360| [45] [(Those voices... isn't that the old man and Teach!?)]
132: 2365| [47] [Watase]
133: 2366| [45] [(Shit, Teach is in danger!)]
134: 2372| [45] [Watase frantically dashed for the door to the surveillance room and opened it up.]
135: 2440| [47] [Watase]
136: 2443| [45] ["Stop it, old man! Don't hurt Te--...!?"]
137: 2449| [45] [Watase gasped before he completed his sentence.]
138: 2454| [45] [He had been rendered speechless by the most unexpected scene unfolding before him.]
139: 2509| [47] [Ena]
140: 2512| [45] ["!!"]
141: 2520| [47] [Ukita]
142: 2523| [45] ["!!"]
143: 2528| [45] [Ena and Ukita turned around in surprise.]
144: 2533| [45] [It wasn't Ukita who was attacking Ena-- it was -Ena- who was pointing a gun at Ukita.]
145: 2538| [47] [Watase]
146: 2539| [45] [(Wh-what the hell!? What's going on!?)]
147: 2547| [47] [Ena]
148: 2550| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... you...!"]
149: 2565| [45] [Ena glared at Watase with hostility.]
150: 2585| [47] [Watase]
151: 2586| [45] [(She's gonna shoot!?)]
152: 2591| [45] [Watase drew his body back in surprise--]
153: 2670| [45] [--only for Ena to run out of the room after a moment's hesitation.]
154: 2678| [47] [Watase]
155: 2681| [45] ["Wha... the hell was that all about!?"]
156: 2686| [45] [Watase stood there in shock. Just then, Ukita started talking to him in a low voice.]
157: 2720| [47] [Ukita]
158: 2723| [45] ["... That woman wasn't a mere teacher at all."]
159: 2731| [47] [Watase]
160: 2734| [45] ["What?"]
161: 2763| [47] [Ukita]
162: 2766| [45] ["I tried to take her magazine from her, but then she ended up stealing the gun from me..."]
163: 2792| [47] [Ukita]
164: 2795| [45] ["Then she threatened me. She said 'tell me everything you know right now or I'll shoot to kill'."]
165: 2824| [47] [Watase]
166: 2827| [45] ["...!"]
167: 2853| [47] [Ukita]
168: 2856| [45] ["Her intent to kill was the real thing. Next thing I knew, I was confessing everything to her..."]
169: 2882| [47] [Ukita]
170: 2885| [45] ["All about the terrorist plot and how you betrayed us halfway through!"]
171: 2893| [47] [Ukita]
172: 2896| [45] ["The plan's a failure! It's all over thanks to you!"]
173: 2958| [45] [Ukita lunged at Watase as he shouted that.]
174: 2981| [47] [Watase]
175: 2984| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
176: 3028| [47] [Ukita]
177: 3031| [45] ["You've got a gun too, right!? Give to me right now!"]
178: 3039| [47] [Ukita]
179: 3042| [45] ["That woman is probably an assassin sent by LABO! If we don't hunt her down and kill her now, she'll kill us!"]
180: 3047| [45] [Ukita tried to steal Watase's gun with bloodshot eyes. It was clear he was completely possessed by madness.]
181: 3052| [47] [Watase]
182: 3053| [45] [(--Dammit, is this also the malice's influence!?)]
183: 3075| [45] [Watase dodged around Ukita with little effort and circled behind him.]
184: 3114| [45] [He then wrapped his arm around the old man's neck and squeezed.]
185: 3128| [47] [Ukita]
186: 3131| [45] ["Kahh...!"]
187: 3136| [45] [It was a sleeper hold-- a technique to render someone powerless without actually harming them.]
188: 3141| [47] [Ukita]
189: 3142| [45] ["...--"]
190: 3149| [45] [Ukita's arms soon dangled limply.]
191: 3157| [47] [Watase]
192: 3160| [45] ["Phew... this should be fine, right, Natsuhiko?"]
193: 3209| [45] [Watase sighed heavily and picked up Ukita.]
194: 3220| [45] [He then ran back for the shelter.]
