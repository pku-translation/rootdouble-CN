  0:   60| [45] [--After being saved by those rescue workers--]
  1:   65| [45] [Jun was taken to the hospital, where she was treated for her burns.]
  2:   70| [45] ["The burn on your back will likely leave a scar."]
  3:   75| [45] [It had been depressing to hear that from her doctor, but there were more important matters on Jun's mind.]
  4:  104| [47] [Jun]
  5:  105| [45] [(... I hope Nagisa's okay...)]
  6:  110| [45] [That rescue worker said she was okay, but the wounds on her head were apparently more serious than what had been thought.]
  7:  115| [45] [Nagisa had been in the ICU for an entire day after the accident, and she was still there.]
  8:  120| [45] [It appeared that Kazami, who had come over as fast as she could, was praying for Nagisa's safety in front of the ICU the whole time.]
  9:  125| [45] [Jun also prayed from her hospital bed.]
 10:  130| [47] [Jun]
 11:  131| [45] [(... Oh God, please don't take Nagisa away...)]
 12:  183| [45] [But that night--]
 13:  188| [45] [As Jun struggled to fall asleep, Kazami suddenly came in.]
 14:  271| [47] [Jun]
 15:  274| [45] ["Oh, hey Kazami!"]
 16:  282| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  285| [45] ["Jun..."]
 18:  336| [45] [Kazami staggered into the sickroom.]
 19:  341| [45] [Something was off about her.]
 20:  349| [47] [Jun]
 21:  352| [45] ["... Hey, how's Nagisa...?"]
 22:  360| [47] [Jun]
 23:  363| [45] ["She's okay, right?"]
 24:  368| [45] [Kazami's face warped with grief at that question.]
 25:  394| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  397| [45] ["Jun... the truth is, Nagisa's... Nagisa's..."]
 27:  405| [47] [Jun]
 28:  408| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
 29:  459| [45] [Kazami broke down sobbing.]
 30:  464| [45] [With a trembling voice, she then told Jun about her sister's death...]
 31:  521| [45] [--April 7, 2021.]
 32:  526| [45] [The world was informed that four lives had perished in the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Gas Explosion Accident on that day.]
 33:  531| [45] [Nagisa's death was one of those tragedies.]
 34:  536| [45] [The debris that hit her head caused her to lose so much blood that she passed away in her sleep.]
 35:  541| [45] [Perhaps it was only a minor tragedy compared to the Great Rokumei City Arson of 2014.]
 36:  546| [45] [But Jun had lost something irreplaceable on that day.]
 37:  600| [45] [--Nagisa's funeral was held two days later.]
 38:  605| [45] [Though she was still recovering from her wounds, Jun forced herself to come.]
 39:  663| [45] [The sound of the sutras chanted by the Buddhist priest reverberated through the small funeral home.]
 40:  675| [47] [Buddhist Priest]
 41:  678| [45] ["--not created, not annihilated, not impure, not pure, not increasing, not decreasing. Therefore, in the void"]
 42:  689| [47] [Buddhist Priest]
 43:  692| [45] ["there are no forms and no feelings, conceptions, impulses and no consciousness: there is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind; there is no form, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea--..."]
 44:  697| [45] [Jun just stood there in a daze as she listened to his voice.]
 45:  769| [47] [Jun]
 46:  770| [45] [(Nagisa's... dead...)]
 47:  775| [47] [Jun]
 48:  776| [45] [(... The tears... just won't come...)]
 49:  792| [45] [She still couldn't believe that Nagisa had died.]
 50:  797| [47] [Jun]
 51:  798| [45] [(If I'd been stronger... then could I have prevented her from dying...?)]
 52:  803| [47] [Jun]
 53:  804| [45] [(Could I have saved her before the rescue workers got there...?)]
 54:  809| [45] [Feelings of powerlessness and resentment tormented Jun's heart.]
 55:  819| [45] [Kazami was staring at Nagisa's casket with empty eyes.]
 56:  824| [45] [All emotion had been drained from her face.]
 57:  832| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  835| [45] ["Nagisa..."]
 59:  840| [45] [Nagisa didn't reply to her faint call.]
 60:  845| [45] [Jun felt her heart wrench as she watched Kazami.]
 61:  894| [45] [--It appeared Kazami had much more trouble than Jun accepting that her beloved sister was now dead.]
 62:  899| [45] [For a little while after that, Kazami--]
 63:  904| [45] [--became mentally unstable.]
 64:  958| [45] [Jun first noticed sometime after she'd been discharged from the hospital.]
 65:  994| [45] [She had encountered Kazami on her way home from school. Kazami was walking around with the same empty eyes as during the funeral.]
 66: 1002| [47] [Jun]
 67: 1005| [45] ["Ah... where are you going, Kazami?"]
 68: 1059| [47] [Kazami]
 69: 1062| [45] ["Oh, Jun... have you seen Nagisa?"]
 70: 1070| [47] [Jun]
 71: 1073| [45] ["--Huh?"]
 72: 1099| [47] [Kazami]
 73: 1102| [45] ["She's really late."]
 74: 1110| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1113| [45] ["Geez, where could she have gone?"]
 76: 1136| [47] [Jun]
 77: 1139| [45] ["--...!"]
 78: 1144| [45] [Jun gasped as she saw Kazami talking as though Nagisa were still alive.]
 79: 1152| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1155| [45] ["K-Kazami... Nagisa's already..."]
 81: 1181| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1184| [45] ["Call me if you see her. It's almost time for dinner, you see."]
 83: 1222| [45] [Kazami walked off without hearing a word Jun had said.]
 84: 1270| [45] [The same thing happened over and over again each time Jun saw Kazami.]
 85: 1337| [45] [Kazami would always wander about the park Nagisa used to play in...]
 86: 1342| [45] [It was like she hadn't accepted Nagisa's death at all.]
 87: 1391| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1392| [45] [(What do I do...? Kazami will never recover if this keeps up...!)]
 89: 1397| [45] [But day after cruel day passed by as Jun remained at a loss for how she could help Kazami.]
 90: 1456| [45] [--Then two weeks later or so--]
 91: 1461| [45] [Jun kept the pain in her heart at bay as she headed to the park.]
 92: 1543| [47] [Jun]
 93: 1544| [45] [(Nagisa, tell me... What should I do...?)]
 94: 1549| [45] [Jun looked to the heavens and asked, hoping her voice would reach Nagisa.]
 95: 1668| [45] [It was at that moment she spotted Kazami standing at the edge of the park.]
 96: 1746| [45] [When she spotted Jun, she walked over to her on unstable feet.]
 97: 1781| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1784| [45] ["Oh, Jun... have you seen Nagisa?"]
 99: 1810| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1813| [45] ["She's really late. Geez, where could she have gone?"]
101: 1818| [45] [Kazami was saying the exact same things she had the other day.]
102: 1826| [47] [Jun]
103: 1829| [45] ["K-Kazami...!"]
104: 1834| [45] [Jun knew Kazami's heart was in pieces.]
105: 1839| [45] [Her time had stopped the moment her sister had died.]
106: 1865| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1868| [45] ["I have to hurry... and find her..."]
108: 1888| [45] [Kazami tried to walk off somewhere again with those words.]
109: 1893| [45] [But Jun--]
110: 1898| [45] [--called out to her.]
111: 1906| [47] [Jun]
112: 1909| [45] ["That's enough! That's enough, Kazami!"]
113: 1943| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1946| [45] ["Huh...?"]
115: 1954| [47] [Jun]
116: 1957| [45] ["You'll never find her no matter how much you look...! 'Cause no matter where you look, Nagisa's already gone!"]
117: 1980| [45] [Kazami's face froze over at that moment.]
118: 1988| [47] [Kazami]
119: 1991| [45] ["Wha... what are you talking about...?"]
120: 1999| [47] [Jun]
121: 2002| [45] ["Nagisa's dead! She got hit in the head in that explosion back then!"]
122: 2056| [47] [Kazami]
123: 2059| [45] ["You're lying... She must be somewhere--"]
124: 2067| [47] [Jun]
125: 2070| [45] ["I'm telling the truth!"]
126: 2078| [47] [Jun]
127: 2081| [45] ["You were at her funeral too, weren't you!? We said goodbye to Nagisa together, remember!?"]
128: 2086| [45] [Tears poured out of Jun's eyes in droves when she shouted that.]
129: 2094| [47] [Jun]
130: 2097| [45] ["... You have to understand that, Kazami...!"]
131: 2105| [47] [Jun]
132: 2108| [45] ["If you don't, then Nagisa can't go to Heaven in peace...!"]
133: 2113| [45] [It was with those words that Jun was also finally able to accept it.]
134: 2167| [45] [--Nagisa was dead.]
135: 2172| [45] [She would never see that tender-hearted girl ever again.]
136: 2177| [45] [She and Kazami were left behind in the world Nagisa was no longer a part of.]
137: 2182| [45] [Jun couldn't stop her tears from pouring out now that she realized that.]
138: 2197| [45] [And when she saw Jun's tears--]
139: 2223| [47] [Kazami]
140: 2226| [45] ["I see..."]
141: 2234| [47] [Kazami]
142: 2237| [45] ["So she's... dead, huh...?"]
143: 2242| [45] [Kazami also finally accepted reality.]
144: 2268| [47] [Kazami]
145: 2271| [45] ["... Now I'm all alone..."]
146: 2279| [47] [Jun]
147: 2282| [45] ["... No you're not. I know Nagisa's watching over you from Heaven."]
148: 2308| [47] [Kazami]
149: 2311| [45] ["No, I'm alone..."]
150: 2319| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2322| [45] ["... She was my only sister. The two of us had lived together just by ourselves for ages."]
152: 2348| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2351| [45] ["Without Nagisa, I'm..."]
154: 2356| [45] [Jun's words weren't reaching her.]
155: 2361| [45] [Jun desperately thought about how to move Kazami's heart. About how she could support her.]
156: 2366| [45] [She soon reached an answer-- and when she did, she finally stopped crying.]
157: 2374| [47] [Jun]
158: 2377| [45] ["--Kazami."]
159: 2382| [45] [Jun told Kazami her decision.]
160: 2390| [47] [Jun]
161: 2393| [45] ["I won't leave you alone."]
162: 2401| [47] [Jun]
163: 2404| [45] ["'Cause I'll be your little sister-- since Nagisa no longer can."]
164: 2430| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2433| [45] ["Huh...?"]
166: 2441| [47] [Jun]
167: 2444| [45] ["I know I'm nothing like her and that I'm not cute at all... but I'll be your little sister, Sis. So..."]
168: 2452| [47] [Jun]
169: 2455| [45] ["So..."]
170: 2481| [47] [Kazami]
171: 2484| [45] ["Jun... you..."]
172: 2489| [45] [Jun knew she could never in a million years replace Nagisa.]
173: 2494| [45] [But when Kazami heard her declaration--]
174: 2546| [45] [She gently embraced Jun and spoke.]
175: 2573| [47] [Kazami]
176: 2576| [45] ["... Thank you."]
177: 2631| [45] [--Jun became Kazami's new sister from that day on.]
178: 2636| [45] [She would stop by Kazami's house frequently after Nagisa's death.]
179: 2641| [45] [Occasionally, she'd stay over, and they'd spend the whole night talking to each other.]
180: 2646| [45] [In the end, it looked like her actions were worth it.]
181: 2651| [45] [Kazami slowly began returning to the calm person she'd been before the incident.]
182: 2708| [45] [She soon quit her job at the flower shop and entered firefighting school.]
183: 2713| [45] [Nagisa's death had most likely driven her to desire a job that involved saving lives.]
184: 2718| [45] [Jun was against it, but Kazami just wouldn't change her mind.]
185: 2723| [45] [Jun soon caved in and went from opposing her to supporting her.]
186: 2728| [45] [Kazami then became a firefighter, and after putting in even more work, she became a rescue worker.]
187: 2777| [45] [--All their sad and painful memories slowly faded with time.]
188: 2782| [45] [Jun deeply respected Kazami for completely getting back on her feet and becoming the first female rescue worker in Rokumei City Fire Department history.]
189: 2787| [47] [Jun]
190: 2788| [45] [(Sis sure is strong... I have to get stronger too.)]
191: 2793| [45] [With Jun supporting Kazami and Kazami serving as a role model to Jun, the two of them grew to have a mutual effect on each other.]
192: 2798| [45] [Then one day several years later...]
193: 2867| [45] [Kazami asked Jun a question as they went out to the city on one of their days off.]
194: 2875| [47] [Kazami]
195: 2878| [45] ["Jun, what do you plan to do once you've graduated high school?"]
196: 2886| [47] [Jun]
197: 2889| [45] ["Hmm, funny you ask that. See..."]
198: 2897| [47] [Jun]
199: 2900| [45] ["I was thinking I'd also enroll in firefighting school and work to become a member of Sirius, just like you, Sis."]
200: 2926| [47] [Kazami]
201: 2929| [45] ["What...!?"]
202: 2934| [45] [Just as Jun had feared, a grim look adorned Kazami's face after she'd heard Jun's nervous answer.]
203: 2960| [47] [Kazami]
204: 2963| [45] ["No, it's too dangerous for you! You could die out there!"]
205: 2971| [47] [Kazami]
206: 2974| [45] ["The pay is low, the job is hard, and it feels like you're diving straight into Hell every time you go to work--"]
207: 2982| [47] [Jun]
208: 2985| [45] ["I-I know all that."]
209: 2993| [47] [Jun]
210: 2996| [45] ["But you enrolled in firefighter school even after I kept telling you not to, remember?"]
211: 3022| [47] [Kazami]
212: 3025| [45] ["That was years ago. These are completely different issues."]
213: 3033| [47] [Jun]
214: 3036| [45] ["No they're not! They're the same!"]
215: 3062| [47] [Kazami]
216: 3065| [45] ["Jun, why...?"]
217: 3091| [47] [Kazami]
218: 3094| [45] ["If I ever lost you too, I'd be...!"]
219: 3099| [45] [Jun knew Kazami was truly worried about her.]
220: 3150| [45] [But there was no chance she could yield to her.]
221: 3155| [45] [Jun always felt like her heart was being crushed every time she heard a siren go off in the city or saw Kazami come home from work hurt.]
222: 3163| [47] [Jun]
223: 3166| [45] ["Sis, I feel the same way as you."]
224: 3174| [47] [Jun]
225: 3177| [45] ["I don't want you to leave me all by myself either."]
226: 3203| [47] [Kazami]
227: 3206| [45] ["Jun..."]
228: 3293| [47] [Jun]
229: 3296| [45] ["... I didn't fill in for Nagisa just so you could spoil me."]
230: 3304| [47] [Jun]
231: 3307| [45] ["I wanted to take up that role so I could protect you in her stead, too."]
232: 3333| [47] [Kazami]
233: 3336| [45] ["I see... that's true..."]
234: 3362| [47] [Kazami]
235: 3365| [45] ["... If that's how you really feel, then I won't stop you."]
236: 3370| [45] [Though she said that, Kazami was clearly a little angry.]
237: 3396| [47] [Kazami]
238: 3399| [45] ["... But you have to promise me that you'll treasure your own life as highly as you can, even when you're working."]
239: 3407| [47] [Jun]
240: 3410| [45] ["Of course I will. You better do the same, you hear?"]
241: 3436| [47] [Kazami]
242: 3439| [45] ["Yes... for you, I will."]
243: 3444| [45] [The two of them then exchanged smiles.]
244: 3455| [47] [Jun]
245: 3458| [45] ["And besides, I've admired rescue workers for ages now."]
246: 3466| [47] [Jun]
247: 3469| [45] ["... 'Cause it was a rescue worker who saved me."]
248: 3495| [47] [Kazami]
249: 3498| [45] ["I see... if that's how you really feel, then I have nothing else to say."]
250: 3503| [45] [Though she said that, Kazami was clearly a little angry.]
251: 3508| [45] [Jun then tried buttering her up.]
252: 3516| [47] [Jun]
253: 3519| [45] ["Hey, Sis?"]
254: 3545| [47] [Kazami]
255: 3548| [45] ["What?"]
256: 3556| [47] [Jun]
257: 3559| [45] ["If I do this, then I can save you whenever you're in a tight spot."]
258: 3585| [47] [Kazami]
259: 3588| [45] ["Thank you. Then I'll be sure to save you whenever you're in danger."]
260: 3596| [47] [Jun]
261: 3599| [45] ["Yeah!"]
262: 3604| [45] [As long as she held on to those words, Jun felt like she could do anything.]
