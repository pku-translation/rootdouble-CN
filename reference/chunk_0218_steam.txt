  1:   55| [45] [That was a path that only people authorized by LABO could traverse.]
  2:   60| [45] [A direct 10 km path without any forks or exits.]
  3:   65| [45] [Their footsteps echoed through the overwhelming silence.]
  4:   70| [45] [Eventually, Salyu looked to the side of the street and whispered.]
  5:  139| [47] [Salyu]
  6:  142| [45] ["Natsuhiko, another camera."]
  7:  240| [45] [On the other side of her gaze was a surveillance camera.]
  8:  248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  251| [45] ["Okay, then, Salyu, if you will."]
 10:  277| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  280| [45] ["Understood. Wait just a bit."]
 12:  310| [45] [Salyu softly stepped toward the surveillance camera post and connected Alice.]
 13:  315| [45] [They had already neutralized seven cameras like this.]
 14:  347| [47] [Mashiro]
 15:  350| [45] ["... We've already been walking for about an hour, huh?"]
 16:  376| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  379| [45] ["We're still about halfway, huh. Think we should hurry it up a bit?"]
 18:  387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  390| [45] ["No, let's slow down the pace. We'll get there even later if we use up all our stamina."]
 20:  395| [45] [Salyu returned as Natsuhiko finished speaking.]
 21:  449| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  452| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Mashiro, I'm done."]
 23:  460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  463| [45] ["Good. Salyu, let's walk from here on."]
 25:  489| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  492| [45] ["That would be wise. Judging by the state the inspection gate was in, I don't believe the terrorists have started heading to LABO yet."]
 27:  535| [45] [The kids walked off into the silence once more.]
 28:  540| [45] [A sense of loneliness overcame them, as if they had walked into a world all their own.]
 29:  605| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  608| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko."]
 31:  616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  619| [45] ["Hmm, what?"]
 33:  645| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  648| [45] ["You said we were going to go directly to LABO and tell them about the existence of a sleeper agent, but who exactly do you intend to tell?"]
 35:  656| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  659| [45] ["The security guards could secretly be criminals too like what happened with the PRC, right?"]
 37:  667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  670| [45] ["...!"]
 39:  675| [45] [That indeed was a possibility.]
 40:  680| [45] [The sleeper agent might not be Ukita. There might also be more than one.]
 41:  688| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  691| [45] ["Guess we've got no choice but to use empathy and look for someone we can trust..."]
 43:  696| [45] [Once Natsuhiko said that, Salyu quietly spoke up.]
 44:  729| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  732| [45] ["No... I think we should go see Dr. Tenkawa."]
 46:  784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  787| [45] ["Why Mom? She didn't listen to us yesterday, remember?"]
 48:  795| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  798| [45] ["There's a high possibility she won't take us seriously again."]
 50:  806| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  809| [45] ["I know."]
 52:  817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  820| [45] ["She's selfish. She doesn't listen to me... She never has."]
 54:  825| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  826| [45] ["..."]
 56:  834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  837| [45] ["So why Mom? I can't rely on her for--"]
 58:  845| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  848| [45] ["You should still believe in her, Natsuhiko."]
 60:  853| [45] [Salyu interrupted.]
 61:  858| [45] [She spoke in a tone that wouldn't take no for an answer.]
 62:  866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  869| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 64:  895| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  898| [45] ["The professor does worry about you, Natsuhiko. You just don't realize how much she does."]
 66:  924| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  927| [45] ["Have you forgotten? The reason I was given the duty to protect you was because of the professor's orders to begin with."]
 68:  935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  938| [45] ["!"]
 70:  943| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, that was true.]
 71:  948| [45] [He should've known that for days. Ever since Salyu had come to the house. And yet--]
 72:  956| [47] [Salyu]
 73:  959| [45] ["Judging by that point alone, the professor must deeply worry about your safety. Am I wrong?"]
 74:  967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  970| [45] ["B-but why would Mom do something like that...?"]
 76:  996| [47] [Salyu]
 77:  999| [45] ["I haven't heard the detailed circumstances myself."]
 78: 1025| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1028| [45] ["But this is what the professor told me right before I arrived at the Tenkawa residence:"]
 80: 1054| [47] [Salyu]
 81: 1057| [45] ["'Not even the strongest fortification can guarantee perfect safety. This town has several holes.'"]
 82: 1065| [47] [Salyu]
 83: 1068| [45] ["'As a Rank S Aptitude Communicator, Natsuhiko is at a higher risk of danger than other Communicators.'"]
 84: 1076| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1079| [45] ["'But I cannot stay with him at all times. So I want you to protect Natsuhiko for me, Yui.'"]
 86: 1087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1090| [45] ["Mom said that...?"]
 88: 1095| [45] [It was hard to believe at first-- but part of it sounded familiar.]
 89: 1100| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1101| [45] [(Then you mean... that's what that voice meant?)]
 91: 1106| [45] [The mental voice he had heard from his mother yesterday.]
 92: 1111| [45] ["I knew it. He hates me. But until all the work is complete, it'd be best if I avoided him..."]
 93: 1116| [45] [Natsuhiko was rendered speechless as Salyu continued.]
 94: 1142| [47] [Salyu]
 95: 1145| [45] ["... The professor said this too."]
 96: 1153| [47] [Salyu]
 97: 1156| [45] ["'Both Natsuhiko's mind and yours are lacking in some areas. But that's exactly why you can complete each other.'"]
 98: 1164| [47] [Salyu]
 99: 1167| [45] ["'I have high hopes for you, Yui. Hopes that you can give Natsuhiko what I cannot.'"]
100: 1175| [47] [Salyu]
101: 1178| [45] ["'Hopes that Natsuhiko can give you what I cannot.'"]
102: 1204| [47] [Salyu]
103: 1207| [45] ["... I didn't quite understand what she meant when she said that. But now I feel like I understand."]
104: 1215| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1218| [45] ["Ever since I met you and became friends with Mashiro, I've gained so many things."]
106: 1226| [47] [Salyu]
107: 1229| [45] ["The professor did not lie. So I believe in her."]
108: 1234| [45] [Natsuhiko gazed at Salyu.]
109: 1239| [45] [Her firm expression somewhat resembled his mother's.]
110: 1244| [45] [Mashiro quietly spoke up as well.]
111: 1288| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 1291| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, what Salyu's saying is true."]
113: 1299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1302| [45] ["Huh?"]
115: 1310| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1313| [45] ["You see, the professor's -always- thinking about you."]
117: 1339| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1342| [45] ["Besides, it was the professor who asked me to come by and make food for you, remember?"]
119: 1350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1353| [45] ["You're right, she was...!"]
121: 1361| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 1364| [45] ["The professor thought that you needed a 'family' to be with you in that empty house in her stead."]
123: 1390| [47] [Mashiro]
124: 1393| [45] ["Because if you and Yuuri were left along amongst yourselves, your emotional scars would only deepen."]
125: 1419| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 1422| [45] ["... I'm sure that was her intention behind arranging for Salyu to live in the Tenkawa residence as well."]
127: 1430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1433| [45] ["...!"]
129: 1438| [45] [Natsuhiko was taken aback.]
130: 1443| [45] [He realized that the three residents in the Tenkawa household-- Natsuhiko, Yuuri, and finally, Salyu-- all had one thing in common.]
131: 1448| [45] [And that was the lack of deep familial bonds. They knew not the warmth of a family.]
132: 1453| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1454| [45] [(... Is that what she meant by us completing each other...!?)]
134: 1459| [45] [The moment he came to that realization, all doubts in his mind melted away.]
135: 1464| [45] [Why his mother had taken custody of Yuuri. Why she brought Salyu to their home. Why she had ordered Salyu to protect him.]
136: 1469| [45] [It all tied back to that single intention his mother had.]
137: 1474| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1475| [45] [(...)]
139: 1480| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1481| [45] [(... Why, Mom?)]
141: 1486| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1487| [45] [(Why haven't you ever said a word about this...!?)]
143: 1537| [45] [As that question came to mind, Natsuhiko took a look at the watch wrapped around his wrist.]
144: 1542| [45] [It was a "Salvia" branded watch.]
145: 1547| [45] [It was a gift his mom had given him in the distant past.]
146: 1601| [45] [The memory of when he had received that watch rose up in Natsuhiko's heart.]
147: 1606| [45] [How many years ago was it?]
148: 1611| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1612| [45] [(That's right... It was when I was 5...)]
150: 1617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 1618| [45] [(Right after Dad died.)]
152: 1673| [45] [His mother was not as much of a workaholic back then.]
153: 1678| [45] [Even after her beloved husband had died from illness, she showed no tears to her son, but a soft smile instead.]
154: 1683| [45] [And once things had calmed down after the funeral, Natsuhiko's mother gently spoke to her son who had yet to stop crying.]
155: 1709| [47] [Miyoko]
156: 1712| [45] ["Natsuhiko, I'm giving you this watch."]
157: 1720| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1723| [45] ["Huh...? Watch?"]
159: 1731| [47] [Miyoko]
160: 1734| [45] ["It was your father's watch."]
161: 1742| [47] [Miyoko]
162: 1745| [45] ["I gave this watch to him when we were young, and he wore it every day until his last..."]
163: 1750| [45] [It was a memento of his father.]
164: 1755| [45] [The mother changed the strap and fastened it to her son's wrist.]
165: 1763| [47] [Miyoko]
166: 1766| [45] ["I also have a letter your father wrote for you..."]
167: 1771| [45] [And with that, she handed Natsuhiko a letter.]
168: 1776| [45] [The letter was written in simple hiragana so that Natsuhiko could read it at his age.]
169: 1814| [45] [Dearest Natsuhiko,]
170: 1817| [85] [ã€€]
171: 1820| [45] [I'm sorry for leaving you behind and dying while you're still so young.]
172: 1823| [45] [I'm sure you're sad. I'm so sorry.]
173: 1826| [45] [But you mustn't cry forever.]
174: 1829| [45] [I'm sure your mom will be sad if you cry.]
175: 1832| [45] [Your mom might look strong,%Nbut there are many more delicate things about her than you would expect.]
176: 1835| [45] [So please support her.]
177: 1839| [45] [You're a strong boy.]
178: 1842| [45] [You've inherited my sense of justice,%Nand you have a heart that won't lose to pain or sadness.]
179: 1845| [45] [And I'm proud of you for that.]
180: 1848| [45] [No matter how painful it gets, don't you cry.%NProtect those weaker than you.]
181: 1851| [45] [The more you protect people, the tougher things will get.%NYou'll get hurt a lot too.]
182: 1854| [45] [But I'll be up here in heaven, watching over you in return.]
183: 1857| [45] [So be strong.]
184: 1860| [85] [ã€€]
185: 1863| [45] [I love you, my son.]
186: 1866| [85] [             ]
187: 1867| [45] [Your father, Shun.]
188: 1893| [45] [The handwriting was terribly rough, perhaps because it was written when his father was in his sickbed.]
189: 1898| [45] [Seeing the disheveled letters made him want to cry again--]
190: 1903| [45] [But Natsuhiko desperately held in his tears.]
191: 1908| [45] [As he held tightly onto the letter with quivering hands, his mother gently embraced him.]
192: 1934| [47] [Miyoko]
193: 1937| [45] ["... Your father is always with you."]
194: 1963| [47] [Miyoko]
195: 1966| [45] ["And I am too. I always will be..."]
196: 1971| [45] [There were tears in her eyes as she said that.]
197: 1979| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 1982| [45] ["... Mom, why are you crying?"]
199: 1990| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 1993| [45] ["Even if Dad's gone, I'm here for you..."]
201: 2001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2004| [45] ["... So don't cry."]
203: 2048| [45] [The professor nodded and softly closed her eyes.]
204: 2053| [45] [The first tears he ever saw his mother cry quietly spilled down to the floor with a faint sound.]
205: 2141| [45] [--He had never seen his mother cry again until yesterday.]
206: 2146| [45] [Shortly after his father's death, his mother began working day and night as if to distract herself from the sadness. She came home less and less.]
207: 2151| [45] [His father told him to protect his mother, but Natsuhiko came to think that his mother was someone who could live on her own.]
208: 2156| [45] [Eventually, Natsuhiko put the letter away inside his desk and sealed the once-precious memory away inside his mind, seldom to be recalled again--]
209: 2162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
210: 2163| [45] [(... But that's why I've always used this watch, isn't it?)]
211: 2168| [45] [Natsuhiko always carried the symbol of the bond he had with his parents.]
212: 2173| [45] [Natsuhiko could feel the misgivings his heart held against his mother quietly begin to unravel.]
213: 2178| [45] [But obviously, even if he did see her soon, it wasn't as if they could return to a normal parent-child relationship that quickly.]
214: 2183| [45] [But even so--]
215: 2191| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2194| [45] ["... Let's go see Mom."]
217: 2199| [45] [Salyu and Mashiro silently nodded at the notion.]
218: 2204| [45] [Nobody in town was on their side. Not the city, nor the police, nor the school.]
219: 2209| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 2210| [45] [(But my mother, my own flesh and blood...)]
221: 2215| [45] [That thought was their last hope.]
222: 2223| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 2226| [45] ["As long as she's on our side, there's nobody more reassuring than Mom."]
224: 2252| [47] [Mashiro]
225: 2255| [45] ["True. After all, she's top brass at LABO, and a world class physicist, too."]
226: 2281| [47] [Salyu]
227: 2284| [45] ["Yes. Not even I can win against her."]
228: 2289| [45] [The three kids smiled at each other.]
229: 2294| [45] [That definite glimmer of hope was enough to raise their courage up a notch.]
230: 2320| [47] [Mashiro]
231: 2323| [45] ["... But how do we meet up with the professor?"]
232: 2331| [47] [Mashiro]
233: 2334| [45] ["They said they were strengthening security, so don't you think it would be hard to get inside the building?"]
234: 2342| [47] [Mashiro]
235: 2345| [45] ["According to the rumors, LABO's security guards are ex-JSDF soldiers equipped with rubber bullet machine guns."]
236: 2353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2356| [45] ["That reminds me. Mr. Ukita said that LABO had permission to possess security measures beyond the law, didn't he?"]
238: 2382| [47] [Salyu]
239: 2385| [45] ["Then do we infiltrate from a back entrance? Such a large facility has a high probability of having several entrances."]
240: 2390| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered that question for a while.]
241: 2398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 2401| [45] ["... No, let's go in directly from the front."]
243: 2427| [47] [Salyu]
244: 2430| [45] ["Huh?"]
245: 2438| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 2441| [45] ["If the sleeper agent is a security guard, then sneaking in would actually be more risky."]
247: 2449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 2452| [45] ["There's the danger they could bring us somewhere out of sight and finish us off there."]
249: 2460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 2463| [45] ["But if we walk in fair and square through the front door, we'll attract a lot of eyes. It'll make it difficult for the enemy to interfere with us that way."]
251: 2489| [47] [Salyu]
252: 2492| [45] ["But if the security guards aren't sleeper agents, then wouldn't it only be obvious that they'd apprehend us?"]
253: 2500| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 2503| [45] ["No problem. If we get them to take us to Mom, then that'll still fulfill our goal."]
255: 2529| [47] [Mashiro]
256: 2532| [45] ["... True... but isn't that still too much of a gamble?"]
257: 2540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
258: 2543| [45] ["Yeah. It's a gamble. But it's probably our safest bet... and the route most aligned with justice."]
259: 2551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
260: 2554| [45] ["What hero of justice sneaks in through the back door? A lame hero, that's what."]
261: 2559| [45] [Mashiro stared in blank amazement at Natsuhiko's broad grin.]
262: 2585| [47] [Mashiro]
263: 2588| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko, aren't you acting... a bit differently from how you usually do?"]
264: 2596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 2599| [45] ["What, have you forgotten, Mashiro? Well, guess I can't blame you since it's been nine whole years--"]
266: 2607| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 2610| [45] ["But this is how I used to be, isn't it?"]
268: 2615| [45] [Mashiro's face lit up like the sun at those words.]
269: 2659| [47] [Mashiro]
270: 2662| [45] ["... That's it, Natsuhiko! Those were the words I've been waiting for!"]
271: 2670| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 2673| [45] ["Okay, so no problems going through the front then, right guys!?"]
273: 2699| [47] [Salyu]
274: 2702| [45] ["That certainly does seem like the most rational idea."]
275: 2710| [47] [Mashiro]
276: 2713| [45] ["Yeah!"]
277: 2718| [45] [The three of them smiled at each other.]
278: 2723| [45] [And they gazed at the end of the long road.]
279: 2767| [45] [The Summer Triangle shone up high in the night sky as if to guide them--]
280: 2772| [45] [As if each of the three stars symbolized them--]
281: 2777| [47] [Natsuhiko]
282: 2778| [45] [(Yeah, this sort of thing happened before, didn't it...)]
283: 2783| [45] [Natsuhiko abruptly recalled an event from his past.]
284: 2788| [45] [--When he was young, Natsuhiko wanted to be a hero of justice.]
285: 2793| [45] [And in an attempt to get even the slightest bit closer to that goal, he ran all around town with complete disregard for danger.]
286: 2798| [45] [But because of his actions, Yuuri got hurt.]
287: 2803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
288: 2804| [45] [(That was when time stopped for me, wasn't it...)]
289: 2809| [45] [He had always thought that it didn't matter to him.]
290: 2814| [45] [If his frail sense of justice hurt others, then he was better off not doing anything.]
291: 2819| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 2820| [45] [(But... it's not like that now.)]
293: 2825| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 2826| [45] [(I swear I'll protect everyone and everything this time.)]
295: 2831| [45] [Natsuhiko walked with that conviction in his heart.]
296: 2890| [45] [Eventually, as the stars faded away to give rise to the light of day--]
297: 2895| [45] [They found their destination just a short distance away.]
