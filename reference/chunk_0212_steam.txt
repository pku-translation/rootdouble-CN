  1:  188| [47] [Ukita]
  2:  191| [45] ["Hmm... well, if it isn't Natsuhiko?"]
  3:  199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  202| [45] ["Huh... Ah!"]
  5:  207| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped and looked at the owner of the voice.]
  6:  212| [45] [A car was parked at the shoulder of the road-- and Ukita had come out of the driver's seat.]
  7:  286| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  289| [45] ["Mr. Ukita!"]
  9:  297| [47] [Ukita]
 10:  300| [45] ["Is something the matter? What's with all this commotion outside in a place like this?"]
 11:  305| [45] [Ukita questioned the kids with a curious look on his face.]
 12:  310| [45] [Suddenly, Natsuhiko remembered Mr. Ukita's accident.]
 13:  415| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  418| [45] ["I wonder how Mr. Ukita still got into an accident, though..."]
 15:  426| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  429| [45] ["Beats me. Maybe there was a system error in his car's ADS?"]
 17:  455| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  458| [45] ["But I thought ADS failures were exceptionally rare?"]
 19:  572| [45] [--He didn't think too deeply about the cause of the accident at the time, but...]
 20:  577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  578| [45] [(What if that wasn't an accident...?)]
 22:  583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  584| [45] [(What if Q targeted Mr. Ukita since he's with LABO!?)]
 24:  589| [45] [Terrified, Natsuhiko rushed up to Ukita.]
 25:  597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  600| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, please listen! You see--"]
 27:  623| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro explained Salyu's conjecture.]
 28:  628| [45] [Ukita probably didn't know who Salyu was, so they explained her story as well.]
 29:  633| [45] [And after he had finished hearing everything, Ukita spoke with a grim look on his face.]
 30:  659| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  662| [45] ["... Q's targeting us!? This is a huge concern!"]
 32:  670| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  673| [45] ["You know about Q too, Mr. Ukita?"]
 34:  699| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  702| [45] ["Computers are a hobby of mine. Naturally, that includes browsing the internet as well, which is how I happened to learn of them."]
 36:  728| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  731| [45] ["But never in my wildest dreams did I ever expect they'd target my own workplace when we've got nothing to do with them."]
 38:  736| [45] [His phrasing sounded a little cynical, but he appeared to have believed the kids' word.]
 39:  741| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed in relief as he continued the explanation.]
 40:  749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  752| [45] ["We just caught one of those terrorists."]
 42:  778| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  781| [45] ["You caught one!? Y-you kids did!?"]
 44:  807| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  810| [45] ["Yes. But he might have just been a diversion."]
 46:  836| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  839| [45] ["Hmm... In that case, we can't rest yet, can we?"]
 48:  865| [47] [Ukita]
 49:  868| [45] ["But we at LABO have the strictest security in the entire city. Terrorists couldn't target us even if they tried."]
 50:  876| [47] [Ukita]
 51:  879| [45] ["I highly doubt they can crush our security that easily."]
 52:  905| [47] [Salyu]
 53:  908| [45] ["But it wouldn't hurt to be alert."]
 54:  934| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  937| [45] ["Hmm... Indeed, it would be disastrous in the off chance that they did manage to take over the facility. So in that case..."]
 56:  963| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  966| [45] ["Okay! I'll talk to the security staff and get them to strengthen security even further!"]
 58: 1007| [47] [Mashiro]
 59: 1010| [45] ["Okay, please do!"]
 60: 1015| [45] [Mashiro and Ukita smiled at each other.]
 61: 1098| [45] [On the other hand, Natsuhiko secretly focused his mind.]
 62: 1103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1104| [45] [(Sorry, Mr. Ukita, it's not like I don't trust you, but...)]
 64: 1109| [45] [He decided to read Ukita's mind just to make sure, just like he did with Jun.]
 65: 1114| [45] [He searched for Ukita's brain waveform and identified him as Type 1.]
 66: 1119| [45] [He continued and focused on the desire to know what was on his mind.]
 67: 1124| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1125| [45] [(Please, Mr. Ukita, open your heart to me...!)]
 69: 1130| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, he heard a voice echo in his head.]
 70: 1418| [85] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
 71: 1419| [86] [Ukita]
 72: 1420| [86] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
 73: 1435| [85] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
 74: 1436| [86] [Ukita]
 75: 1437| [86] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
 76: 1468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1471| [45] ["--...gh."]
 78: 1476| [45] [Natsuhiko had gradually gotten used to it by his third attempt. He successfully used empathy.]
 79: 1481| [45] [And above all else, Ukita was thankfully opening his heart to them.]
 80: 1651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1654| [45] ["... Thank you, Mr. Ukita. I'm glad we consulted with you."]
 82: 1680| [47] [Ukita]
 83: 1683| [45] ["Hmm? No, no, I only did what was natural. I have an obligation to fulfill as a member of LABO."]
 84: 1709| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1712| [45] ["But no matter what happens... promise me you kids won't put yourselves in danger."]
 86: 1717| [45] [The kids felt that having him as an ally would be a big support.]
 87: 1722| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1723| [45] ["..."]
 89: 1728| [45] [Salyu obediently listened to Ukita's words.]
 90: 1754| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1757| [45] ["Okay then, I shall be heading back to LABO now. I apologize, but we'll have to part here."]
 92: 1765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1768| [45] ["Okay, please do!"]
 94: 1788| [47] [Alice]
 95: 1791| [45] ["Kyankyan!"]
 96: 1811| [45] [With Natsuhiko and Alice's voices at his back, Ukita returned to his car.]
 97: 1822| [45] [He then drove back towards LABO.]
 98: 1827| [45] [But as they watched the car drive off-- Salyu muttered quietly.]
 99: 1870| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1873| [45] ["... I don't understand what's on other people's minds."]
101: 1881| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1884| [45] ["Hmm...? What's this all of a sudden?"]
103: 1910| [47] [Salyu]
104: 1913| [45] ["Well, there's something I want to ask you two."]
105: 1921| [47] [Salyu]
106: 1924| [45] ["Did you notice anything suspicious about Keiji Ukita's speech and conduct?"]
107: 1950| [47] [Mashiro]
108: 1953| [45] ["Huh...? Suspicious?"]
109: 1958| [45] [An unpleasant premonition quickly spread among them.]
110: 1963| [45] [Salyu petted Alice and continued.]
111: 1989| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1992| [45] ["When I said anything suspicious, I was referring to the reason Alice cried out like that."]
113: 2000| [47] [Salyu]
114: 2003| [45] ["That 'kyankyan!' cry indicates when someone's flustered."]
115: 2029| [47] [Salyu]
116: 2032| [45] ["... Why would he be flustered?"]
117: 2040| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 2043| [45] ["!?"]
119: 2048| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro gasped at that word.]
120: 2074| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 2077| [45] ["... Wait, what do you mean by flustered...?"]
122: 2085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 2088| [45] ["He didn't look that way to me."]
124: 2114| [47] [Salyu]
125: 2117| [45] ["Alice can detect nuanced changes in facial expression that may be difficult for humans to detect."]
126: 2125| [47] [Salyu]
127: 2128| [45] ["Subtle indicators such as sweat, muscle tension, and shivering..."]
128: 2154| [47] [Salyu]
129: 2157| [45] ["If her analysis is correct, then he was flustered. But I do not understand the reason why."]
130: 2162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2163| [45] [(No way... Huh...?)]
132: 2168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2169| [45] [(Wh-which is it? Is Mr. Ukita a "victim" or an "aggressor"?)]
134: 2174| [45] [As he pondered, Natsuhiko suddenly realized something.]
135: 2179| [45] [There was something bizarre about what he had heard of Ukita's mental voice.]
136: 2409| [85] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
137: 2410| [86] [Ukita]
138: 2411| [86] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
139: 2426| [85] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
140: 2427| [86] [Ukita]
141: 2428| [86] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
142: 2545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2548| [45] ["'There's no time'...!?"]
144: 2553| [45] [Natsuhiko had been quite relieved to find out that Ukita's heart was open, but--]
145: 2558| [45] [The more he thought about it, the stranger it seemed.]
146: 2563| [45] [Why would Ukita think "there's no time" just from hearing Salyu's conjecture?]
147: 2568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2569| [45] [(H-hold on a second...!)]
149: 2574| [45] [That wasn't all that was strange.]
150: 2579| [45] ["I can't get these kids involved too" could be taken in a way that meant he had already gotten other people involved.]
151: 2587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2590| [45] ["Th... there's two possibilities."]
153: 2598| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2601| [45] ["Either Mr. Ukita really felt the gravity of the terrorist threat--"]
155: 2627| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 2630| [45] ["Or Mr. Ukita is with the terrorists... and thought that we had caught onto the plan...?"]
157: 2642| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart pounded.]
158: 2647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2648| [45] [(Q uses "sleeper agents"...!)]
160: 2653| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 2654| [45] [(Is Mr. Ukita the sleeper agent in their LABO terrorist plot...!?)]
162: 2662| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2665| [45] ["... Oh crap! Let's chase after Mr. Ukita for now!"]
164: 2691| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 2694| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
166: 2748| [45] [There was no time for Natsuhiko to dwell on unpleasant memories.]
167: 2753| [45] [The kids ran off in the direction they had seen Ukita leave.]
