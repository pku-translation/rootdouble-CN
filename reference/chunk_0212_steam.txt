  1:  110| [47] [Ukita]
  2:  113| [45] ["Hmm... well, if it isn't Natsuhiko?"]
  3:  121| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  124| [45] ["Huh... Ah!"]
  5:  129| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped and looked at the owner of the voice.]
  6:  134| [45] [A car was parked at the shoulder of the road-- and Ukita had come out of the driver's seat.]
  7:  208| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  211| [45] ["Mr. Ukita!"]
  9:  219| [47] [Ukita]
 10:  222| [45] ["Is something the matter? What's with all this commotion outside in a place like this?"]
 11:  227| [45] [Ukita questioned the kids with a curious look on his face.]
 12:  232| [45] [Suddenly, Natsuhiko remembered Mr. Ukita's accident.]
 13:  337| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  340| [45] ["I wonder how Mr. Ukita still got into an accident, though..."]
 15:  348| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  351| [45] ["Beats me. Maybe there was a system error in his car's ADS?"]
 17:  377| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  380| [45] ["But I thought ADS failures were exceptionally rare?"]
 19:  494| [45] [--He didn't think too deeply about the cause of the accident at the time, but...]
 20:  499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  500| [45] [(What if that wasn't an accident...?)]
 22:  505| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  506| [45] [(What if Q targeted Mr. Ukita since he's with LABO!?)]
 24:  511| [45] [Terrified, Natsuhiko rushed up to Ukita.]
 25:  519| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  522| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, please listen! You see--"]
 27:  545| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro explained Salyu's conjecture.]
 28:  550| [45] [Ukita probably didn't know who Salyu was, so they explained her story as well.]
 29:  555| [45] [And after he had finished hearing everything, Ukita spoke with a grim look on his face.]
 30:  581| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  584| [45] ["... Q's targeting us!? This is a huge concern!"]
 32:  592| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  595| [45] ["You know about Q too, Mr. Ukita?"]
 34:  621| [47] [Ukita]
 35:  624| [45] ["Computers are a hobby of mine. Naturally, that includes browsing the internet as well, which is how I happened to learn of them."]
 36:  650| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  653| [45] ["But never in my wildest dreams did I ever expect they'd target my own workplace when we've got nothing to do with them."]
 38:  658| [45] [His phrasing sounded a little cynical, but he appeared to have believed the kids' word.]
 39:  663| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed in relief as he continued the explanation.]
 40:  671| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  674| [45] ["We just caught one of those terrorists."]
 42:  700| [47] [Ukita]
 43:  703| [45] ["You caught one!? Y-you kids did!?"]
 44:  729| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  732| [45] ["Yes. But he might have just been a diversion."]
 46:  758| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  761| [45] ["Hmm... In that case, we can't rest yet, can we?"]
 48:  787| [47] [Ukita]
 49:  790| [45] ["But we at LABO have the strictest security in the entire city. Terrorists couldn't target us even if they tried."]
 50:  798| [47] [Ukita]
 51:  801| [45] ["I highly doubt they can crush our security that easily."]
 52:  827| [47] [Salyu]
 53:  830| [45] ["But it wouldn't hurt to be alert."]
 54:  856| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  859| [45] ["Hmm... Indeed, it would be disastrous in the off chance that they did manage to take over the facility. So in that case..."]
 56:  885| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  888| [45] ["Okay! I'll talk to the security staff and get them to strengthen security even further!"]
 58:  929| [47] [Mashiro]
 59:  932| [45] ["Okay, please do!"]
 60:  937| [45] [Mashiro and Ukita smiled at each other.]
 61: 1020| [45] [On the other hand, Natsuhiko secretly focused his mind.]
 62: 1025| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1026| [45] [(Sorry, Mr. Ukita, it's not like I don't trust you, but...)]
 64: 1031| [45] [He decided to read Ukita's mind just to make sure, just like he did with Jun.]
 65: 1036| [45] [He searched for Ukita's brain waveform and identified him as Type 1.]
 66: 1041| [45] [He continued and focused on the desire to know what was on his mind.]
 67: 1046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1047| [45] [(Please, Mr. Ukita, open your heart to me...!)]
 69: 1052| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, he heard a voice echo in his head.]
 70: 1340| [85] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
 71: 1341| [86] [Ukita]
 72: 1342| [86] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
 73: 1357| [85] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
 74: 1358| [86] [Ukita]
 75: 1359| [86] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
 76: 1390| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1393| [45] ["--...gh."]
 78: 1398| [45] [Natsuhiko had gradually gotten used to it by his third attempt. He successfully used empathy.]
 79: 1403| [45] [And above all else, Ukita was thankfully opening his heart to them.]
 80: 1573| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1576| [45] ["... Thank you, Mr. Ukita. I'm glad we consulted with you."]
 82: 1602| [47] [Ukita]
 83: 1605| [45] ["Hmm? No, no, I only did what was natural. I have an obligation to fulfill as a member of LABO."]
 84: 1631| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1634| [45] ["But no matter what happens... promise me you kids won't put yourselves in danger."]
 86: 1639| [45] [The kids felt that having him as an ally would be a big support.]
 87: 1644| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1645| [45] ["..."]
 89: 1650| [45] [Salyu obediently listened to Ukita's words.]
 90: 1676| [47] [Ukita]
 91: 1679| [45] ["Okay then, I shall be heading back to LABO now. I apologize, but we'll have to part here."]
 92: 1687| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1690| [45] ["Okay, please do!"]
 94: 1710| [47] [Alice]
 95: 1713| [45] ["Kyankyan!"]
 96: 1733| [45] [With Natsuhiko and Alice's voices at his back, Ukita returned to his car.]
 97: 1744| [45] [He then drove back towards LABO.]
 98: 1749| [45] [But as they watched the car drive off-- Salyu muttered quietly.]
 99: 1792| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1795| [45] ["... I don't understand what's on other people's minds."]
101: 1803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1806| [45] ["Hmm...? What's this all of a sudden?"]
103: 1832| [47] [Salyu]
104: 1835| [45] ["Well, there's something I want to ask you two."]
105: 1843| [47] [Salyu]
106: 1846| [45] ["Did you notice anything suspicious about Keiji Ukita's speech and conduct?"]
107: 1872| [47] [Mashiro]
108: 1875| [45] ["Huh...? Suspicious?"]
109: 1880| [45] [An unpleasant premonition quickly spread among them.]
110: 1885| [45] [Salyu petted Alice and continued.]
111: 1911| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1914| [45] ["When I said anything suspicious, I was referring to the reason Alice cried out like that."]
113: 1922| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1925| [45] ["That 'kyankyan!' cry indicates when someone's flustered."]
115: 1951| [47] [Salyu]
116: 1954| [45] ["... Why would he be flustered?"]
117: 1962| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1965| [45] ["!?"]
119: 1970| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro gasped at that word.]
120: 1996| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1999| [45] ["... Wait, what do you mean by flustered...?"]
122: 2007| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 2010| [45] ["He didn't look that way to me."]
124: 2036| [47] [Salyu]
125: 2039| [45] ["Alice can detect nuanced changes in facial expression that may be difficult for humans to detect."]
126: 2047| [47] [Salyu]
127: 2050| [45] ["Subtle indicators such as sweat, muscle tension, and shivering..."]
128: 2076| [47] [Salyu]
129: 2079| [45] ["If her analysis is correct, then he was flustered. But I do not understand the reason why."]
130: 2084| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2085| [45] [(No way... Huh...?)]
132: 2090| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2091| [45] [(Wh-which is it? Is Mr. Ukita a "victim" or an "aggressor"?)]
134: 2096| [45] [As he pondered, Natsuhiko suddenly realized something.]
135: 2101| [45] [There was something bizarre about what he had heard of Ukita's mental voice.]
136: 2331| [85] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
137: 2332| [86] [Ukita]
138: 2333| [86] [{I can't get these kids involved too...}]
139: 2348| [85] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
140: 2349| [86] [Ukita]
141: 2350| [86] [{But there's no time. Need to act now!}]
142: 2467| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2470| [45] ["'There's no time'...!?"]
144: 2475| [45] [Natsuhiko had been quite relieved to find out that Ukita's heart was open, but--]
145: 2480| [45] [The more he thought about it, the stranger it seemed.]
146: 2485| [45] [Why would Ukita think "there's no time" just from hearing Salyu's conjecture?]
147: 2490| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2491| [45] [(H-hold on a second...!)]
149: 2496| [45] [That wasn't all that was strange.]
150: 2501| [45] ["I can't get these kids involved too" could be taken in a way that meant he had already gotten other people involved.]
151: 2509| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2512| [45] ["Th... there's two possibilities."]
153: 2520| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2523| [45] ["Either Mr. Ukita really felt the gravity of the terrorist threat--"]
155: 2549| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 2552| [45] ["Or Mr. Ukita is with the terrorists... and thought that we had caught onto the plan...?"]
157: 2564| [45] [Natsuhiko's heart pounded.]
158: 2569| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2570| [45] [(Q uses "sleeper agents"...!)]
160: 2575| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 2576| [45] [(Is Mr. Ukita the sleeper agent in their LABO terrorist plot...!?)]
162: 2584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2587| [45] ["... Oh crap! Let's chase after Mr. Ukita for now!"]
164: 2613| [47] [Mashiro]
165: 2616| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
166: 2670| [45] [There was no time for Natsuhiko to dwell on unpleasant memories.]
167: 2675| [45] [The kids ran off in the direction they had seen Ukita leave.]
