  1:  326| [86] [Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?]
  2:  327| [86] ["My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."]
  3:  328| [86] [(The New Testament / Mark 5:9)]
  4:  339| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  342| [45] ["Haah... haah... haah..."]
  6:  347| [45] [--The blood poured endlessly.]
  7:  352| [45] [From his side. His left arm. His right leg.]
  8:  522| [45] [Natsuhiko kept running, even though he was under the whitewashed tomb.]
  9:  527| [45] [He ran to get away from that man-- and to defeat him.]
 10:  543| [45] [And at the end of his flight, Natsuhiko's feet brought him--]
 11:  726| [45] [--to a vast hall where six spires towered above him.]
 12:  812| [45] [And then a gunshot shrieked from behind.]
 13:  898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  901| [45] ["Gah...!"]
 15:  912| [45] [Natsuhiko fell, pain burning through his left arm.]
 16:  969| [45] [Blood puddled on the floor as darkness and helplessness descended upon him.]
 17: 1018| [47] [Watase]
 18: 1021| [45] ["--So this is where you die?"]
 19: 1026| [45] [Natsuhiko didn't even have the energy to respond.]
 20: 1031| [45] [Eventually, the man parted with these words:]
 21: 1057| [47] [Watase]
 22: 1060| [45] ["... After you comes the girl."]
 23: 1161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24: 1162| [45] [(--!?)]
 25: 1191| [45] [Natsuhiko stood up with all his might to put an end to the man's wicked deeds.]
 26: 1247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27: 1250| [45] ["Waaaaggghhh!"]
 28: 1458| [47] [Watase]
 29: 1461| [45] ["!?"]
 30: 1568| [45] [There was but one thing Natsuhiko needed to do: use his ability to destroy the man's mind.]
 31: 1573| [45] [So he focused with all his mind. All his spirit.]
 32: 1683| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33: 1686| [45] ["----!!"]
 34: 1913| [47] [Watase]
 35: 1916| [45] ["Agh, GAAAAAAAH!!"]
 36: 1997| [45] [The man dropped his gun and screamed.]
 37: 2002| [45] [His face rapidly froze over--]
 38: 2028| [47] [Watase]
 39: 2031| [45] ["Aah... aah..."]
 40: 2057| [47] [Watase]
 41: 2060| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
 42: 2080| [45] [--And he ran for his life.]
 43: 2141| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44: 2144| [45] ["Wait! ... Guh!"]
 45: 2149| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to pursue the man, but staggered,]
 46: 2212| [45] [slammed his back against a tower, and collapsed on the spot.]
 47: 2217| [45] [Blood streamed out from his entire body. He could feel his mortal flame fading.]
 48: 2222| [45] [But to protect his beloved hometown and the people precious to him who lived within--]
 49: 2321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50: 2322| [45] [(So please... work...)]
 51: 2441| [85] [{Shatter!!}]
 52: 2442| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 53: 2443| [86] [{Shatter!!}]
 54: 2477| [45] [--He mustered the last of his strength to destroy every last memory that composed the man's mind.]
 55: 2530| [47] [Watase]
 56: 2533| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
 57: 2546| [45] [And as the man fell, Natsuhiko's consciousness rapidly faded away--]
 58: 2600| [45] [------]
 59: 2605| [45] [----]
 60: 2610| [45] [--]
 61: 2729| [45] [--Eventually, far past that frozen time--]
 62: 2734| [45] ["Awake", a voice called to him.]
 63: 2739| [45] [Or perhaps it was merely a memory of such a voice.]
 64: 2744| [45] [He heard that voice as he lay beneath the whitewashed tomb...]
 65: 2749| [45] [And then time began to move.]
