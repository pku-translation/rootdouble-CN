  1:   22| [45] [Watase hurried into a nearby restroom once he'd left the reference room.]
  2:  174| [45] [He turned the sink faucet on with all his might and washed his face with cold water.]
  3:  180| [45] [But his headache didn't get any better at all.]
  4:  185| [47] [Watase]
  5:  186| [45] [(Not another headache... Wait, could this be an effect of radiation damage...!?)]
  6:  191| [45] [It was at that moment that he remembered something Kazami and the others had told him.]
  7:  196| [45] ["There's a possibility the tap water's been contaminated by radiation. You could get internal radiation exposure just from drinking it."]
  8:  201| [47] [Watase]
  9:  202| [45] [(Shit...!)]
 10:  207| [45] [He'd been washing his face with that stuff.]
 11:  212| [45] [Watase frantically wiped his face to make sure none of the water got in his mouth or nose.]
 12:  217| [45] [But his headache still hurt just as much as it had before, and soon he was assaulted with anxiety and fear that made him feel even worse.]
 13:  269| [47] [Watase]
 14:  272| [45] ["Ghh... urgh!"]
 15:  277| [45] [Watase vomited into the sink.]
 16:  286| [45] [His stomach was empty, so all that came out were gastric juices.]
 17:  291| [45] [A heavy sense of fatigue weighed down his whole body.]
 18:  296| [47] [Watase]
 19:  297| [45] [(Dammit... I'm thinking about way too much at once...!)]
 20:  302| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth.]
 21:  307| [45] [Being trapped in this hellish environment was bad enough, but now strange incidents were happening one after another, people had either died or been killed, and on top of that--]
 22:  312| [47] [Watase]
 23:  313| [45] [(There might be monsters out there who can read people's minds...!)]
 24:  318| [45] [Watase was extremely confused.]
 25:  323| [45] [At that moment-- countless disconnected images flashed through his mind as if they were conspiring with that confusion.]
 26:  414| [86] [Yuuri]
 27:  415| [86] ["Who... who are you?"]
 28:  425| [85] ["Who... who are you?"]
 29:  488| [86] [???]
 30:  489| [86] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 31:  497| [85] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 32:  560| [86] [???]
 33:  561| [86] ["How do you know our names...!?"]
 34:  569| [85] ["How do you know our names...!?"]
 35:  632| [86] [???]
 36:  633| [86] ["Because a whole lot of Communicators... people who can use BC, that is... have been coming to this city."]
 37:  641| [85] ["Because a whole lot of Communicators... people who can use BC, that is... have been coming to this city."]
 38:  737| [47] [Watase]
 39:  738| [45] [(--...!?)]
 40:  743| [47] [Watase]
 41:  744| [45] [(Wh-what was all that!?)]
 42:  749| [45] [It felt like there had been images he didn't recognize mixed in with that one of Yuuri.]
 43:  754| [45] [And that Natsuhiko Tenkawa and his friends-- the very same people they were looking for now-- had been in them.]
 44:  759| [47] [Watase]
 45:  760| [45] [(Why...!? Have I seen them somewhere before...?)]
 46:  765| [45] [He didn't know. He couldn't tell if they were his own memories or not.]
 47:  770| [45] [But as Watase was driven to the brink of confusion by those mysterious images--]
 48:  827| [85] [{That's enough, Watase Kasasagi... don't think too deeply about it...!}]
 49:  828| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 50:  829| [86] [{That's enough, Watase Kasasagi... don't think too deeply about it...!}]
 51:  860| [47] [Watase]
 52:  863| [45] ["!?"]
 53:  868| [45] [--It was the first time in ages that he'd heard that auditory hallucination.]
 54:  873| [45] [Watase was overcome with astonishment when he heard it.]
 55:  878| [47] [Watase]
 56:  879| [45] [(Wait... could this auditory hallucination be trying to control me...!?)]
 57:  884| [45] [That suspicion expanded to immense proportions in one quick moment.]
 58:  889| [47] [Watase]
 59:  890| [45] [(No, what if--)]
 60:  895| [47] [Watase]
 61:  896| [45] [(What if someone's been controlling me this whole time...!?)]
 62:  901| [47] [Watase]
 63:  902| [45] [(Then who is the "me" that I've thought was me up until now...!?)]
 64:  907| [45] [Watase looked at his face in the mirror as he was seized by that primitive fear.]
 65:  912| [45] [Reflected in there was the face of an unfamiliar man he didn't recall.]
 66:  917| [45] [Watase felt whatever had been keeping himself sane up until this point start to fall apart in an instant.]
 67:  922| [45] [Kazami, Jun, Ena, and Ukita-- adults who possibly held some sort of malice against the survivors.]
 68:  927| [45] [Yuuri, Salyu, Natsuhiko, and Mashiro-- children who possibly wielded a mysterious power.]
 69:  932| [45] [And "himself", a man with vague memories and a will that might not even be his own--]
 70:  940| [47] [Watase]
 71:  943| [45] ["D-dammit...!"]
 72:  951| [47] [Watase]
 73:  954| [45] ["What... or who should I believe in...!?"]
 74:  959| [45] [Just as Watase started harboring doubts towards everyone, himself included--]
 75: 1024| [47] [???]
 76: 1027| [45] ["You're overthinking things, Watase."]
 77: 1035| [47] [???]
 78: 1038| [45] ["Do that and you'll just wuss out to the point where you won't be able to make sense of anything anymore."]
 79: 1094| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1097| [45] ["...!?"]
 81: 1102| [45] [Watase blinked. It felt like someone else's face was in the mirror.]
 82: 1107| [45] [But all he saw there was his own face.]
 83: 1112| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1113| [45] [(... What was that?)]
 85: 1118| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1119| [45] [(-Who- was that...?)]
 87: 1124| [45] [Perhaps it was a type of audiovisual hallucination, or maybe a flashback.]
 88: 1129| [45] [He wasn't sure, but when he saw that face--]
 89: 1134| [45] [He'd felt a mysterious sense of nostalgia come over him.]
 90: 1181| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1184| [45] ["Don't overthink things, huh..."]
 92: 1195| [45] [His heart calmed for some reason when he muttered that.]
 93: 1200| [45] [Watase felt as though that illusion had been admonishing him.]
 94: 1205| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1206| [45] [(That's right... I have to trust everyone... and myself...!)]
 96: 1218| [45] [Watase turned off the still running faucet.]
 97: 1223| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1224| [45] [(Looks like I was just jumping at shadows for a minute there...)]
 99: 1229| [45] [Watase finally realized that he'd regained his composure.]
100: 1272| [45] [And that his headache was now gone.]
101: 1277| [45] [By the time he left the bathroom, the doubts that had taken hold of him had completely vanished.]
