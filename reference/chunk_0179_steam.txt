  1:   68| [45] [--Natsuhiko peacefully awoke from his sleep that day.]
  2:  113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  114| [45] ["..."]
  4:  119| [45] [Although this morning wasn't particularly unpleasant, he still felt somehow depressed.]
  5:  128| [45] [The sound of rain could be heard from outside the window.]
  6:  133| [45] [It had temporarily let up last night, but appeared to have started pouring down once more.]
  7:  305| [45] [Natsuhiko headed to the living room to see only Yuuri and nobody else.]
  8:  310| [45] [Salyu was probably still sleeping.]
  9:  318| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  321| [45] ["Where's Mashiro?"]
 11:  329| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  332| [45] ["... She hasn't come."]
 13:  340| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  343| [45] ["Thought so..."]
 15:  348| [45] [Mashiro would often not come to the house the day after a fight.]
 16:  353| [45] [Yuuri glared at Natsuhiko judgmentally.]
 17:  379| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  382| [45] ["Mmgh...!"]
 19:  390| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  393| [45] ["Don't glare at me like that... If anything, last night was Mashiro's fault."]
 21:  401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  404| [45] ["She suddenly said something absurd and then got mad because I wouldn't believe her."]
 23:  430| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  433| [45] ["... You still should've believed in her then."]
 25:  441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  444| [45] ["No way... That's crazy talk."]
 27:  449| [45] [Natsuhiko was a little dejected that even Yuuri was criticizing him.]
 28:  457| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  460| [45] ["Say, Yuuri, I'm sure even you understand how seriously this city takes its public order, right? There's no way a terrorist plot could unravel here, could it?"]
 30:  468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  471| [45] ["Even if it did, what could we do? Fight the terrorists empty-handed?"]
 32:  479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  482| [45] ["This isn't some Hollywood blockbuster, you know."]
 34:  508| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  511| [45] ["True, but..."]
 36:  583| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  586| [45] ["But Hikorin, you might regret not doing anything."]
 38:  594| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  597| [45] ["Regret not doing anything? Why?"]
 40:  623| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  626| [45] ["I just get that sort of feeling..."]
 42:  631| [45] [Yuuri said no more.]
 43:  636| [45] [The rain outside sounded somehow softer than silence.]
 44:  653| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  656| [45] ["... Well, anyway, don't worry about Mashiro. I'll make sure to follow up on her."]
 46:  682| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  685| [45] ["Yeah. That would be best."]
 48:  690| [45] [Once Natsuhiko gave into the pressure and said that, Yuuri smiled with her whole face.]
 49:  695| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  696| [45] [(... But still, what should I actually do?)]
 51:  701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  702| [45] [(Is there something I can do that both Mashiro and Yuuri would agree with...?)]
 53:  710| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  711| [45] [(I mean, I can't just make a promise I don't intend to keep...)]
 55:  716| [45] [That's what Natsuhiko was thinking.]
 56:  721| [45] [The incident nine years ago was something he just couldn't forget.]
 57:  726| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  727| [45] [(Prevent terrorism ourselves? That's nothing but a pipe dream...)]
 59:  732| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind-- Salyu showed up in the living room.]
 60:  800| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  803| [45] ["You awake, Natsuhiko?"]
 62:  811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  814| [45] ["Just got up. You, Salyu?"]
 64:  840| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  843| [45] ["Me too. ... I overslept a little."]
 66:  895| [45] [Salyu looked around the room and continued.]
 67:  921| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  924| [45] ["Where's Mashiro?"]
 69:  932| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  935| [45] ["She's not here today."]
 71:  961| [47] [Salyu]
 72:  964| [45] ["Why not?"]
 73:  972| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74:  975| [45] ["Try and take a guess..."]
 75: 1001| [47] [Salyu]
 76: 1004| [45] ["...?"]
 77: 1009| [45] [Salyu tilted her head in confusion.]
 78: 1017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1020| [45] ["Well, I think she'll come tomorrow."]
 80: 1028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1031| [45] ["She'll be all like 'see how much you need little ol' me now?' and stuff."]
 82: 1057| [47] [Salyu]
 83: 1060| [45] ["I already do. No Mashiro means no food."]
 84: 1068| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1071| [45] ["Yeah. Sorry, but we'll have to settle for a meager breakfast today."]
 86: 1143| [45] [And with that, Natsuhiko tossed some bread into the toaster.]
 87: 1148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1149| [45] [(But still, it's been one thing or another every morning lately, huh...)]
 89: 1154| [45] [It wasn't like this at all just a few days ago.]
 90: 1159| [45] [But today's event-- Mashiro's absence-- was particularly rough on Natsuhiko's heart.]
 91: 1164| [45] [He honestly believed that his daily routine would continue forever, and yet--]
 92: 1169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1170| [45] [(... Would it really?)]
 94: 1175| [45] [--and yet now that question rose up inside his heart.]
 95: 1180| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1181| [45] [(One day, my peace could end. One day, I could lose those close to me. One day, my precious memories could crumble--)]
 97: 1186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1187| [45] [(Each of those things is clearly possible. So have I just been averting my eyes from the inevitable...?)]
 99: 1192| [45] [It was a question he had put little thought to, but it nonetheless tore at his heart.]
100: 1197| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1198| [45] [(... Wait, why am I even worrying about this?)]
102: 1203| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head as if to clear it of unnecessary thoughts.]
103: 1237| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1238| [45] ["..."]
105: 1243| [45] [Yuuri just watched him silently.]
