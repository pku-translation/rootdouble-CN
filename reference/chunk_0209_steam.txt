  0:   45| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 6]
  1:   67| [45] [--And soon enough, the taxi stopped.]
  2:   72| [45] [The kids were shocked to see what lay before them as they got down.]
  3:  118| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  121| [45] ["Here!?"]
  5:  126| [45] [It was the PRC, the same institution that they had known to be a Q target since yesterday.]
  6:  131| [45] [An explosion probably happened here. There were shards of glass everywhere. The building was wrecked.]
  7:  136| [45] [Jun's team was apparently already inside fighting fires and saving lives.]
  8:  184| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  187| [45] ["So this place really was being targeted...!"]
 10:  213| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  216| [45] ["The terrorists have finally sprung into action!"]
 12:  221| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and looked around.]
 13:  226| [45] [There were onlookers gathered around the building.]
 14:  231| [45] [The crowd of course included staff members who escaped the building as well as policemen and security department people, but--]
 15:  296| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  299| [45] ["The culprit could be in the crowd...!"]
 17:  307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  310| [45] ["Yeah, the culprit always appears at the scene of the crime, they say."]
 19:  315| [45] [They weren't quite sure of the authenticity of that saying, but that was all they could rely on for now.]
 20:  320| [45] [But it was quite a difficult task to find the culprit since they had no leads.]
 21:  328| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  331| [45] ["Mashiro. Can you search the crowd for the man you saw on the bus two days ago?"]
 23:  357| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  360| [45] ["Hmm~... In a crowd this big, it's obviously going to be hard. He might not be wearing the same sunglasses, after all."]
 25:  386| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  389| [45] ["... But maybe we can find him with unconventional methods?"]
 27:  397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  400| [45] ["Hmm? Like what?"]
 29:  444| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  447| [45] ["Let's just there's more than one way to use telepathy."]
 31:  452| [45] [Mashiro gave a bold smile as she placed a finger at her temple.]
 32:  478| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  481| [45] ["The culprit hates Communicators... so let's exploit that hatred."]
 34:  489| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  492| [45] ["I'll send 'untargeted' telepathy to all the onlookers. You guys watch for anyone whose reaction looks suspicious."]
 36:  500| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  503| [45] ["G-got it!"]
 38:  529| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  532| [45] ["Roger."]
 40:  558| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  561| [45] ["I apologize for the language in advance, so don't be surprised, okay...? Well, here goes!"]
 42:  614| [45] [And with that, Mashiro closed her eyes--]
 43:  672| [85] [{Hey, you dumbass bomber! You think you got away, stupid?}]
 44:  673| [86] [Mashiro]
 45:  674| [86] [{Hey, you dumbass bomber! You think you got away, stupid?}]
 46:  692| [85] [{You hate Communicators, huh?]
 47:  694| [85] [So why the hell are you watching the fire when one's right behind you!?}]
 48:  695| [86] [Mashiro]
 49:  696| [86] [{You hate Communicators, huh? So why the hell are you watching the fire when one's right behind you!?}]
 50:  730| [45] [The head-splitting telepathy echoed inside their heads.]
 51:  735| [45] [And at the same time, all the onlookers cowered in fear.]
 52:  765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  766| [45] [(Do anyone's reactions look off!?)]
 54:  771| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu darted their eyes around the crowd.]
 55:  776| [45] [People were bewildered. People were looking around. There were various reactions, but--]
 56:  827| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  828| [45] [(!!)]
 58:  833| [45] [But just one person's reaction stood out as different--]
 59:  838| [45] [--The same time Mashiro's telepathy rang out, a man turned and looked behind his shoulder in shock.]
 60:  843| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  844| [45] [(Huh...!?)]
 62:  849| [45] [That man looked familiar to Natsuhiko.]
 63:  854| [45] [His stern face, huge body, and finally his uniform--]
 64:  904| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  907| [45] ["Mashiro, Salyu, it's him!"]
 66:  912| [45] [The girls followed the path of Natsuhiko's finger and their faces stiffened.]
 67:  953| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  956| [45] ["!?"]
 69:  964| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  967| [45] ["That's...!"]
 71: 1039| [45] [--The very same security guard they ran into when they trespassed into the PRC yesterday.]
 72: 1044| [45] [The words they had heard from Ena earlier that day came to mind.]
 73: 1123| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1126| [45] ["Oftentimes they choose staff members with connections to the target buildings to be the perpetrators."]
 75: 1134| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1137| [45] ["The use of such sleeper agents increases the success rate of their terrorist acts."]
 77: 1243| [45] [A sleeper agent-- that was exactly the answer to the question that had been bugging Natsuhiko since yesterday.]
 78: 1248| [45] [The answer to why the security guard overreacted to what they said back then, too.]
 79: 1253| [45] [The answer to why he had filed a false report to the security department.]
 80: 1258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1259| [45] [(It's because -he's- the culprit behind everything!)]
 82: 1264| [45] [The moment he made that realization, he heard the onlookers start a commotion.]
 83: 1269| [47] [Onlooker 1]
 84: 1272| [45] ["What was that telepathy just now...?"]
 85: 1277| [47] [Onlooker 2]
 86: 1280| [45] ["Yeah, she said something about a bomber..."]
 87: 1285| [45] [That's when Mashiro sent in more telepathy.]
 88: 1363| [85] [{Officers! Security department people!]
 89: 1365| [85] [The bomber's that guy who looks like a security guard!}]
 90: 1366| [86] [Mashiro]
 91: 1367| [86] [{Officers! Security department people! The bomber's that guy who looks like a security guard!}]
 92: 1382| [85] [{He's super duper dangerous,]
 93: 1384| [85] [so all you onlookers need to be careful, okay!}]
 94: 1385| [86] [Mashiro]
 95: 1386| [86] [{He's super duper dangerous, so all you onlookers need to be careful, okay!}]
 96: 1420| [45] [The commotion grew even louder.]
 97: 1425| [45] [The security guard in question became quite uncomfortable and tried to slip his way out of the crowd of onlookers.]
 98: 1433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1436| [45] ["Salyu..."]
100: 1462| [47] [Salyu]
101: 1465| [45] ["I know. It's my turn now."]
102: 1479| [45] [And with that, Salyu slipped into the crowd and chased after the security guard.]
103: 1487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1490| [45] ["Mashiro, it's dangerous, so stay back!"]
105: 1495| [45] [Natsuhiko warned Mashiro as he chased after Salyu.]
106: 1568| [45] [And once the security guard slipped out of the crowd--]
107: 1617| [47] [Salyu]
108: 1620| [45] ["Hmmph!"]
109: 1676| [45] [Salyu let out a battle cry and lunged at him, dragging him into an alley.]
110: 1753| [47] [Security Guard]
111: 1756| [45] ["Y-you brats are... gwah!"]
112: 1761| [45] [Salyu side kicked the security guard in the knee before he could finish talking.]
113: 1881| [47] [Security Guard]
114: 1884| [45] ["D-dammit!!"]
115: 1889| [45] [The security guard pulled out his extendable baton--]
116: 1907| [47] [Salyu]
117: 1910| [45] ["Shah!!"]
118: 1980| [47] [Security Guard]
119: 1983| [45] ["Kyah!!"]
120: 1988| [45] [But as soon as he got it at the ready, Salyu front kicked his wrist.]
121: 1993| [45] [The baton tumbled onto the ground. But Salyu didn't stop.]
122: 1998| [45] [Her gracefully executed roundhouse kick drew an arc through the air and into the back of his neck.]
123: 2068| [47] [Security Guard]
124: 2071| [45] ["Gh... ghh..."]
125: 2137| [45] [The security guard muttered a moan and collapsed to the ground.]
126: 2142| [47] [Security Guard]
127: 2145| [45] ["Gh, agh, aagh...!"]
128: 2150| [45] [He tried to get up. But his knee gave out and he couldn't stand.]
129: 2176| [47] [Salyu]
130: 2179| [45] ["You should stop resisting. You have no chance to succeed."]
131: 2207| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2210| [45] ["Stop it, Salyu! You're going overboard!"]
133: 2215| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed up next to Salyu and tried to be the voice of reason.]
134: 2248| [45] [He stood between Salyu and the security guard and interrogated the man.]
135: 2256| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2259| [45] ["... You're with Q, aren't you?"]
137: 2264| [47] [Security Guard]
138: 2267| [45] ["..."]
139: 2272| [45] [The security guard didn't answer. His facial expression merely moved ever so slightly.]
140: 2277| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2278| [45] [(--There's no doubt about it. He's a terrorist!)]
142: 2283| [45] [Natsuhiko continued with conviction.]
143: 2291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2294| [45] ["Because of you, we had the security department breathing down our necks."]
145: 2302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2305| [45] ["We're gonna prove our innocence by turning you in to the security department and making you talk."]
147: 2310| [45] [The security guard's face warped.]
148: 2315| [45] [He staggered up to his feet.]
149: 2320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2321| [45] [(There's no point trying to escape with a pitiful limp like that. The security department's swarming all over the place.)]
151: 2326| [45] [--The moment he thought that, Mashiro's voice echoed in the alley.]
152: 2359| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 2362| [45] ["Th-that's right! This is the end of your evil deeds!"]
154: 2370| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2373| [45] ["!! Mashiro, I said not to come, stupid!"]
156: 2378| [45] [He turned around and shouted at Mashiro-- which created just a moment's opening.]
157: 2383| [47] [Security Guard]
158: 2386| [45] ["!!"]
159: 2391| [45] [The security guard pulled a small knife out of his pocket.]
160: 2424| [47] [Salyu]
161: 2427| [45] ["Natsuhiko, watch out!"]
162: 2432| [45] [The sound of Salyu's voice left Natsuhiko breathless.]
163: 2437| [45] [The security guard readied himself--]
164: 2442| [47] [Security Guard]
165: 2445| [45] ["Uwwooogghh!!"]
166: 2500| [45] [--and stabbed the knife into his own stomach.]
167: 2599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2602| [45] ["--... Huh?"]
169: 2607| [45] [Natsuhiko doubted his eyes.]
170: 2612| [45] [The spray of blood from the man's stomach splashed onto Salyu's face.]
171: 2620| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2623| [45] ["Ah..."]
173: 2628| [45] [Time seemed to stop for a moment.]
174: 2633| [45] [But that was of course, just an illusion--]
175: 2641| [47] [Mashiro]
176: 2644| [45] ["Kyaaaahhhh!!"]
177: 2649| [45] [Mashiro's scream snapped Natsuhiko and Salyu back to their senses.]
178: 2657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2660| [45] ["H-he stabbed... himself!?"]
180: 2668| [47] [Salyu]
181: 2671| [45] ["Why...!?"]
182: 2676| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2677| [45] [(Don't tell me he did it to avoid getting apprehended by the security department!?)]
184: 2682| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2683| [45] [(Since he succeeded in blowing up the PRC, his duty is done!? So he's basically a suicide bomber!?)]
186: 2688| [45] [Mashiro shouted to the confused Natsuhiko.]
187: 2696| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 2699| [45] ["W... we need to take him to the hospital!"]
189: 2707| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2710| [45] ["Huh!? Th-this terrorist!?"]
191: 2718| [47] [Mashiro]
192: 2721| [45] ["Of course! Wh-what if he dies!?"]
193: 2726| [45] [Certainly, taking a life was not their intention in the slightest.]
194: 2731| [45] [Salyu spoke up quietly.]
195: 2739| [47] [Salyu]
196: 2742| [45] ["If he dies, then we won't be able to prove our innocence."]
197: 2750| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2753| [45] ["Th-that's right! Let's call an ambulance!"]
199: 2758| [45] [But they didn't have their PDAs on them to call 119.]
200: 2763| [45] [The kids reluctantly dashed out of the alley to look for a payphone.]
201: 2854| [45] [As they got out, they heard some onlookers talking amongst themselves.]
202: 2859| [47] [Onlooker 1]
203: 2862| [45] ["Hey, did you hear a scream?"]
204: 2867| [47] [Onlooker 2]
205: 2870| [45] ["Did it have anything to do with that telepathy earlier?"]
206: 2875| [45] [And then mixed in with those onlookers, they saw familiar people lingering around.]
207: 2880| [45] [They were the men they had been fearing ever since yesterday.]
208: 2942| [47] [Salyu]
209: 2945| [45] ["The security department...!"]
210: 2972| [47] [Mashiro]
211: 2975| [45] ["Oh no! What do we do!?"]
212: 2980| [45] [A few minutes ago, they would've run. But the situation was different now.]
213: 2988| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2991| [45] ["Ghh... it might be a long shot, but let's turn the culprit over to them!"]
215: 3017| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 3020| [45] ["Huh!?"]
217: 3028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 3031| [45] ["If we tell the security department, I'm pretty sure they'll call an ambulance for us, and besides--"]
219: 3039| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3042| [45] ["If we want to clear our names, now might be our only chance."]
221: 3068| [47] [Salyu]
222: 3071| [45] ["Are you sure it won't complicate things if we showed them that crime scene!?"]
223: 3097| [47] [Mashiro]
224: 3100| [45] ["If they saw it, they'd accuse us of stabbing an upstanding citizen in retaliation for filing a report on us!"]
225: 3108| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3111| [45] ["I know it's a gamble, but we can't keep running forever, can we!?"]
227: 3119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3122| [45] ["Besides, if we don't act quick, he'll die! No more running. No more hiding. Our best option is to talk to the security department now and get them to understand the truth!"]
229: 3148| [47] [Mashiro]
230: 3151| [45] ["Y-you're right. Okay...!"]
231: 3156| [45] [Mashiro took a deep breath and yelled.]
232: 3182| [47] [Mashiro]
233: 3185| [45] ["Security department people, over here please! The PRC bomber's over here!!"]
234: 3193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3196| [45] ["And he's attempted suicide, too! Please call an ambulance!"]
236: 3201| [47] [Security Dept.]
237: 3204| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
238: 3209| [45] [The security department members rushed over once they heard the kids' voices.]
239: 3214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3215| [45] [(We've done what we could...)]
241: 3220| [45] [As he watched the security department members rush in, Natsuhiko prayed.]
242: 3225| [45] [He prayed they made the right choice to clear their names of the false charge--]
