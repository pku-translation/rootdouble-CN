  1:   84| [45] [--Mashiro made dinner that day just like any other day.]
  2:  274| [45] [Everyone sat around the table.]
  3:  311| [45] [The only difference today was the addition of Salyu.]
  4:  316| [45] [The conversation was shockingly sparse.]
  5:  357| [45] [Mashiro asked Salyu various questions, but only received short, blunt answers.]
  6:  362| [45] [Yuuri was here too, but Salyu basically didn't speak to her. Same with Natsuhiko.]
  7:  397| [45] [And thus, dinner ended without any improvement to the awkward atmosphere.]
  8:  528| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  531| [45] ["--Okay, you three, I better be heading home soon."]
 10:  539| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  542| [45] ["Yeah, thanks again for today."]
 12:  568| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  571| [45] ["See you tomorrow, Mashiron~"]
 14:  594| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  597| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 16:  602| [45] [After Salyu gave a noncommittal response, Mashiro sent her a fleeting glance and then spoke.]
 17:  625| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  628| [45] ["So, Natsuhiko, would you mind walking me back for just a bit?"]
 19:  636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  639| [45] ["Huh? That's odd. You usually don't ask me to..."]
 21:  644| [45] [Right as Natsuhiko began to talk,]
 22:  713| [85] [{Take a hint.]
 23:  715| [85] [I want to talk to you about Salyu's situation.}]
 24:  731| [86] [Mashiro]
 25:  732| [86] [{Take a hint. I want to talk to you about Salyu's situation.}]
 26:  761| [45] [Mashiro continued by means of telepathy.]
 27:  769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  772| [45] ["... Y-yeah, you're right. Okay."]
 29:  795| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  798| [45] ["Thanks."]
 31:  803| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and left the house with Mashiro.]
 32:  984| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  987| [45] ["Oh boy~... Things sure have taken an unexpected turn, huh?"]
 34:  992| [45] [Mashiro said with a wry smile as they left the entryway.]
 35: 1000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36: 1003| [45] ["You can say that again..."]
 37: 1029| [47] [Mashiro]
 38: 1032| [45] ["You don't like it, Natsuhiko?"]
 39: 1040| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40: 1043| [45] ["I'm not particularly bothered by it, personally. I'm just worried about how Yuuri feels about it."]
 41: 1069| [47] [Mashiro]
 42: 1072| [45] ["... Of course..."]
 43: 1080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44: 1083| [45] ["I'm just worried the sudden change in environment could open up old wounds for Yuuri... I hope she's okay."]
 45: 1088| [45] [Naturally, Mashiro was also aware of how Yuuri's past experiences prevented her from going outside.]
 46: 1093| [45] [Mashiro and Natsuhiko had consulted each other from time to time and agreed to "quietly watch over her", but--]
 47: 1119| [47] [Mashiro]
 48: 1122| [45] ["Hmm, it might be rash of me to think this, but... maybe it'll actually be beneficial for her in that regard?"]
 49: 1130| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50: 1133| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean?"]
 51: 1159| [47] [Mashiro]
 52: 1162| [45] ["If nothing changes, Yuuri will never be able to rejoin 'society'."]
 53: 1170| [47] [Mashiro]
 54: 1173| [45] ["And to be honest, I really think that's a bad thing for her."]
 55: 1181| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56: 1184| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 57: 1256| [47] [Mashiro]
 58: 1259| [45] ["But living with Salyu means she gets to come in contact with people besides us, see?"]
 59: 1285| [47] [Mashiro]
 60: 1288| [45] ["I think that'll be a plus for Yuuri. And maybe even the professor brought Salyu here with that same intention?"]
 61: 1296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1299| [45] ["I wonder..."]
 63: 1304| [45] [Natsuhiko could only halfway agree with that assessment.]
 64: 1309| [45] [Mashiro's reasoning made sense, but he didn't expect that sort of thoughtfulness from his cold mother.]
 65: 1346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1349| [45] ["... True, Yuuri didn't really look like she was that against it."]
 67: 1375| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 1378| [45] ["Hopefully that's the case. Well, let's just settle into it. I'll be there to help in my own way."]
 69: 1386| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1389| [45] ["I see... I'm sorry you had to get involved in all this too, Mashiro."]
 71: 1415| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1418| [45] ["Nah, it's fine, it's fine."]
 73: 1444| [47] [Mashiro]
 74: 1447| [45] ["More importantly, I'm worried about how Salyu feels too. Not just Yuuri."]
 75: 1456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1459| [45] ["... I'm just a little worried about Yuuri's reaction..."]
 77: 1485| [47] [Mashiro]
 78: 1488| [45] ["Yeah... She didn't seem that against it, but still."]
 79: 1514| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1517| [45] ["Well, let's just settle into it. I'll be there to help in my own way."]
 81: 1525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1528| [45] ["Yeah. I'm counting on you."]
 83: 1533| [45] [Once Natsuhiko nodded, Mashiro suddenly noticed something.]
 84: 1559| [47] [Mashiro]
 85: 1562| [45] ["Actually, I'm worried about how Salyu feels too. Not just Yuuri."]
 86: 1570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1573| [45] ["How Salyu feels?"]
 88: 1581| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1584| [45] ["I mean look, that poor girl's probably nervous, don't you think? I mean, she's been so quiet."]
 90: 1593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1596| [45] ["Huh... nervous?"]
 92: 1604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1607| [45] ["Was that what it looked like to you...?"]
 94: 1633| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1636| [45] ["Well, yeah. All things said and done, she's still just a 13-year-old girl, you know?"]
 96: 1645| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1648| [45] ["Huh... nervous, you say?"]
 98: 1656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1659| [45] ["It looked like she was just being rude to me..."]
100: 1685| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 1688| [45] ["Idiot! What do you think you're saying!? You're so immature!"]
102: 1696| [47] [Mashiro]
103: 1699| [45] ["Look, Natsuhiko. All things said and done, she's still just a 13-year-old girl, you know?"]
104: 1725| [47] [Mashiro]
105: 1728| [45] ["Of course she'd be nervous when told she has to live with an older boy."]
106: 1736| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1739| [45] ["Go talk to her some more so she can relax a bit, okay?"]
108: 1747| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1750| [45] ["I-I guess you're right..."]
110: 1755| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't bring himself to agree, but for now he decided to just go along with what she said.]
111: 1763| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1766| [45] ["Okay, I guess I'll give it a shot."]
113: 1792| [47] [Mashiro]
114: 1795| [45] ["That answer again?"]
115: 1803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1806| [45] ["Ah, no, it's not like I'm trying to just blow you off or anything."]
117: 1832| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 1835| [45] ["Hahah, nah, it's okay. I'm counting on you."]
119: 1861| [47] [Mashiro]
120: 1864| [45] ["Well, see you tomorrow, Natsuhiko."]
121: 1872| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1875| [45] ["Yeah, later."]
123: 1924| [45] [Mashiro patted Natsuhiko on the shoulder before walking off into the night.]
124: 1930| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1931| [45] [(Geez, she's so softhearted...)]
126: 1936| [45] [That was also one of Mashiro's good points, but--]
127: 1944| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1947| [45] ["When it comes to me, it gets kind of difficult..."]
129: 1991| [45] [He muttered before heading back to the house, but then--]
130: 2013| [47] [Salyu]
131: 2016| [45] ["What's difficult?"]
132: 2026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2029| [45] ["!?"]
134: 2034| [45] [A voice called out from the darkness of the entryway, startling Natsuhiko.]
135: 2042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2045| [45] ["H-how long have you been there, Salyu?"]
137: 2105| [47] [Salyu]
138: 2108| [45] ["I just came out. Since you were taking so long to get back."]
139: 2116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 2119| [45] ["... Did you hear my conversation with Mashiro?"]
141: 2145| [47] [Salyu]
142: 2148| [45] ["No, not at all."]
143: 2153| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2154| [45] [(Really, now...?)]
145: 2159| [45] [Natsuhiko had some doubts, but he couldn't read anything out of Salyu's expression.]
146: 2167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2170| [45] ["Nah, it was a pretty dumb conversation anyway. Something about how you're oh so cute..."]
148: 2175| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to gloss things over, but immediately--]
149: 2180| [47] [Stuffed Animal]
150: 2183| [45] ["Kyuu~..."]
151: 2188| [45] [The stuffed animal in Salyu's arms squealed.]
152: 2214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2217| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
154: 2225| [47] [Salyu]
155: 2228| [45] ["...!"]
156: 2233| [45] [Natsuhiko was once again startled. At the same time, Salyu's expression stiffened.]
157: 2241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2244| [45] ["S-Salyu? Did that thing just squeal?"]
159: 2270| [47] [Salyu]
160: 2273| [45] ["What of it?"]
161: 2278| [45] [Salyu answered as if it were only natural for it to squeal like that.]
162: 2283| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2284| [45] [(What of it...? Is there some sort of trick behind that thing?)]
164: 2289| [45] [Salyu abruptly spoke in Natsuhiko's confusion.]
165: 2315| [47] [Salyu]
166: 2318| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you're keeping your guard up around me, aren't you?"]
167: 2326| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2329| [45] ["Huh? No, I wouldn't say that..."]
169: 2355| [47] [Salyu]
170: 2358| [45] ["That would be upsetting."]
171: 2366| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2369| [45] ["I was sent here to protect you, after all."]
173: 2377| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2380| [45] ["Huh...? You... protect me?"]
175: 2388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2391| [45] ["Hold on a second, why would you have to protect me?"]
177: 2417| [47] [Salyu]
178: 2420| [45] ["The professor asked."]
179: 2428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 2431| [45] ["Mom did!? No, but still, I mean... what exactly would you have to protect me from?"]
181: 2439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 2442| [45] ["I'm not exactly a VIP or anything."]
183: 2468| [47] [Salyu]
184: 2471| [45] ["The professor said 'It's dangerous around here lately. There's no telling what he could get dragged into or when.'"]
185: 2479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
186: 2482| [45] ["Wha...?"]
187: 2534| [45] [Natsuhiko honestly couldn't understand Salyu's words or his mother's intentions.]
188: 2539| [45] [Salyu may have been good at sports and studies, but she would be the last person you'd imagine to be a bodyguard.]
189: 2558| [47] [Natsuhiko]
190: 2561| [45] ["Why do -I- have to be 'protected' by a girl like you? Isn't it normally the other way around?"]
191: 2569| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2572| [45] ["Not like I have any obligation to protect you, though..."]
193: 2598| [47] [Salyu]
194: 2601| [45] ["It's not like I have any obligation to protect you either."]
195: 2609| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2612| [45] ["...? Not following you here."]
197: 2620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2623| [45] ["What exactly could I get dragged into in the first place--"]
199: 2710| [45] [The moment he started to speak, Natsuhiko suddenly remembered what happened yesterday.]
200: 2761| [45] [--Salyu was there at the scene of Ukita's accident.]
201: 2898| [47] ["Strange things might start happening around you from now on."]
202: 2916| [47] ["But for now, just please be careful...!"]
203: 3019| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 3020| [45] [(Come to think of it, Mr. Ukita did say that...)]
205: 3072| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't help but feel that those words and that situation had something to do with all this.]
206: 3077| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 3078| [45] [(Don't tell me that Salyu's arrival could've been one of those "strange things" Mr. Ukita was talking about?)]
208: 3083| [45] [Or did he mean that even stranger things were going to start occurring?]
209: 3088| [45] [Did Salyu come here to protect Natsuhiko when that time came?]
210: 3107| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3110| [45] ["... Salyu. Does Mom think I'm going to get into some sort of danger?"]
212: 3136| [47] [Salyu]
213: 3139| [45] ["I don't know the particulars either. I was just told to protect you."]
214: 3144| [45] [Salyu answered indifferently.]
215: 3150| [45] [Did she really not know the details, or did she merely not feel like answering?%N--Natsuhiko couldn't even tell.]
216: 3230| [47] [Salyu]
217: 3233| [45] ["... Anyway, Natsuhiko, you should just let me protect you. If you put up your guard around me,%Nit makes my work difficult."]
218: 3259| [47] [Salyu]
219: 3262| [45] ["And it makes me feel bad when you're unkind to me. Stop."]
220: 3270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 3273| [45] ["I-I'm sorry about that..."]
222: 3287| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 2]
223: 3315| [47] [Salyu]
224: 3318| [45] ["As long as you understand. I have a daily routine to do, so I'm going back to my room."]
225: 3344| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3347| [45] ["Huh? Hey, wait..."]
227: 3369| [45] [Salyu abruptly ended their discussion and went back inside.]
228: 3374| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 3375| [45] [(What's with that girl...?)]
230: 3380| [45] [Salyu's attitude was the same as when they parted ways at the Parapsychology Research Center earlier that day.]
231: 3464| [45] [Natsuhiko stood alone at the entryway, pondering Salyu's words.]
232: 3469| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3470| [45] [(But still... protect me how?)]
234: 3541| [45] [Salyu's words were most likely not being made out of the kindness of her heart.]
235: 3646| [45] [She appeared to only be begrudgingly following Dr. Tenkawa's orders.]
236: 3651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 3652| [45] [(Why did Mom really order Salyu to do that...?)]
238: 3688| [45] [After all, Rokumei City excelled in public order. Very rarely did anyone get dragged into a crime.]
239: 3693| [45] [But even so-- there was something that bothered him.]
240: 3798| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 3799| [45] [(Now that I think about it, Mr. Ukita's part of LABO's staff... he's Mom's coworker.)]
242: 3804| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 3805| [45] [(What if that car crash wasn't an accident...?)]
244: 3810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 3811| [45] [(What if some circumstances are causing those with connections to LABO to be targeted?)]
246: 3847| [45] [He considered the thought for a moment, but he couldn't think of any rationale behind it.]
247: 3852| [45] [Why did the professor give neither Natsuhiko nor Salyu a proper explanation?]
248: 3857| [45] [Furthermore, did Salyu really come just to protect Natsuhiko?]
249: 3862| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 3863| [45] ["..."]
251: 3868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 3869| [45] ["..."]
253: 3951| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 3954| [45] ["... It's no use. I don't understand a thing."]
255: 3959| [45] [Natsuhiko muttered to himself and quit trying to think about it.]
256: 3964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 3965| [45] [(Doesn't look like there's going to be any real harm done, so I'll just leave things as they are.)]
258: 3970| [45] [If thinking won't solve something, then just try not to think about it.%NThat was the mantra of Natsuhiko's lifestyle.]
259: 3975| [45] [But even so-- Natsuhiko had a faint worry in the back of his mind.]
260: 3980| [45] [The worry that events he couldn't see were slowly coming to a head...]
