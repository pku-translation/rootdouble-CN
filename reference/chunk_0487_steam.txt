  0:   65| [45] [--It happened nine years ago.]
  1:   70| [45] [To be more exact, it was a memory of when Kazami was still living with Nagisa--]
  2:  112| [47] [Kazami]
  3:  115| [45] ["--Nagisa, I bought you some flowers."]
  4:  141| [47] [Nagisa]
  5:  144| [45] ["Thank you, Sis."]
  6:  149| [45] [Nagisa had begged Kazami to buy her some flowers that day.]
  7:  154| [45] [They were a little tight on savings, but a small gift like that wouldn't do any harm.]
  8:  159| [45] [Since Kazami worked at a flower shop, she could buy as many unsold flowers as she wanted for cheap.]
  9:  185| [47] [Nagisa]
 10:  188| [45] ["What's this flower called?"]
 11:  194| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  197| [45] ["It's a rosemary. Isn't it cute?"]
 13:  223| [47] [Nagisa]
 14:  226| [45] ["Yeah! It smells great too!"]
 15:  231| [45] [Kazami smiled when she saw her sister's nose twitch from the scent.]
 16:  236| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  239| [45] ["But why did you want flowers so suddenly?"]
 18:  265| [47] [Nagisa]
 19:  268| [45] ["Um, well... I thought maybe I wouldn't be so lonely if I had flowers with me while I'm home alone."]
 20:  273| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  276| [45] ["Huh?"]
 22:  302| [47] [Nagisa]
 23:  305| [45] ["You see, whenever I smell flowers, it reminds me of you."]
 24:  313| [47] [Nagisa]
 25:  316| [45] ["'Cause you always smell like flowers."]
 26:  321| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  324| [45] ["Oh, really?"]
 28:  351| [47] [Nagisa]
 29:  354| [45] ["So even when I'm alone, as long as I've got flowers in the room... it makes me feel like you're there with me, and I don't feel lonely anymore."]
 30:  359| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  362| [45] ["..."]
 32:  367| [45] [Nagisa's innocence wrenched Kazami's heart.]
 33:  372| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  373| [45] [(So that's why...)]
 35:  378| [45] [Kazami understand fully well what Nagisa was talking about.]
 36:  383| [45] [The flower shop's manager had told her about it before.]
 37:  389| [45] [According to her, it seemed that "scent memories", as they were known, were actually the strongest memories of them all.]
 38:  394| [45] [Even if normal memories grew faint, those related to scents didn't fade away so easily.]
 39:  399| [45] [She also said that smelling something you once smelled in your past often brought back memories related to that scent.]
 40:  404| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  405| [45] [(... So that's why Nagisa remembers me whenever she smells flowers, huh.)]
 42:  410| [45] [Then perhaps putting flowers in the apartment would help alleviate some of Nagisa's loneliness.]
 43:  415| [45] [It saddened Kazami that she was unable to do anything else for her sister, but--]
 44:  420| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  423| [45] ["... Nagisa, I'll buy you lots of flowers from now on. Sound good?"]
 46:  449| [47] [Nagisa]
 47:  452| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 48:  457| [45] [Nagisa broke out into a broad grin that spread across her whole face, which Kazami returned in due.]
 49:  478| [45] [--It was a memory of their fairly trifling day to day life.]
 50:  483| [45] [Nagisa would some day grow up, and when she did, perhaps her memories of that day and the loneliness of being home alone would be long forgotten.]
 51:  488| [45] [But her memories of the scent of flowers would likely never fade.]
 52:  493| [45] [At least, that's what Kazami hoped.]
 53:  499| [45] [She wished that they'd never forget about these days of modest happiness...]
