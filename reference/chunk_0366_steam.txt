  1:   63| [45] [--Meanwhile--]
  2:   68| [45] [Watase carried Jun as he headed for the control room with Ena.]
  3:   94| [47] [Ena]
  4:   97| [45] ["... You sure she isn't heavy, Captain Kasasagi?"]
  5:  105| [47] [Watase]
  6:  108| [45] ["Yeah, no problems..."]
  7:  141| [45] [Though if he were to be honest, his body was so exhausted that it was taking genuine effort to carry her.]
  8:  146| [45] [His leg was also still in pain from being kicked by Salyu, but he did his best to endure it.]
  9:  151| [47] [Watase]
 10:  152| [45] [(I deserve at least this much pain, anyway...)]
 11:  157| [45] [Just when Watase thought that, he heard Jun groaning behind him.]
 12:  212| [47] [Jun]
 13:  215| [45] ["... Mmm..."]
 14:  220| [45] [The sound of Watase's and Ena's voices seemed to have woken her.]
 15:  228| [47] [Watase]
 16:  231| [45] ["... You awake?"]
 17:  239| [47] [Jun]
 18:  242| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 19:  250| [47] [Jun]
 20:  253| [45] ["... Wait, you're carrying me?"]
 21:  261| [47] [Watase]
 22:  264| [45] ["Yeah. Had to after you lost consciousness back there."]
 23:  272| [47] [Jun]
 24:  275| [45] ["I... see."]
 25:  283| [47] [Watase]
 26:  286| [45] ["We're meeting up with the others in the control room now. We'll be there soon, so I'll keep on carrying you the rest of the way."]
 27:  291| [47] [Jun]
 28:  292| [45] ["..."]
 29:  300| [47] [Jun]
 30:  303| [45] ["... Okay, sure."]
 31:  308| [45] [Jun hesitated for a moment, but decided to go along with what he said.]
 32:  313| [45] [--The three of them continued traveling for a while in silence.]
 33:  318| [45] [Jun eventually broke the ice.]
 34:  374| [47] [Jun]
 35:  377| [45] ["... I just had a dream."]
 36:  385| [47] [Watase]
 37:  388| [45] ["You dreamt? You mean when you were passed out?"]
 38:  396| [47] [Jun]
 39:  399| [45] ["Well, I dunno, really... Maybe it was a little earlier than that."]
 40:  404| [45] [Jun said that uncertainly.]
 41:  409| [45] [Watase was still curious, but he decided to ask a different question.]
 42:  417| [47] [Watase]
 43:  420| [45] ["... What was the dream about?"]
 44:  428| [47] [Jun]
 45:  431| [45] ["It was from when I was a kid..."]
 46:  488| [47] [Jun]
 47:  491| [45] ["... A dream of the day nine years ago where I got caught up in a gas explosion accident in the Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex... and was saved by a rescue worker."]
 48:  496| [45] [Watase gasped when he heard that.]
 49:  504| [47] [Watase]
 50:  507| [45] ["Wait, you mean..."]
 51:  515| [47] [Jun]
 52:  518| [45] ["Hey, Captain... now I finally figured it out."]
 53:  573| [47] [Jun]
 54:  576| [45] ["You were the hero who rescued me back then, weren't you?"]
 55:  581| [47] [Watase]
 56:  582| [45] ["..."]
 57:  590| [47] [Jun]
 58:  593| [45] ["Don't you remember? You carried me out of that room and got me to safety..."]
 59:  598| [45] [Watase silently nodded in response to Jun's whispers.]
 60:  654| [47] [Watase]
 61:  657| [45] ["... Yeah, I do. I recognized you as soon as I saw your face when you were first assigned to my team."]
 62:  665| [47] [Jun]
 63:  668| [45] ["... Why didn't you say anything?"]
 64:  676| [47] [Watase]
 65:  679| [45] ["How could I?"]
 66:  687| [47] [Watase]
 67:  690| [45] ["I'm no longer the hero you think I am."]
 68:  698| [47] [Jun]
 69:  701| [45] ["... That's not true."]
 70:  706| [45] [Jun then spoke to Watase as if to break herself free of her sorrow.]
 71:  714| [47] [Jun]
 72:  717| [45] ["You worked your hardest to save everyone's lives, didn't you?"]
 73:  725| [47] [Jun]
 74:  728| [45] ["You're still the hero I admired even now."]
 75:  733| [45] [Watase couldn't nod to that declaration.]
 76:  740| [47] [Watase]
 77:  741| [45] [(A hero...? -Me-...?)]
 78:  789| [47] [Jun]
 79:  792| [45] ["... Hey, about what the Lieutenant said back there..."]
 80:  797| [47] [Watase]
 81:  798| [45] ["..."]
 82:  806| [47] [Jun]
 83:  809| [45] ["Is... is it true...?"]
 84:  817| [47] [Watase]
 85:  820| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 86:  825| [45] [Watase resigned himself and decided to tell her everything.]
 87:  882| [47] [Watase]
 88:  885| [45] ["I realized it once I got all my memories back... I'm the one who caused this whole incident."]
 89:  893| [47] [Watase]
 90:  896| [45] ["I planned this terrorist plot even as I was working for Sirius."]
 91:  904| [47] [Watase]
 92:  907| [45] ["Though Kazami was wrong about one thing: I didn't kill those five. I haven't killed anyone--"]
 93:  962| [47] [Watase]
 94:  965| [45] ["But there's no denying that I'm the one who indirectly caused their deaths."]
 95:  973| [47] [Watase]
 96:  976| [45] ["I betrayed everyone's trust in me, Moribe."]
 97:  994| [47] [Jun]
 98:  997| [45] ["That's a lie..."]
 99: 1054| [47] [Jun]
100: 1057| [45] ["I mean, Captain... you've been working so hard to save everyone's lives all day..."]
101: 1065| [47] [Watase]
102: 1068| [45] ["That's because I lost my memories."]
103: 1122| [47] [Jun]
104: 1125| [45] ["..."]
105: 1133| [47] [Watase]
106: 1136| [45] ["The 'me' who had amnesia is a completely different person than the man talking to you now."]
107: 1144| [47] [Watase]
108: 1147| [45] ["Back then, I desperately tried to save everyone without even knowing I was the one who put all their lives in danger to begin with."]
109: 1155| [47] [Watase]
110: 1158| [45] ["... That me is long gone. What I truly am is a terrorist--"]
111: 1166| [47] [Jun]
112: 1169| [45] ["That's not true...!"]
113: 1174| [45] [Jun stopped Watase from saying any more.]
114: 1182| [47] [Jun]
115: 1185| [45] ["Just because you got your memories back doesn't mean the Captain from a few hours back is gone for good..."]
116: 1193| [47] [Jun]
117: 1196| [45] ["You're still a true rescue worker who I respect."]
118: 1201| [45] [Watase couldn't nod to that declaration.]
119: 1208| [47] [Watase]
120: 1209| [45] [(A rescue worker...? -Me-...?)]
121: 1264| [45] [Jun had no idea of what was to come.]
122: 1269| [45] [That Watase planned on going back to Q with Yuuri in tow once they got out of there.]
123: 1274| [47] [Watase]
124: 1275| [45] [(If I don't, I...!)]
125: 1280| [45] [Watase didn't speak any further.]
126: 1285| [45] [Nor did Jun or Ena.]
127: 1290| [45] [In the end, the silence between them all remained unbroken--]
128: 1295| [45] [And they made their way out of the connecting passageway.]
