  0:   46| [55] [√After Chapter 2]
  1:   61| [45] [--When they got to the control room, Ena, Yuuri, and Ukita were already there.]
  2:   66| [45] [No sooner had they passed through the doorway than did a bitter shout echo through the room.]
  3:   94| [47] [Ukita]
  4:   97| [45] ["Dammit! I can't steal the root authority!"]
  5:  105| [47] [Watase]
  6:  108| [45] ["M-Mr. Ukita, what's wrong!?"]
  7:  131| [45] [Ukita and the others turned around in surprise.]
  8:  209| [47] [Ena]
  9:  212| [45] ["Oh, welcome back, guys!"]
 10:  238| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  241| [45] ["You three, huh... I heard everything from Ms. Tsubakiyama. Sounds like you went through hell."]
 12:  249| [47] [Watase]
 13:  252| [45] ["Yeah... But we're okay now."]
 14:  257| [45] [None of Watase's group said anything about Kazami's deteriorating condition.]
 15:  265| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  268| [45] ["More importantly, what happened? What's all this stealing authority business about?"]
 17:  294| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  297| [45] ["Well... I've been expending all my efforts towards gaining control of the bulkheads, but..."]
 19:  305| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  308| [45] ["The control system is shielded by thick layers of protection. I don't believe I can do anything against that."]
 21:  334| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  337| [45] ["And unfortunately, the other three control computers are all being guarded by that system."]
 23:  345| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  348| [45] ["It appears it's been set up so that it instantly takes the root authority back from any intruder who manages to steal it by force."]
 25:  374| [47] [Ukita]
 26:  377| [45] ["And to be honest, there's nothing I can do about it with my level of skill..."]
 27:  385| [47] [Watase]
 28:  388| [45] ["... I see."]
 29:  441| [45] [Everyone's faces fell at Ukita's explanation.]
 30:  446| [45] [Though it'd only been a half-hearted hope, it still came off as a big disappointment.]
 31:  472| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  475| [45] ["... But, and while I wouldn't say this makes up for that, I learned several things during this process."]
 33:  483| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  486| [45] ["Please look at the monitor, everyone."]
 35:  491| [45] [Ukita then operated the control panel--]
 36:  536| [45] [--bringing up what appeared to be a map on-screen.]
 37:  544| [47] [Watase]
 38:  547| [45] ["What's this?"]
 39:  556| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  559| [45] ["This is a detailed map of LABO. This is floor B1, where we are presently located..."]
 41:  606| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  609| [45] ["And this is floor B2."]
 43:  617| [47] [Watase]
 44:  620| [45] ["Oh, this'll be a huge help! Now we won't have any more trouble navigating the facility."]
 45:  628| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  631| [45] ["And it's not just a simple map. You can also check out the current situation with it, at least to a certain degree."]
 47:  639| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  642| [45] ["So here's what I learned from it-- First, it appears that all routes leading to the surface really have been locked down with bulkheads. There are no other exits either."]
 49:  650| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  653| [45] ["Incidentally, it would seem that all emergency staircases leading to those bulkheads have collapsed, excluding the one in Area 2's inner ring."]
 51:  661| [47] [Watase]
 52:  664| [45] ["I see..."]
 53:  669| [45] [It was more or less what they'd expected, but it was still disappointing to hear.]
 54:  674| [45] [Kazami pointed to the lower half of the map.]
 55:  682| [47] [Kazami]
 56:  685| [45] ["What's this redded-in portion?"]
 57:  693| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  696| [45] ["Oh, that appears to be an area currently on fire."]
 59:  701| [45] [Just like Kazami had said, the whole area was dyed red.]
 60:  706| [45] [And the letters next to it read "Area 4" "B2"-- it was the fire that Watase, Kazami, and Jun had narrowly escaped from.]
 61:  714| [47] [Jun]
 62:  717| [45] ["Then all these red parts are...!?"]
 63:  722| [45] [B2 of Area 4 wasn't the only area that was red.]
 64:  727| [45] [Area 5 was full of red dots, while almost all of Area 6's outer ring was filled with red.]
 65:  735| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  738| [45] ["Indeed. The bulkheads in these areas have been damaged by the fire, so there may be some radiation leakage happening there."]
 67:  746| [47] [Watase]
 68:  749| [45] ["So that's why the Procyon's reading rose so much, huh..."]
 69:  805| [47] [Jun]
 70:  808| [45] ["If we can seal up the damaged bulkheads, will that stop the reading from going up?"]
 71:  834| [47] [Ukita]
 72:  837| [45] ["It will not be an easy task... We don't know what parts are damaged, after all. It's highly possible that the majority of it is broken."]
 73:  845| [47] [Ukita]
 74:  848| [45] ["And there's no chance that we can suppress the radiation with makeshift repair work."]
 75:  856| [47] [Watase]
 76:  859| [45] ["Great. Just great... We can't continue with our search like this."]
 77:  864| [45] [The lower floor was now completely off-limits to them, and they still needed to find Kazami some AD quickly.]
 78:  869| [45] [And with all the areas ahead of them on fire, there was also the survivors' safety to worry about.]
 79:  895| [47] [Kazami]
 80:  898| [45] ["... Then let's start thinking. We need to decide what to do next based on this new information."]
 81:  903| [45] [The group meekly nodded.]
 82:  911| [47] [Watase]
 83:  914| [45] ["The first order of business is finding AD, stat."]
 84:  922| [47] [Watase]
 85:  925| [45] ["We can't leave Tachibana in this condition forever."]
 86:  951| [47] [Ena]
 87:  954| [45] ["Good point... But where do we find some?"]
 88:  980| [47] [Ukita]
 89:  983| [45] ["We had planned to search the lower floor, but it's on fire..."]
 90:  988| [45] [Suddenly, Yuuri, who hadn't said a word so far, finally broke her silence.]
 91: 1014| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1017| [45] ["U-Um... I found this while I was waiting..."]
 93: 1025| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1028| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 95: 1033| [45] [He looked at Yuuri to find she was holding what looked like a small notebook.]
 96: 1059| [47] [Jun]
 97: 1062| [45] ["What is that, Yuuri?"]
 98: 1070| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1073| [45] ["It appears to be this facility's 'disaster prevention manual'. According to this page..."]
100: 1078| [45] [Yuuri opened to a certain page and showed it to everyone.]
101: 1083| [45] [The group walked over to her and took a look at it.]
102: 1121| [45] ["Disaster Prevention Manual (2030 Edition)"]
103: 1124| [85] [　]
104: 1127| [45] [<Before a Case N>]
105: 1130| [85] [　]
106: 1133| [45] [In the event of an emergency in the facility such as a fire or accident, please also be wary of a Case N.]
107: 1136| [45] [Do as this manual says and first secure some AD.]
108: 1139| [45] [And in the chance that a Case N does indeed occur, please take the following countermeasures.]
109: 1143| [85] [ %N]
110: 1146| [45] [<Case N Countermeasures>]
111: 1149| [85] [　]
112: 1152| [45] [The first thing you should do in the event of a Case N is administer yourself with AD.]
113: 1155| [45] [Though the passages leading to the surface will be sealed off with bulkheads, this is no cause for panic.]
114: 1158| [45] [Please remain calm, go in the nearest room you can find, and wait for help to arrive.]
115: 1205| [47] [Ena]
116: 1208| [45] ["... For 9 hours? Don't ask the impossible."]
117: 1216| [47] [Ukita]
118: 1219| [45] ["No, that part's due to a system error. The lockdown would normally be lifted much earlier than that."]
119: 1227| [47] [Watase]
120: 1230| [45] ["Wait, there's more."]
121: 1268| [85] [ %N]
122: 1271| [45] [<About AD>]
123: 1274| [85] [　]
124: 1277| [45] [There is AD on reserve in every area.]
125: 1280| [45] [We recommend that all personnel look into and confirm where the AD in their own area is being kept.]
126: 1283| [45] [In the emergency that the AD has been damaged and you do not have enough, there should be plenty of spare AD in Areas 1, 3, and 5.]
127: 1286| [45] [Please obtain some as quickly as you can and administer it.]
128: 1358| [45] [--There were a few more entries after that, but that appeared to be the only information that pertained to their current situation.]
129: 1363| [45] [Watase broke out into a smile at this new knowledge.]
130: 1371| [47] [Watase]
131: 1374| [45] ["Plenty of spare AD...!"]
132: 1390| [47] [Watase]
133: 1393| [45] ["This information's a lifesaver! Thanks, Yuuri!"]
134: 1419| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1422| [45] ["Y-you're welcome..."]
136: 1427| [45] [Yuuri gave a smile tinged with a faint hint of joy.]
137: 1478| [47] [Ena]
138: 1481| [45] ["It says there's spare AD in Areas 1, 3, and 5... but is that actually true?"]
139: 1535| [47] [Ena]
140: 1538| [45] ["Is there really spare AD in Areas 1, 3, and 5?"]
141: 1564| [47] [Jun]
142: 1567| [45] ["Well, now that I think about it, we did find a medical box with five AD in it in Area 1, so there's that."]
143: 1575| [47] [Watase]
144: 1578| [45] ["Mmph, that's less than I thought. Well, I guess there was enough originally, it's just..."]
145: 1604| [47] [Kazami]
146: 1607| [45] ["Area 1 was also on fire at first. Most of the spare AD probably burned up in it."]
147: 1633| [47] [Ukita]
148: 1636| [45] ["Then what about Area 3?"]
149: 1644| [47] [Watase]
150: 1647| [45] ["We found a medical box, but it was empty. Someone must have beat us to it."]
151: 1673| [47] [Ena]
152: 1676| [45] ["... That's too bad. Then is there anywhere we haven't searched yet?"]
153: 1702| [47] [Kazami]
154: 1705| [45] ["There is..."]
155: 1710| [45] [Kazami looked at the monitor.]
156: 1758| [47] [Kazami]
157: 1761| [45] ["Area 3's outer ring on B1. We couldn't get in there because the card slot at the security gate was broken."]
158: 1769| [47] [Watase]
159: 1772| [45] ["Oh yeah, I remember that now."]
160: 1777| [45] [The map showed one of the three routes to that place was blocked off by fire.]
161: 1782| [45] [And according to Kazami, one of the others had a security slot that'd been incinerated.]
162: 1787| [45] [And the final route, the only one Watase had personally been through, had a broken card slot.]
163: 1813| [47] [Jun]
164: 1816| [45] ["So we might be able to get in if we can put the fire out in that passageway. But I think putting out that fire is nearly beyond human help now..."]
165: 1821| [45] [Ukita suddenly spoke up when he heard Jun's comment.]
166: 1847| [47] [Ukita]
167: 1850| [45] ["Wait...!? If you say it's impossible with human help, then...!"]
168: 1876| [47] [Ukita]
169: 1879| [45] ["All right! If my plan goes well, then we can solve both our AD and fire problems in one fell swoop!"]
170: 1887| [47] [Watase]
171: 1890| [45] ["What!? Do you have something in mind?"]
172: 1916| [47] [Ukita]
173: 1919| [45] ["Yes. Take a look at this map."]
174: 1924| [45] [Ukita proceeded to operate the control panel again.]
175: 1968| [45] [A strange map then popped up, one that did not appear to be of B1 or B2.]
176: 1973| [45] [In the first place, it didn't have any detailed descriptions of anything apart from Area 3.]
177: 1981| [47] [Watase]
178: 1984| [45] ["What's this map of?"]
179: 1992| [47] [Ukita]
180: 1995| [45] ["This is an equipment storage block between the first floor and B1."]
181: 2003| [47] [Ukita]
182: 2006| [45] ["Think of it as something like an attic of sorts."]
183: 2015| [47] [Ukita]
184: 2018| [45] ["Anyway, this part here is what I wanted to show you..."]
185: 2065| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2068| [45] ["The 'Engine Room'."]
187: 2073| [45] [Those words caused Watase to remember the note he'd found earlier on.]
188: 2081| [47] [Watase]
189: 2084| [45] ["Could the engine room be--"]
190: 2092| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2095| [45] ["--where the sprinkler system is housed!?"]
192: 2121| [47] [Ukita]
193: 2124| [45] ["Indeed. All the sprinklers are offline right now, yes?"]
194: 2150| [47] [Ukita]
195: 2153| [45] ["It appears that the sprinkler system has been shut off for some reason..."]
196: 2161| [47] [Ukita]
197: 2164| [45] ["But if we go there, we should be able to restore it. It'll be a great help in dealing with those fires."]
198: 2172| [47] [Watase]
199: 2175| [45] ["Are you serious!? How do we get there, then!?"]
200: 2184| [47] [Ukita]
201: 2187| [45] ["Well, according to the map--"]
202: 2234| [47] [Ukita]
203: 2237| [45] ["... Through here. Through that block we were just talking about."]
204: 2245| [47] [Ukita]
205: 2248| [45] ["In other words, there's a ladder to the engine room in this room in B1 of Area 3's outer ring."]
206: 2256| [47] [Ukita]
207: 2259| [45] ["So if we can just get into that block somehow--"]
208: 2267| [47] [Watase]
209: 2270| [45] ["We can put out the fires and get our hands on some AD!"]
210: 2324| [45] [Those words brought the whole group's spirits up.]
211: 2332| [47] [Kazami]
212: 2335| [45] ["Captain... this is good news!"]
213: 2343| [47] [Jun]
214: 2346| [45] ["Damn straight it is! Nice job, Mr. Ukita!"]
215: 2372| [47] [Ukita]
216: 2375| [45] ["Oh, uh, you're welcome..."]
217: 2380| [45] [Ukita scratched his head in embarrasment.]
218: 2406| [47] [Yuuri]
219: 2409| [45] ["But the problem is getting there, isn't it...?"]
220: 2481| [47] [Ena]
221: 2484| [45] ["Yeah. Maybe we should try to put out those fires in that burning hallway?"]
222: 2510| [47] [Kazami]
223: 2513| [45] ["No, those flames are far too powerful. It's dangerous."]
224: 2521| [47] [Kazami]
225: 2524| [45] ["I propose that we repair the broken card slot instead."]
226: 2529| [47] [Watase]
227: 2530| [45] [(What to do...?)]
228: 2535| [45] [Watase thought it over for a second and soon came to his answer.]
229: 2551| [47] [Watase]
230: 2554| [45] ["Say, Tachibana, why don't we go to the passageway? We might be able to put out that fire if we try, you know?"]
231: 2626| [47] [Kazami]
232: 2629| [45] ["That's... true, but..."]
233: 2634| [45] [Kazami looked really uneasy about that prospect.]
234: 2646| [45] [But Watase stuck to his opinion in spite of that.]
235: 2656| [47] [Watase]
236: 2657| [45] [(Hold on... if Tachibana of all people is so reluctant about the idea, then we shouldn't go...)]
237: 2662| [45] [Watase changed his mind and spoke up.]
238: 2670| [47] [Watase]
239: 2673| [45] ["... No, sorry. We really should go with Tachibana's plan."]
240: 2681| [47] [Watase]
241: 2684| [45] ["We don't know for sure that trying to repair the card slot will be a dead end unless we've all given it a shot, right?"]
242: 2696| [47] [Watase]
243: 2699| [45] ["Let's go with Tachibana's plan. We don't know for sure that trying to repair the card slot will be a dead end unless we've all given it a shot, right?"]
244: 2725| [47] [Jun]
245: 2728| [45] ["That's right. They always say that 'two heads are better than one', so we should be able to do something with six."]
246: 2754| [47] [Kazami]
247: 2757| [45] ["Everyone, will you please lend us your skills?"]
248: 2783| [47] [Ena]
249: 2786| [45] ["Of course."]
250: 2812| [47] [Ukita]
251: 2815| [45] ["Well, I may be an amateur at rescuing, but I know a bit about machines, so I may be of assistance."]
252: 2841| [47] [Yuuri]
253: 2844| [45] ["I... don't really have any skills, but... I'll try if it comes to it."]
254: 2870| [47] [Jun]
255: 2873| [45] ["Just being there's good enough. Having a girl like you around will put these old men into high spirits, after all."]
256: 2881| [47] [Watase]
257: 2884| [45] ["Old men, huh..."]
258: 2907| [45] [Watase and Ukita looked at each other and exchanged wry smiles.]
259: 2930| [45] [Ukita's face turned serious again a moment later.]
260: 2938| [47] [Ukita]
261: 2941| [45] ["... Now that that's decided, let us make the necessary preparations right away."]
262: 2949| [47] [Ukita]
263: 2952| [45] ["First, everyone here should download this map into your PDAs."]
264: 2960| [47] [Kazami]
265: 2963| [45] ["Good idea. Let's take him up on that, people."]
266: 2968| [45] [Everyone took out their PDAs at Kazami's declaration... except for Yuuri.]
267: 2976| [47] [Watase]
268: 2979| [45] ["Hmm? Yuuri, you don't have a PDA?"]
269: 3005| [47] [Yuuri]
270: 3008| [45] ["N-no... my mom won't let me have one."]
271: 3034| [47] [Jun]
272: 3037| [45] ["Sheesh, you've got a strict family. Reminds me of my folks."]
273: 3063| [47] [Ena]
274: 3066| [45] ["Well, there are families like that here and there."]
275: 3072| [45] [--At any rate, everyone except for Yuuri downloaded the map into their PDA.]
276: 3098| [47] [Ukita]
277: 3101| [45] ["We'll also need a screwdriver to repair the card slot. Any of you rescue workers here have one?"]
278: 3127| [47] [Jun]
279: 3130| [45] ["I always carry an army knife with me. It's a bit tough to use, but it'll still work as both a crosshead and a flathead screwdriver."]
280: 3138| [47] [Ukita]
281: 3141| [45] ["It'll do. Let's give that a try."]
