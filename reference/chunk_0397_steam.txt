  1:   63| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   64| [45] [(My only choice is to erase all of Ms. Tachibana's memories! I don't have time to pick and choose!)]
  3:   69| [45] [Natsuhiko steeled his resolve.]
  4:  127| [45] [He gripped Yuuri's hand and dove into Kazami's mind.]
  5:  276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  277| [45] [(--I'll have to erase all the memories that compose her mind!)]
  7:  282| [45] [Countless memories flickered through the void.]
  8:  287| [45] [Memories of hatred, teeming with malice.]
  9:  292| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  293| [45] [(This is all I can do...!)]
 11:  298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  299| [45] [(Please let this put a stop to it!)]
 13:  361| [45] [Natsuhiko focused his BC one last time, in an attempt to erase Kazami's malice.]
 14:  366| [45] [And that moment--]
 15:  375| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  378| [45] [{Gah... agh...!}]
 17:  383| [45] [Natsuhiko could feel Kazami's pain.]
 18:  388| [45] [... As he endured her suffering, he thought to himself.]
 19:  393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  394| [45] [(... I had no other choice...!)]
 21:  517| [45] [--Natsuhiko then returned to reality--]
 22:  522| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  523| [45] ["..."]
 24:  564| [45] [Kazami slowly collapsed to the floor.]
 25:  569| [45] [Like a marionette whose strings had been cut.]
 26:  602| [47] [Watase]
 27:  605| [45] ["!? Kazami!?"]
 28:  638| [47] [Jun]
 29:  641| [45] ["Sis!"]
 30:  646| [45] [Watase and Jun gasped and ran over to Kazami.]
 31:  651| [45] [It appeared she was unconscious.]
 32:  656| [45] [Watase shook her awake.]
 33:  682| [47] [Watase]
 34:  685| [45] ["Kazami! Kazami!"]
 35:  690| [45] [Shortly afterwards, as if in response to his voice--]
 36:  695| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  696| [45] ["..."]
 38:  730| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  733| [45] ["... Ugh..."]
 40:  738| [45] [Kazami groaned and opened her eyes.]
 41:  764| [47] [Watase]
 42:  767| [45] ["Kazami!"]
 43:  793| [47] [Jun]
 44:  796| [45] ["Are you okay, Sis!?"]
 45:  801| [45] [Watase held Kazami in his arms.]
 46:  806| [45] [But a befuddled look crossed her face when she saw Watase.]
 47:  832| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  835| [45] ["Huh... what...?"]
 49:  861| [47] [Kazami]
 50:  864| [45] ["Who... are you two...?"]
 51:  890| [47] [Jun]
 52:  893| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 53:  898| [45] [Watase and Jun's faces froze over when they heard that.]
 54:  924| [47] [Watase]
 55:  927| [45] ["... Don't tell me..."]
 56:  932| [45] [Watase glared at Natsuhiko, then shouted.]
 57: 1014| [47] [Watase]
 58: 1017| [45] ["Natsuhiko! You erased Kazami's memories--!?"]
 59: 1025| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60: 1028| [45] ["... Yes. I took out Ms. Tachibana's memories."]
 61: 1036| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1039| [45] ["I don't know how many of them are gone..."]
 63: 1047| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1050| [45] ["But I'd say she's probably in the exact same state you were in right after you got amnesia."]
 65: 1076| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1079| [45] ["What!? Do you even realize what you've just done!?"]
 67: 1087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1090| [45] ["Failure was not an option!"]
 69: 1098| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1101| [45] ["Both your life and Ms. Tachibana's were at stake, you know!? It was the only way I could defuse the situation!"]
 71: 1162| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1165| [45] ["..."]
 73: 1170| [45] [Watase fell quiet.]
 74: 1175| [45] [Kazami nervously looked at everyone around her.]
 75: 1202| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1205| [45] ["Wh-what's going on...?"]
 77: 1250| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1253| [45] ["What's happening? Who are you people?"]
 79: 1279| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1282| [45] ["Please tell me! Who..."]
 81: 1308| [47] [Kazami]
 82: 1311| [45] ["Who am I!?"]
 83: 1316| [45] [Kazami shouted on the verge of tears.]
 84: 1321| [45] [There was no sign of her previous composed, firm-hearted nature.]
 85: 1440| [45] [Jun bitterly embraced Kazami.]
 86: 1448| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1451| [45] ["... You have amnesia."]
 88: 1477| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1480| [45] ["Amnesia...!?"]
 90: 1506| [47] [Jun]
 91: 1509| [45] ["But it's okay. There's nothing to be scared of... 'cause I'm here for you..."]
 92: 1535| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1538| [45] ["...?"]
 94: 1543| [45] [Jun continued to embrace Kazami as the confused woman kept staring blankly.]
 95: 1548| [45] [A small sense of guilt filled Natsuhiko's heart.]
 96: 1553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1554| [45] [(... Was this really the only way?)]
 98: 1559| [45] [But he couldn't think of a way that would have resolved everything cleanly.]
 99: 1669| [45] [Watase then finally stood up in what seemed to be resignation and walked up to Natsuhiko.]
100: 1695| [47] [Watase]
101: 1698| [45] ["... You did what you had to do. There was nothing wrong with the way that you did it."]
102: 1703| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103: 1704| [45] ["..."]
104: 1730| [47] [Watase]
105: 1733| [45] ["But this doesn't mean we're out of the woods just yet."]
106: 1741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1744| [45] ["Huh?"]
108: 1749| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and Ena frowned in confusion.]
109: 1775| [47] [Watase]
110: 1778| [45] ["There's something you need to know about the bomb in Area Zero."]
111: 1786| [47] [Watase]
112: 1789| [45] ["We can't disarm it. And to make matters worse--"]
113: 1797| [47] [Watase]
114: 1800| [45] ["It'll go off before the lockdown ends."]
115: 1808| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1811| [45] ["!?"]
117: 1816| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and Ena's eyes widened in shock.]
