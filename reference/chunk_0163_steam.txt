  0:   78| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 3]
  1:   86| [45] [--The trifling small talk continued--]
  2:   97| [45] [And before they realized it, it was already past 10 PM.]
  3:  203| [45] [Yuuri started to doze off.]
  4:  208| [45] [Natsuhiko hesitated before speaking.]
  5:  355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  358| [45] ["... Mashiro, it's about time for you to head home, don't you think?"]
  7:  400| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  403| [45] ["Huh? Oh... would you look at the time."]
  9:  429| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  432| [45] ["Uugh~ I want to talk just a little more, though..."]
 11:  440| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  443| [45] ["But your parents will worry, won't they?"]
 13:  469| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  472| [45] ["Besides, we can see each other again tomorrow."]
 15:  544| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  547| [45] ["Hmm... I guess you're right."]
 17:  573| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  576| [45] ["Okay, well, I guess I'll head home for today, then."]
 19:  684| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  687| [45] ["Okay, Natsuhiko, Salyu, Yuuri. See you tomorrow."]
 21:  728| [47] [Yuuri]
 22:  731| [45] ["Later, Mashiron~"]
 23:  739| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  742| [45] ["Yeah."]
 25:  758| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  761| [45] ["Ah, let me see you out to the entrance at least."]
 27:  787| [47] [Mashiro]
 28:  790| [45] ["Huh? You're the one asking this time? ... Well, okay, I guess."]
 29:  813| [45] [Mashiro agreed to Natsuhiko's suggestion.]
 30:  991| [45] [Once they were out at the entryway, Natsuhiko talked to her.]
 31:  999| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32: 1002| [45] ["Mashiro, thanks for everything today."]
 33: 1028| [47] [Mashiro]
 34: 1031| [45] ["Huuuhh? What's with the formalities?"]
 35: 1039| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36: 1042| [45] ["Ah, well... you helped me and Salyu open up to each other, right?"]
 37: 1068| [47] [Mashiro]
 38: 1071| [45] ["I guess, though I might've just been meddlesome."]
 39: 1079| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40: 1082| [45] ["But it was a good call to throw a welcome party. Eating delicious food together really helped to soften the mood."]
 41: 1109| [47] [Mashiro]
 42: 1112| [45] ["Food has a mysterious power. At times, one even stronger than BC when it comes to bringing people together... I guess."]
 43: 1135| [45] [Mashiro grinned in embarrassment, prompting Natsuhiko to strain a laugh.]
 44: 1143| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45: 1146| [45] ["Either way, I'm sure the man who marries you would be blessed. He'd get to eat food like this every day."]
 46: 1172| [47] [Mashiro]
 47: 1175| [45] ["What's that? A hackneyed pickup line? That's so not your thing, so please cut it out."]
 48: 1183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49: 1186| [45] ["Nah, it's not a pickup line. You just kinda made me want to say that today."]
 50: 1212| [47] [Mashiro]
 51: 1215| [45] ["You're so on the fence... Well, if you're going to praise my cooking, I'll accept that."]
 52: 1220| [45] [Mashiro easily sidestepped Natsuhiko's banter.]
 53: 1225| [45] [It's because he knew she would do that that Natsuhiko could joke like that.]
 54: 1230| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1231| [45] [(... Either way, a future like that's just unimaginable, huh.)]
 56: 1239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1242| [45] ["Well, anyway, thanks. I need to thank you properly before long too."]
 58: 1268| [47] [Mashiro]
 59: 1271| [45] ["Yeah, I'll look forward to it. Well, see you tomorrow, then."]
 60: 1279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1282| [45] ["Yeah, see you tomorrow."]
 62: 1315| [45] [And with their exchange of farewells, Natsuhiko went back inside.]
 63: 1412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1415| [45] ["Yeah, see you tomorrow."]
 65: 1473| [45] [Mashiro left the room with those voices at her back.]
 66: 1558| [45] [As she left, Natsuhiko locked the front door behind her like always.]
 67: 1565| [45] [And then he returned to the living room.]
 68: 1649| [45] [The living room without Mashiro was silence itself.]
 69: 1765| [47] [Yuuri]
 70: 1768| [45] ["Zzz..."]
 71: 1773| [45] [Yuuri was asleep on the sofa.]
 72: 1857| [45] [Salyu seemed sleepy too as she spoke to Natsuhiko.]
 73: 1865| [47] [Salyu]
 74: 1868| [45] ["Okay, Natsuhiko. I have my daily routine, so I'm going back to my room."]
 75: 1876| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1879| [45] ["That reminds me, you said that yesterday too. What kind of daily routine? Studies?"]
 77: 1905| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1908| [45] ["Strength training."]
 79: 1916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1919| [45] ["Huh!? Strength... huh?"]
 81: 1927| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1930| [45] ["... That's another one of your hobbies?"]
 83: 1938| [47] [Salyu]
 84: 1941| [45] ["More of a habit than a hobby. I haven't missed a single day in years."]
 85: 1967| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1970| [45] ["I need to do it every day or I get restless."]
 87: 1978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1981| [45] ["I-I see..."]
 89: 1986| [45] [Salyu's personality was one surprise after another.]
 90: 1994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1997| [45] ["So you're trained in both literary and military arts, huh...? That's amazing."]
 92: 2023| [47] [Salyu]
 93: 2026| [45] ["It's not that big of a deal. Bye."]
 94: 2050| [45] [Salyu hurriedly started to leave the living room.]
 95: 2074| [45] [But she stopped in front of the door to the hallway and whispered.]
 96: 2128| [47] [Salyu]
 97: 2131| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, are you good at reading the mood?"]
 98: 2139| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 2142| [45] ["Huh? What's this all of a sudden?"]
100: 2168| [47] [Salyu]
101: 2171| [45] ["I'm not good at it, so I'm not sure about this, but..."]
102: 2197| [47] [Salyu]
103: 2200| [45] ["It looked to me like everyone had fun today. Did you have fun, Natsuhiko?"]
104: 2216| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 2219| [45] ["Huh? W-well, of course. Did you have a bad time, Salyu?"]
106: 2245| [47] [Salyu]
107: 2248| [45] ["... No."]
108: 2274| [47] [Salyu]
109: 2277| [45] ["I had a lot of fun too."]
110: 2285| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 2288| [45] ["...!"]
112: 2314| [47] [Salyu]
113: 2317| [45] ["If only we could keep on having days like this..."]
114: 2325| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 2328| [45] ["What are you saying? Of course we will."]
116: 2354| [47] [Salyu]
117: 2357| [45] ["... Okay. I'll look forward to that."]
118: 2377| [45] [That's all Salyu said before she left the living room.]
119: 2382| [45] [Natsuhiko just stared blankly at the closed door.]
120: 2390| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 2393| [45] ["... 'Did you have fun'...?"]
122: 2398| [45] [Natsuhiko was surprised at how bluntly Salyu asked about emotions.]
123: 2449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 2450| [45] [(Could this girl... actually be a lot more honest than she lets on...?)]
125: 2554| [45] [Natsuhiko still didn't quite understand Salyu.]
126: 2559| [45] [But his interest in her gradually grew and grew.]
127: 2564| [45] [He kept his guard up around her yesterday, but right now he felt he wanted to get along with her even more.]
128: 2599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 2600| [45] [(I wonder if we can get along...?)]
130: 2605| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2606| [45] [(I wonder if things will work out? Well, I guess Mashiro is trying to bring us together and all.)]
132: 2611| [45] [They had different cultures and personalities, so it seemed like a difficult task.]
133: 2616| [45] [But he felt that if they could clear away the walls they built up in their hearts, they could somehow manage to get along.]
134: 2635| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2638| [45] ["... Yeah, I had fun too."]
136: 2649| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2652| [45] ["Hm? Well, I guess... What about it?"]
138: 2675| [47] [Salyu]
139: 2676| [45] ["..."]
140: 2702| [47] [Salyu]
141: 2705| [45] ["... No, it's nothing. See you tomorrow."]
142: 2725| [45] [That's all Salyu said before she left the living room.]
143: 2730| [45] [Natsuhiko just stared blankly at the closed door.]
144: 2738| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2741| [45] ["... What was that just now? That girl's still a bit of a mystery to me..."]
146: 2746| [45] [As Natsuhiko sighed, he heard a voice from behind him.]
147: 2882| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2885| [45] ["Whaaat's going on...?"]
149: 2890| [45] [Natsuhiko turned back to see a sleepy-eyed Yuuri looking back at him.]
150: 2898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 2901| [45] ["Oh, Yuuri, did I wake you up?"]
152: 2927| [47] [Yuuri]
153: 2930| [45] ["No, it's okay~... I could catch a cold if I slept here anyway..."]
154: 2938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2941| [45] ["True. It's best to sleep in your own room."]
156: 2967| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 2970| [45] ["Okay~..."]
158: 3039| [45] [Yuuri tottered to her feet and started to stagger towards her room.]
159: 3090| [45] [... Or rather she started heading to an empty wall instead of the door.]
160: 3098| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 3101| [45] ["Ah, Yuuri, are you still half-asleep?"]
162: 3127| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 3130| [45] ["Muu~??"]
164: 3138| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 3141| [45] ["Don't muu me. Your room's this way."]
166: 3213| [47] [Yuuri]
167: 3216| [45] ["Guu~..."]
168: 3224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 3227| [45] ["Don't guu me. Wake up... ah."]
170: 3278| [45] [Without responding, Yuuri fell onto Natsuhiko for support.]
171: 3286| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 3289| [45] ["Good grief. Again...?"]
173: 3294| [45] [This was a common occurrence.]
174: 3310| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 3313| [45] ["Fine, excuse me... hup."]
176: 3335| [45] [And each time this happened, Natsuhiko would carry Yuuri like a princess.]
177: 3344| [47] [Yuuri]
178: 3347| [45] ["Mm~... I'm floating~..."]
179: 3355| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 3358| [45] ["Geez. I'd hardly call it floating."]
181: 3363| [45] [Yuuri continued talking in her sleep as they left the living room.]
182: 3448| [45] [They went through the hall towards Yuuri's room.]
183: 3456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 3459| [45] ["C'mon, Yuuri. Here's your room."]
185: 3467| [47] [Yuuri]
186: 3470| [45] ["Zzz, zzz..."]
187: 3475| [45] [No matter how much he called out to her, she wouldn't get up at all.]
188: 3480| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 3481| [45] [(Wait a sec, I'm probably spoiling her too much...)]
190: 3536| [45] [But he'd have been lying if he said he disliked it.]
191: 3572| [45] [Natsuhiko carried Yuuri's body out of the living room.]
192: 3657| [45] [They went through the hall towards Yuuri's room.]
193: 3665| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 3668| [45] ["C'mon, Yuuri. Here's your room."]
195: 3676| [47] [Yuuri]
196: 3679| [45] ["Zzz, zzz..."]
197: 3734| [45] [No matter how much he called out to her, she wouldn't get up at all.]
198: 3739| [45] [Natsuhiko hesitated for a moment before opening the door to Yuuri's room.]
199: 3826| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 3829| [45] ["Pardon the intrusion."]
201: 3905| [45] [Natsuhiko carried Yuuri to her bed and laid her down.]
202: 3920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 3923| [45] ["Here, sleep somewhere warm."]
204: 3928| [45] [As Natsuhiko spoke, Yuuri wrapped herself up on her futon and spoke.]
205: 4014| [47] [Yuuri]
206: 4017| [45] ["Hikori~n... before you go to sleep, read me a bedtime story~..."]
207: 4025| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 4028| [45] ["Huh? A bedtime story? Are you a kid?"]
209: 4036| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 4039| [45] ["It should be fine every now and then, right...?"]
211: 4044| [45] [Yuuri spoke like a child wanting to be pampered.]
212: 4049| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 4050| [45] [(What's going on? She's really acting like a child today.)]
214: 4055| [45] [Natsuhiko answered, a little confused.]
215: 4063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 4066| [45] ["Okay. What should I read?"]
217: 4092| [47] [Yuuri]
218: 4095| [45] ["I'll let you choose, Hikorin~"]
219: 4203| [45] [Natsuhiko chose a suitable-looking picture book off the bookshelf.]
220: 4294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 4297| [45] ["... Hmm, mmhmm. Okay, let's begin then."]
222: 4323| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 4326| [45] ["Yay! *clap* *clap*"]
224: 4384| [45] [Natsuhiko opened the book and started reading the dedication.]
225: 4392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 4395| [45] ["--All grown-ups were once children--"]
227: 4403| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 4406| [45] ["although few of them remember it."]
229: 4411| [47] [Yuuri]
230: 4412| [45] ["..."]
231: 4464| [45] [--As he read, Natsuhiko soon noticed something.]
232: 4469| [45] [Long ago, Yuuri had badgered him to read this very same book.]
233: 4474| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 4475| [45] [(When was that...?)]
235: 4480| [45] [Eventually, the door to Natsuhiko's memories opened.]
236: 4485| [45] [It was a memory from nearly 10 years ago--]
237: 4490| [45] [About a month after he had met Yuuri.]
238: 4568| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 3]
239: 4683| [45] [--That's what Natsuhiko recalled as he read the book.]
240: 4688| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 4689| [45] [(I see... so this is the book from back then, huh?)]
242: 4694| [45] [He read this book many times back then, but he hadn't read it ever since he grew up.]
243: 4710| [45] [As he basked in nostalgia, he happened to look at Yuuri--]
244: 4761| [45] [And before he had realized it, she had closed her eyes.]
245: 4769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 4772| [45] ["... Oh, asleep already?"]
247: 4795| [45] [With a wry smile on his face, Natsuhiko reshelved the book.]
248: 4801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 4802| [45] [(... I wonder if Yuuri remembers what happened back then?)]
250: 4816| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at her sleeping face as he wondered that.]
251: 4824| [45] [And then he looked down on Yuuri from up above.]
252: 4875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 4876| [45] ["..."]
254: 4881| [45] [Even as he looked at her in such a defenseless state, he harbored not a single improper thought.]
255: 4886| [45] [Natsuhiko was unable to see Yuuri as a mature-bodied woman.]
256: 4891| [45] [Even though he was a healthy high school boy, he had never felt any lust at all towards Yuuri.]
257: 4896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
258: 4897| [45] [(What I do feel... is a desire to protect her, I guess.)]
259: 4902| [45] [And not just because they were raised almost like family.]
260: 4907| [45] [Perhaps it was because of the accident nine years ago. Or perhaps it was because of her personality.]
261: 4912| [45] [He didn't understand, but he didn't mind.]
262: 4917| [45] [And that was why they were able to live together without any problems whatsoever.]
263: 4925| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 4928| [45] ["... Good night, Yuuri."]
265: 4933| [45] [Natsuhiko whispered to Yuuri almost in the same way one would whisper to a sister.]
266: 4949| [45] [Obviously, there was no guarantee that these days would never end.]
267: 4954| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 4955| [45] [(Things have been changing since Salyu came...)]
269: 4960| [47] [Natsuhiko]
270: 4961| [45] [(Our current way of living might change little by little too.)]
271: 4966| [45] [Perhaps one day, Yuuri would finally be able to leave this house.]
272: 4971| [45] [Perhaps Mashiro would get a boyfriend and stop visiting, too.]
273: 4976| [45] [But change doesn't have to be immediate.]
274: 4981| [45] [As long as these days were to continue, Natsuhiko wanted to keep spending time like this.]
275: 5074| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered that desire as he began to leave Yuuri's room when--]
276: 5118| [85] ["They won't continue."]
277: 5127| [86] [Yuuri]
278: 5128| [86] ["They won't continue."]
279: 5142| [45] [A voice echoed forth in the dark room.]
280: 5150| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 5153| [45] ["--Huh?"]
282: 5276| [45] [When he turned around, Yuuri was up and looking at him.]
283: 5290| [47] [Yuuri]
284: 5293| [45] ["Everything changes. These days won't continue forever."]
285: 5301| [47] [Yuuri]
286: 5304| [45] ["The nature of change is that by the time you notice it, it's already progressed considerably."]
287: 5330| [47] [Yuuri]
288: 5333| [45] ["That was the case even today. Your sentiment towards Salyu changed considerably in the span of one day, didn't it?"]
289: 5338| [45] [She spoke clearly and firmly-- as if her half-asleep mumbling had been an act.]
290: 5345| [45] [Confused at Yuuri's change in demeanor, Natsuhiko replied without thinking.]
291: 5353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 5356| [45] ["I-it changed...?"]
293: 5364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 5367| [45] ["I don't really think it changed -that- much."]
295: 5393| [47] [Yuuri]
296: 5396| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
297: 5404| [47] [Natsuhiko]
298: 5407| [45] ["I mean, true, we did go shopping together..."]
299: 5415| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 5418| [45] ["But still, I get the strong feeling there's too much I don't know about her..."]
301: 5441| [45] [At Natsuhiko's words, Yuuri-- gave a pitifully sad expression.]
302: 5449| [47] [Yuuri]
303: 5452| [45] ["... Nothing can change your mind, can it?"]
304: 5478| [47] [Yuuri]
305: 5481| [45] ["You refuse to accept Salyu from the bottom of your heart, don't you...?"]
306: 5486| [45] [Her expression and tone of voice were different from the usual Yuuri.]
307: 5491| [45] [Confused, Natsuhiko asked for clarification.]
308: 5499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
309: 5502| [45] ["... What are you talking about, Yuuri?"]
310: 5528| [47] [Yuuri]
311: 5531| [45] ["... You don't know?"]
312: 5557| [47] [Yuuri]
313: 5560| [45] ["She's trying to protect you, Hikorin..."]
314: 5586| [47] [Yuuri]
315: 5589| [45] ["She's even fighting on your behalf right now."]
316: 5595| [45] [The moment Yuuri said that--]
317: 5648| [47] [Natsuhiko]
318: 5651| [45] ["!?"]
319: 5656| [45] [The sight of "September 12" warped before Natsuhiko's eyes,]
320: 5661| [45] [and changed to the sight of "September 16".]
321: 5787| [45] [Natsuhiko felt a hint of fear to see Yuuri like that.]
322: 5795| [47] [Natsuhiko]
323: 5798| [45] ["H-hey, Yuuri..."]
324: 5806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
325: 5809| [45] ["What's been going on with you lately?"]
326: 5835| [47] [Yuuri]
327: 5838| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
328: 5846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
329: 5849| [45] ["I mean, you usually don't say things like that."]
330: 5854| [45] [--And she'd said things like that every day these past few days.]
331: 5905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
332: 5906| [45] [(Are her "symptoms" getting worse...?)]
333: 5911| [45] [But when she was with Salyu, Yuuri seemed like she was having fun.]
334: 5916| [45] [Natsuhiko had essentially no idea of what her mental state was like.]
335: 5935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
336: 5938| [45] ["... What do you mean these days won't continue? Does something give you that impression?"]
337: 5964| [47] [Yuuri]
338: 5967| [45] ["No, nothing gives me that impression... it's just that it's only natural."]
339: 5972| [45] [Yuuri hung her head as she spoke.]
340: 5998| [47] [Yuuri]
341: 6001| [45] ["... And there are other things you will lose along with your peace."]
342: 6027| [47] [Yuuri]
343: 6030| [45] ["Which is exactly why you should treasure what you've got."]
344: 6038| [47] [Yuuri]
345: 6041| [45] ["Because they should be able to guide you, Hikorin..."]
346: 6046| [45] [With each quiet word Yuuri spoke, doubt rose and rose in Natsuhiko's heart.]
347: 6054| [47] [Natsuhiko]
348: 6057| [45] ["Yuuri... what in the world do you...?"]
349: 6080| [45] [As Natsuhiko voiced that question, Yuuri merely pointed to his wristwatch silently.]
350: 6295| [45] [When he looked at that watch-- it was broken.]
351: 6300| [45] [The dial was cracked and it was stopped on 9/16 at 6:19.]
352: 6305| [47] [Natsuhiko]
353: 6306| [45] [(Again!? When did this watch break?)]
354: 6311| [45] [Today should be September 12.]
355: 6316| [45] [So why was it stopped at September 16?]
356: 6321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
357: 6322| [45] [(No, wait...)]
358: 6327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
359: 6328| [45] [(Is today really September 12...!?)]
360: 6333| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko made that realization--]
361: 6381| [45] [His sight blurred and everything warped before his eyes--]
