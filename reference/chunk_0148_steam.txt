  1:   81| [45] [But-- by the time they reached the house, Natsuhiko noticed something strange.]
  2:   89| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   92| [45] ["Huh?"]
  4:   97| [45] [There was a jet black car parked out in front of his house.]
  5:  123| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  126| [45] ["Now that's an expensive-looking car. Whose do you think it is?"]
  7:  134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  137| [45] ["Beats me..."]
  9:  177| [45] [With his head tilted to the side, Natsuhiko walked past the car and entered his home.]
 10:  318| [45] [They took their shoes off at the entrance and headed to the living room when--]
 11:  372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  375| [45] ["I'm... home!?"]
 13:  380| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro were greeted by an unbelievable sight.]
 14:  511| [47] [Natsuhiko & Mashiro]
 15:  514| [45] ["Salyu!?"]
 16:  690| [45] [Salyu was there in the Tenkawas' living room.]
 17:  759| [45] [Yuuri was standing there next to her with a smile.]
 18:  858| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  861| [45] ["Wh... what's this!?"]
 20:  869| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  872| [45] ["Salyu, why are you in my house!?"]
 22:  880| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  883| [45] ["Because I'm going to live here starting today."]
 24:  891| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  894| [45] ["Wha!? You too? Why...!?"]
 26:  902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  905| [45] ["Yuuri, did you hear anything about this?"]
 28:  931| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  934| [45] ["Mmm~"]
 30:  939| [45] [Yuuri didn't clearly answer whether or not she knew about the situation.]
 31:  944| [45] [Salyu spoke to Natsuhiko without giving Yuuri a single glance.]
 32:  970| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  973| [45] ["The decision's been set in stone. There's no more room for argument."]
 34:  999| [47] [Mashiro]
 35: 1002| [45] ["Set in stone...!?"]
 36: 1010| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37: 1013| [45] ["Wait, for starters, why does it have to be -our- house?"]
 38: 1039| [47] [Salyu]
 39: 1042| [45] ["Well--"]
 40: 1047| [45] [At that moment, a voice rang out from further inside the room.]
 41: 1055| [47] [???]
 42: 1058| [45] ["It was my suggestion."]
 43: 1084| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44: 1087| [45] ["!?"]
 45: 1092| [45] [Natsuhiko turned to the voice in disbelief--]
 46: 1399| [47] [Miyoko]
 47: 1402| [45] ["It's been a while, hasn't it, Natsuhiko?"]
 48: 1410| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49: 1413| [45] ["M-Mom...!?"]
 50: 1421| [47] [Mashiro]
 51: 1424| [45] ["Professor!?"]
 52: 1429| [45] [There stood Natsuhiko's mother, Miyoko Tenkawa.]
 53: 1434| [45] [Which meant that the car outside was probably a courtesy car for the professor.]
 54: 1439| [45] [--As a renowned physicist, she was extremely busy by nature.]
 55: 1444| [45] [She was always stationed in LABO and very rarely came home, meaning her communication with her son was essentially nonexistent.]
 56: 1513| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1516| [45] ["You don't say a thing for quite some time, and -this- is how you greet us...?"]
 58: 1542| [47] [Miyoko]
 59: 1545| [45] ["I've been busy, so I couldn't help it, could I?"]
 60: 1553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61: 1556| [45] ["Fine, whatever. Anyway, what's the meaning of this? Why's Salyu going to live here?"]
 62: 1628| [47] [Miyoko]
 63: 1631| [45] ["Yui just moved here from France, so her place of residence hasn't been decided yet."]
 64: 1657| [47] [Miyoko]
 65: 1660| [45] ["So I'm letting her stay here for the time being."]
 66: 1665| [45] [The professor called Salyu by her real name, "Yui". Somewhat intimately.]
 67: 1670| [45] [But that only got on Natsuhiko's nerves.]
 68: 1678| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1681| [45] ["So we have no say in it, huh... What kind of connection do you even have to Salyu, Mom?"]
 70: 1689| [47] [Miyoko]
 71: 1692| [45] ["She's my distant relative. Meaning she's your relative, too."]
 72: 1700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1703| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 74: 1755| [45] [Now that he thought about it, his mother's maiden name was Sannomiya.]
 75: 1760| [45] [And he did get the feeling she said she'd lived in France before, so perhaps they really were related, but still--]
 76: 1779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1782| [45] ["... Is that true?"]
 78: 1808| [47] [Miyoko]
 79: 1811| [45] ["What would I gain by lying about it? My grandfather's younger sister's grandson married a French woman and she's their child."]
 80: 1837| [47] [Miyoko]
 81: 1840| [45] ["That makes you third cousins with 8th degree kinship, though, so you're essentially unrelated."]
 82: 1848| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1851| [45] ["No, in that case, that's even all the more reason why having her live here is a little..."]
 84: 1877| [47] [Miyoko]
 85: 1880| [45] ["Why not? We've got an empty room, don't we?"]
 86: 1912| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1915| [45] ["... Are you okay with that, Salyu?"]
 88: 1956| [47] [Salyu]
 89: 1959| [45] ["No objections here. If that's what the professor wants, then I'll oblige."]
 90: 1985| [47] [Miyoko]
 91: 1988| [45] ["Yes. This decision's set in stone."]
 92: 2038| [47] [Miyoko]
 93: 2041| [45] ["Any other objections, Natsuhiko? I've still got work left to do, so I'll be heading back to LABO."]
 94: 2049| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 2052| [45] ["... Fine, have it your way."]
 96: 2075| [45] [Natsuhiko lost his temper over how the professor slowed down for nobody.]
 97: 2098| [45] [But the professor merely sighed and addressed Mashiro.]
 98: 2194| [47] [Miyoko]
 99: 2197| [45] ["Mashiro, I'm sorry for not asking permission beforehand. Take care of Yui for me, okay?"]
100: 2205| [47] [Mashiro]
101: 2208| [45] ["S-sure. But..."]
102: 2251| [45] [It appeared not even Mashiro could quite understand the situation.]
103: 2256| [45] [She put a finger up to her temple and muttered in a worried tone.]
104: 2282| [47] [Mashiro]
105: 2285| [45] ["It's just all so sudden... but umm, is everything okay?"]
106: 2330| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 2333| [45] ["It is. I already told Yui everything she needs to know about this household."]
108: 2359| [47] [Mashiro]
109: 2362| [45] ["Huh... Is that right, Salyu?"]
110: 2388| [47] [Salyu]
111: 2391| [45] ["Yes, naturally."]
112: 2399| [47] [Salyu]
113: 2402| [45] ["I know about how Natsuhiko and Yuuri live together. And that you know the circumstances and come here to prepare meals, Mashiro."]
114: 2428| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 2431| [45] ["Okay, as long as you know..."]
116: 2457| [47] [Mashiro]
117: 2460| [45] ["I mean, if you didn't know, then... well, I'm sure it'd lead to some misunderstandings."]
118: 2465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 2466| [45] [(Dammit, Mashiro! That's not what's important here...!)]
120: 2471| [45] [The professor ignored Natsuhiko, the only one staunchly against the situation, and continued.]
121: 2497| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 2500| [45] ["Okay, then. Get along now, kids."]
123: 2592| [45] [And with that, the professor slipped past Natsuhiko--]
124: 2628| [45] [And left the house.]
125: 2639| [45] [Soon enough, the car's engine roared and she zoomed away.]
126: 2656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 2659| [45] ["... Hmph. She's as one-sided as ever..."]
128: 2664| [45] [Hearing Natsuhiko's murmur, Salyu spoke out.]
129: 2690| [47] [Salyu]
130: 2693| [45] ["Is it a bother for me to live in this house?"]
131: 2701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2704| [45] ["Huh, oh, no..."]
133: 2730| [47] [Salyu]
134: 2733| [45] ["This isn't what the professor said would happen. She said you guys wouldn't object."]
135: 2741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2744| [45] ["...!"]
137: 2749| [45] [When he heard that, Natsuhiko became furious again.]
138: 2754| [45] [Not at Salyu for saying that, but at his mother for her complete disregard for his and Yuuri's opinions.]
139: 2777| [45] [Yuuri strained to put a smile on her face, somewhat uncomfortably.]
140: 2803| [47] [Mashiro]
141: 2806| [45] ["C'mon, Natsuhiko. What's got you so upset?"]
142: 2832| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 2835| [45] ["What's the problem? The household just got one more member. Doesn't that sound fun and exciting?"]
144: 2843| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2846| [45] ["Yeah, I guess it does..."]
146: 2898| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to sound amicable in front of Salyu.]
147: 2903| [45] [But in his heart of hearts, excitement wasn't exactly what he wanted.]
148: 2908| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 2909| [45] [(There was no way in hell I could've expected this...)]
150: 2914| [45] [His life was changing drastically in ways he couldn't understand.]
151: 2919| [45] [He had just started to let his guard down, only for it to get pushed right back up.]
