  1:   66| [45] [But by the time Watase and Kazami returned to the office in Area 2--]
  2:   71| [45] [The door had been totally destroyed.]
  3:   79| [47] [Watase]
  4:   82| [45] ["Wha... what in the hell!?"]
  5:  143| [47] [Kazami]
  6:  146| [45] ["...!?"]
  7:  151| [45] [There was now a giant hole in the door, one big enough for a human to fit through.]
  8:  156| [45] [Now the destruction of the door opening mechanism meant nothing at all.]
  9:  164| [47] [Watase]
 10:  167| [45] ["Teach!"]
 11:  172| [45] [Watase and Kazami frantically climbed through the hole.]
 12:  274| [45] [But there was no one there.]
 13:  279| [45] [Perhaps Ena had regained consciousness and escaped on her own.]
 14:  284| [45] [Watase was glad that she was apparently okay, but--]
 15:  292| [47] [Watase]
 16:  295| [45] ["Who the hell did this...!? How'd they even break the door in the first place!?"]
 17:  321| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  324| [45] ["..."]
 19:  350| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  353| [45] ["I have a bad feeling about this... Let's get out of here! We need to find a safe place!"]
 21:  361| [47] [Watase]
 22:  364| [45] ["R-right!"]
 23:  369| [45] [Watase and Kazami ran out of the room without a moment's delay.]
 24:  423| [45] [They then neared the connecting passageway to Area 1 when--]
 25:  484| [45] [A strange noise coming from up ahead stopped them in their tracks.]
 26:  492| [47] [Watase]
 27:  495| [45] ["... You hear that?"]
 28:  556| [45] [Watase held his breath, then peeked into the passageway from a nearby corner.]
 29:  656| [47] [Watase]
 30:  657| [45] [(Moribe!?)]
 31:  662| [45] [Jun was about 10 m away, wielding the engine cutter.]
 32:  667| [45] [She muttered something as blood poured down from her head.]
 33:  676| [47] [Jun]
 34:  679| [45] ["Where the hell... is that bastard...!?"]
 35:  687| [47] [Jun]
 36:  690| [45] ["I see... so that really was it all along..."]
 37:  698| [47] [Jun]
 38:  701| [45] ["Then... I have no choice..."]
 39:  709| [47] [Jun]
 40:  712| [45] ["I gotta do it or I can't protect anyone... I gotta kill that son of a bitch..."]
 41:  720| [47] [Jun]
 42:  723| [45] ["I gotta bite the bullet and go through with it...!"]
 43:  734| [45] [Jun talked to thin air as if she were chanting a curse.]
 44:  739| [45] [Watase trembled with fear when he heard her.]
 45:  744| [47] [Watase]
 46:  745| [45] [(... Am -I- that "son of a bitch"..!?)]
 47:  750| [47] [Watase]
 48:  751| [45] [(Moribe doubted me. So if those doubts just kept on escalating...!)]
 49:  756| [45] [It was strange no matter how he thought about it, but with Ukita's attempt on his life still fresh in his mind, that was the only possibility he could come up with.]
 50:  761| [45] [Watase turned around and whispered into Kazami's ear.]
 51:  860| [47] [Watase]
 52:  863| [45] ["This is really bad... Moribe's brought out the engine cutter."]
 53:  889| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  892| [45] ["Khh... Then we have no choice. Let's fall back for the time being."]
 55:  900| [47] [Watase]
 56:  903| [45] ["... You okay with that? I mean, Moribe's like a sister to you..."]
 57:  929| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  932| [45] ["I don't want to, but any attempts at persuading her otherwise will most likely be futile with her in that state...!"]
 59:  949| [55] [√After Chapter 6]
 60:  957| [45] [Watase nodded. He couldn't deny the truth in Kazami's pained statement.]
 61:  962| [45] [But as they tried to walk away--]
 62:  973| [45] [Watase's boots clacked noisily against the floor.]
 63: 1026| [47] [Jun]
 64: 1029| [45] ["Who's there!?"]
 65: 1044| [45] [The sound of the engine cutter's motor rapidly grew closer.]
 66: 1070| [47] [Kazami]
 67: 1073| [45] ["O-oh no!"]
 68: 1081| [47] [Watase]
 69: 1084| [45] ["Let's run for it!"]
 70: 1089| [45] [Watase and Kazami desperately broke off into a run through the passageway.]
 71: 1144| [45] [They looked around for a place to hide without stopping.]
 72: 1157| [45] [They fled into the Area 3 connecting passageway and closed the gate before Kazami chose to speak up in a frightened voice.]
 73: 1219| [47] [Kazami]
 74: 1222| [45] ["C-Captain... where do you think we should run to?"]
 75: 1230| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1233| [45] ["... We'll be screwed no matter what room we hide in now that Moribe's got that engine cutter. She'll just break down the doors."]
 77: 1259| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1262| [45] ["But we need to find a safe place to retreat to..."]
 79: 1270| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1273| [45] ["Yeah... if we keep running around with these kids on our backs, we're gonna get caught eventually...!"]
 81: 1286| [45] [Watase checked his watch. It read "2:48 PM".]
 82: 1291| [45] [There was just about 20 minutes left until the AD wore off.]
 83: 1297| [45] [Watase checked his watch. It read "2:51 PM".]
 84: 1302| [45] [There were just 15 minutes left until the AD wore off.]
 85: 1307| [45] [There was no doubt that everyone underground would be severely injured once that time came.]
 86: 1312| [45] [--A heavy silence hung in the air.]
 87: 1317| [45] [Kazami soon shattered it with a sad voice.]
 88: 1343| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1346| [45] ["... Why did things turn out this way...!?"]
 90: 1354| [47] [Kazami]
 91: 1357| [45] ["We're being chased by our squadmate and people we swore to rescue... and we have no place to run...!"]
 92: 1365| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1368| [45] ["We can't save anyone... not even ourselves...!"]
 94: 1373| [45] [That was the first time Watase had heard her sound so hopeless.]
 95: 1378| [45] [So much so that it nearly broke his heart just listening to her.]
 96: 1383| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1384| [45] [(Goddammit... So there's nothing we can do...!?)]
 98: 1389| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1390| [45] [(Would it be better just to give it all up...!?)]
100: 1395| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
101: 1400| [45] [An image flashed through his brain.]
102: 1520| [47] [???]
103: 1523| [45] ["Watase! You can't give up!"]
104: 1531| [47] [???]
105: 1534| [45] ["You have to keep fighting on and on until the bitter end--"]
106: 1542| [47] [???]
107: 1545| [45] ["If you wanna die, you can do that later!"]
108: 1646| [47] [Watase]
109: 1649| [45] ["!?"]
110: 1654| [45] [Watase gasped.]
111: 1659| [47] [Watase]
112: 1660| [45] [(What was that...?)]
113: 1665| [45] [Watase had no idea.]
114: 1670| [45] [It appeared to be one of his old memories-- a scene from his now forgotten past.]
115: 1675| [45] [Those words were nostalgic, sad, and comforting.]
116: 1680| [45] [They gave Watase the strength he needed.]
117: 1710| [47] [Watase]
118: 1713| [45] ["Tachibana... don't give up."]
119: 1718| [45] [Watase relayed those words to Kazami.]
120: 1726| [47] [Watase]
121: 1729| [45] ["We're still alive... and there's still people we need to save."]
122: 1737| [47] [Watase]
123: 1740| [45] ["So fight on until the bitter end..."]
124: 1748| [47] [Watase]
125: 1751| [45] ["If you wanna give up, you can do that later."]
126: 1756| [45] [Those words brought the silence between them back.]
127: 1761| [45] [All Watase could hear was the sound of Kazami breathing.]
128: 1766| [45] [But when they exited the connecting passageway...]
129: 1771| [45] [Kazami quietly spoke up.]
130: 1797| [47] [Kazami]
131: 1800| [45] ["... Yes."]
132: 1805| [45] [Her voice was brimming with the will of someone determined to escape from this despair.]
