  1:   50| [45] [Watase's team quickly went through Area 4 to begin searching LABO once more.]
  2:  198| [45] [But they failed to find either Salyu or Yuuri--]
  3:  257| [45] [--and ended up in Area 3.]
  4:  265| [47] [Watase]
  5:  268| [45] ["Is it just me, or is something burning?"]
  6:  330| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  333| [45] ["You're right... Where in the world is it coming from...?"]
  8:  440| [45] [As they traced the smell to its source, they found a fire burning in the emergency staircase.]
  9:  448| [47] [Watase]
 10:  451| [45] ["Was the fire not fully put out and it just relit?"]
 11:  477| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  480| [45] ["It appears that the sprinklers weren't able to put it out entirely because it was in the shadow of the staircase."]
 13:  532| [45] [Kazami went to take out a fire hose.]
 14:  614| [45] [Immediately afterwards, Watase found a fire extinguisher beside the fire--%Nand felt a sense of danger for some reason.]
 15:  619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  620| [45] [(Wh-what's this!?)]
 17:  667| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  670| [45] ["Captain, I've got the hos--"]
 19:  675| [45] [Kazami soon started to come back with the fire hose.]
 20:  689| [47] [Watase]
 21:  692| [45] ["Tachibana, stay back! Retreat!"]
 22:  719| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  722| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 24:  727| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  728| [45] [(???)]
 26:  733| [45] [In that moment, countless warning sirens blared away inside Watase's head--]
 27:  741| [47] [Watase]
 28:  744| [45] ["Look out!"]
 29: 1073| [47] [Kazami]
 30: 1076| [45] ["Ugh!"]
 31: 1084| [47] [Kazami]
 32: 1087| [45] ["... M-my leg..."]
 33: 1092| [45] [Kazami injured her leg!]
 34: 1097| [45] [Watase parted with Ukita and brought Kazami to the surveillance room.]
 35: 1145| [45] [--And after he treated Kazami, Watase chased after Ukita and resumed searching LABO.]
