  1:  177| [47] [Watase]
  2:  180| [45] ["!?"]
  3:  185| [45] [Watase and Kazami turned around in shock to find Ukita standing there.]
  4:  211| [47] [Ukita]
  5:  214| [45] ["Well well, if it isn't Captain Kasasagi and Lieutenant Tachibana."]
  6:  240| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  243| [45] ["I thought I heard noises coming from here. What might you two be up to?"]
  8:  248| [47] [Watase]
  9:  249| [45] [(Wh-what...?)]
 10:  254| [45] [Ukita's eyes were glazed over with instability.]
 11:  259| [45] [His gaze locked onto the two survivors resting in their respective beds.]
 12:  285| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  288| [45] ["Natsuhiko!? And Louise!?"]
 14:  296| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  299| [45] ["Dear Lord... How'd they get hurt so badly!? And where have they been this whole time...!?"]
 16:  304| [45] [Watase carefully chose his words as he answered.]
 17:  312| [47] [Watase]
 18:  315| [45] ["You see... I took the two of them into custody in Area N after I went there to try and put the fires out."]
 19:  341| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  344| [45] ["Did you just say... putting out the fires in Area N?"]
 21:  370| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  373| [45] ["I see... now I finally understand...!"]
 23:  381| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  384| [45] ["I knew it! You really are a traitor, through and through!"]
 25:  392| [47] [Watase]
 26:  395| [45] ["O-old man...?"]
 27:  400| [45] [He didn't understand why Ukita was angry.]
 28:  405| [45] [But Ukita ignored the bewilderment on Watase's face and continued talking in a subdued voice.]
 29:  431| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  434| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... I know you'll have trouble believing this, but I did trust you."]
 31:  442| [47] [Ukita]
 32:  445| [45] ["I truly believed you to be a man of justice..."]
 33:  471| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  474| [45] ["That's why I risked my life in my own way to save those girls. But then you...!"]
 35:  500| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  503| [45] ["You'll pay for this...!"]
 37:  508| [45] [Ukita grunted and reached into his breast pocket.]
 38:  513| [45] [He then pulled out-- a pistol.]
 39:  696| [47] [Watase]
 40:  699| [45] ["!?"]
 41:  704| [45] [It was the same pistol that Ena had given him.]
 42:  709| [45] [The one whose bullets and magazine had been removed and given to Jun and Ena for safekeeping, leaving Ukita with the gun itself. It should have been unloaded--]
 43:  717| [47] [Watase]
 44:  720| [45] ["Is this your idea of a bluff!? That thing's no better than a toy without a magazine, you know!?"]
 45:  728| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  731| [45] ["A bluff? Oh, so I guess you didn't know, did you?"]
 47:  739| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  742| [45] ["You can still fire a gun without a magazine so long as you have bullets.%NGranted, you do have to load and fire them one at a time."]
 49:  750| [47] [Watase]
 50:  753| [45] ["Where in the hell did you get bullets...!?"]
 51:  761| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  764| [45] ["Where indeed."]
 53:  769| [45] [Ukita's attitude made it clear that he apparently wasn't bluffing.]
 54:  777| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  780| [45] ["... Go ahead and laugh. I know it's fragile justice. But it's my choice."]
 56:  788| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  791| [45] ["If killing you means it'll put an end to all of this, then I'll do what I must."]
 58:  799| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  802| [45] ["Even if it means staining my hands in sin for the first and last time in my life...!"]
 60:  807| [45] [--Ukita's words made no sense. His face was clearly brimming with insanity.]
 61:  815| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  818| [45] ["M-Mr. Ukita...!"]
 63:  826| [47] [Watase]
 64:  829| [45] ["Wait, listen to me before you fire that thing!"]
 65:  837| [47] [Watase]
 66:  840| [45] ["Maybe you didn't know this, but there is no nuclear reactor in Area N!"]
 67:  848| [47] [Watase]
 68:  851| [45] ["So there was no need for us to be afraid of any radiation from the very beginning!"]
 69:  856| [45] [If it was Ukita's fear of radiation that had caused him to fall so far off the beaten track, then hearing that would likely bring him back to his senses.]
 70:  861| [45] [However--]
 71:  908| [47] [Ukita]
 72:  911| [45] ["You..."]
 73:  919| [47] [Ukita]
 74:  922| [45] ["You're still uttering such nonsense at this point...?"]
 75:  930| [47] [Watase]
 76:  933| [45] ["Believe me! It's the truth!"]
 77:  941| [47] [Ukita]
 78:  944| [45] ["Well, it matters not. Either way--"]
 79:  991| [47] [Ukita]
 80:  994| [45] ["--Your 'mission' ends here!"]
 81: 1002| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1005| [45] ["!?"]
 83: 1013| [47] [Ukita]
 84: 1016| [45] ["Die, traitor!"]
 85: 1021| [45] [Ukita pulled the trigger. Watase froze in terror.]
 86: 1026| [45] [--But right then...]
 87: 1106| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1109| [45] ["Captain! Look out!"]
 89: 1226| [45] [Ukita's bullet bore a hole in the wall behind Watase.]
 90: 1312| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1315| [45] ["Old man!"]
 92: 1320| [45] [Watase pulled his pistol out as Kazami grappled with Ukita.]
 93: 1346| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1349| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
 95: 1403| [45] [Ukita frantically turned around when he caught sight of the gun pointed straight at him.]
 96: 1408| [45] [Watase had a chance to shoot him in the back right there-- but he couldn't pull the trigger.]
 97: 1413| [45] [He didn't even know if there were any bullets left in that pistol.]
 98: 1418| [45] [Ukita ran right out of the door and out of sight.]
 99: 1423| [45] [The only trace of him left was his shouts coming from the hallway.]
100: 1549| [47] [Ukita]
101: 1552| [45] ["So you've shown your true colors at last, Captain Kasasagi!"]
102: 1560| [47] [Ukita]
103: 1563| [45] ["But I -will- ensure that you get your just deserts! Mark my words!"]
104: 1604| [45] [The sound of Ukita's footsteps disappeared in the direction of Area 4.]
105: 1650| [47] [Watase]
106: 1653| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell's gotten into him!?"]
107: 1658| [45] [There were some things suspicious about Watase, no question about it, but Ukita was taking things way too far.]
108: 1663| [45] [He then suddenly realized that Kazami was staring at the gun in his hands.]
109: 1725| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1728| [45] ["Captain... what are you doing with that pistol...?"]
111: 1736| [47] [Watase]
112: 1739| [45] ["Oh, right, forgot to mention."]
113: 1747| [47] [Watase]
114: 1750| [45] ["I found this lying next to Natsuhiko in Area N."]
115: 1776| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1779| [45] ["O-oh, I see..."]
117: 1784| [45] [It seemed she was scared of the pistol.]
118: 1789| [45] [Watase quickly put it back into his breast pocket and changed the subject.]
119: 1797| [47] [Watase]
120: 1800| [45] ["Anyway, we need to get out of here as quickly as possible."]
121: 1808| [47] [Watase]
122: 1811| [45] ["Now that the old man knows we're here, this place is no longer safe."]
123: 1816| [45] [Natsuhiko's transfusion was still in progress, and Salyu hadn't shown any signs of regaining consciousness.]
124: 1821| [45] [Their lives would be in danger if another fight broke out in the infirmary.]
125: 1829| [47] [Watase]
126: 1832| [45] ["... And Teach is in trouble too."]
127: 1858| [47] [Kazami]
128: 1861| [45] ["You mean Ms. Tsubakiyama? Now that I think about it, where is she?"]
129: 1869| [47] [Watase]
130: 1872| [45] ["I left her in an office in Area 2. It wouldn't be surprising if the old man attacked her too, given the way he was acting just now."]
131: 1880| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1883| [45] ["... Understood. Then let us rendezvous with Ms. Tsubakiyama while we continue Tenkawa's transfusion."]
133: 1888| [45] [Kazami attached the blood pack and transfusion kit to Natsuhiko's body.]
134: 1893| [45] [Watase then carried him, with Kazami doing the same for Salyu, as they all left the room.]
