  1:   34| [45] [The group split up and began searching the area--]
  2:   39| [45] [But then Jun spoke up.]
  3:   65| [47] [Jun]
  4:   68| [45] ["Hold on, Captain. Do you know where the room that was on fire is?"]
  5:   76| [47] [Watase]
  6:   79| [45] ["Yeah, it's that one further down over there. What about it?"]
  7:  105| [47] [Jun]
  8:  108| [45] ["Do you mind helping me search it? I want to play it safe just in case something happens."]
  9:  113| [45] [Watase could feel a slight hint of nervousness in Jun's voice.]
 10:  189| [47] [Watase]
 11:  190| [45] [(Well, it hasn't been that long since she fainted...)]
 12:  195| [45] [No, maybe the reason she was trying to be so proactive was in order to get rid of the fear she still felt from that incident.]
 13:  229| [45] [Once he realized what she was thinking, Watase nodded.]
 14:  237| [47] [Watase]
 15:  240| [45] ["Sure. But be careful. There might still be some gas here."]
 16:  266| [47] [Jun]
 17:  269| [45] ["Roger!"]
 18:  274| [45] [Watase and Jun fired themselves up and went into the room.]
 19:  382| [45] [It had completely burned to a crisp.]
 20:  387| [45] [Jun looked around the scorched room and quietly spoke.]
 21:  450| [47] [Jun]
 22:  453| [45] ["Looks like the fire's been completely put out, but still..."]
 23:  461| [47] [Watase]
 24:  464| [45] ["Any card that was in here must have been burned to ashes."]
 25:  469| [45] [Watase was about to leave the room, but spotted some documents at his feet before he could.]
 26:  474| [45] [They were sopping wet from the sprinkler's extinguishing agents, so the letters were blurred-- but he could still read the word "Disaster" on the front.]
 27:  482| [47] [Watase]
 28:  485| [45] ["Hmm... what's this?"]
 29:  511| [47] [Jun]
 30:  514| [45] ["Let me see."]
 31:  519| [45] [Watase and Jun picked it up and drew their heads close so they could look over it together.]
 32:  557| [45] ["LABO Fire Incident" July 10th, 2021]
 33:  560| [85] [　]
 34:  563| [45] [All relevant parties are most likely already aware of the fire that occurred in this facility three days ago (July 7, 2021).]
 35:  566| [45] [Although the worst possible outcome was averted at the last moment, there were inadequacies found in multiple sec--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 36:  569| [45] [This document contains a compilation of the problems hinted at by this incident.]
 37:  572| [45] [The cause of the fire--[text too blurred to make out]--of Senior Fellow S.]
 38:  575| [45] [S had been appointed as an administrator of--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 39:  578| [45] [As a result, he had quite a great number of opportunities to come into contact with the research results--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 40:  582| [45] [And about three months later, S co--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 41:  585| [45] [He took the power generator gasoline stored--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 42:  588| [45] [--[text too blurred to make out]--set them all on fire and intentionally caused the--[text too blurred to make out]--]

 46:  600| [45] [Furthermore, these research results--[text too blurred to make out]--designated as "N" amongst--[text too blurred to make out]--]
 47:  604| [45] [Also, while this is not directly--[text too blurred to make out]--%Ntwo children infiltrated the facility on the day of the incident at a most unfortunate time.]
 48:  607| [45] [--[text too blurred to make out]--for children to have found and exploited a hole in our security.]
 49:  610| [45] [This is quite frankly the epitome of carelessness for our security systems.]
 50:  613| [45] [And two lives were lost as a result.]
 51:  616| [45] [We must all learn a lesson from this incident.]
 52:  619| [45] [Strengthening--[text too blurred to make out]--y alone doesn't guarantee us any safety whatsoever.]
 53:  622| [45] [There is an urgent need to have the specifications of a Case N reviewed and for the security systems to be enhanced.]
 54:  625| [45] [Otherwise, we may foresee yet another repeat of this tragedy.]
 55:  628| [85] [　]
 56:  631| [45] [--[text too blurred to make out]--mic and Biological Organization Security Chief Isao Kawada--]
 57:  657| [45] [--It appeared to be a record regarding a fire that'd happened in this facility in the past.]
 58:  683| [47] [Jun]
 59:  686| [45] ["2021..."]
 60:  691| [45] [Jun muttered that in a grim voice.]
 61:  699| [47] [Watase]
 62:  702| [45] ["Yeah... if I'm not mistaken, it's 2030 now, right?"]
 63:  728| [47] [Jun]
 64:  731| [45] ["Yeah. That was nine years ago, huh?"]
 65:  739| [47] [Watase]
 66:  742| [45] ["Do you remember that fire at all?"]
 67:  768| [47] [Jun]
 68:  771| [45] ["Well, I was in elementary school at the time... but yeah, I vaguely remember hearing about it."]
 69:  779| [47] [Jun]
 70:  782| [45] ["I think a kid died. But it was the uproar that happened -after- the fire rather than the fire itself that was more memorable."]
 71:  790| [47] [Watase]
 72:  793| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 73:  819| [47] [Jun]
 74:  822| [45] ["That kid was taken to the hospital afterwards and died... but there were all these scandalous stories about it at first."]
 75:  830| [47] [Jun]
 76:  833| [45] ["Stuff like 'the kid died of radiation exposure' or 'the fire caused a radiation leak'."]
 77:  841| [47] [Watase]
 78:  844| [45] ["What...!?"]
 79:  870| [47] [Jun]
 80:  873| [45] ["Well, it was only a few people who made such a big fuss out of it, and the stories were soon dismissed as rumors... but the part about the kid dying is true."]
 81:  881| [47] [Watase]
 82:  884| [45] ["... That sure isn't easy to think about..."]
 83:  910| [47] [Jun]
 84:  913| [45] ["Yeah... 2021 was a real bad year."]
 85:  918| [45] [Jun looked back at the report.]
 86:  944| [47] [Jun]
 87:  947| [45] ["The fact that they said 'the worst possible outcome was averted' means that a Case N probably didn't happen back then..."]
 88:  955| [47] [Watase]
 89:  958| [45] ["The 'disaster' did end up repeating itself anyway...!"]
 90:  963| [45] [Watase and Jun's voices were tinged with bitterness.]
 91:  968| [45] [The security systems must never have been enhanced.]
 92:  976| [47] [Watase]
 93:  979| [45] ["Tch... then let's make sure that there's at least no more victims this time around."]
 94: 1005| [47] [Jun]
 95: 1008| [45] ["Damn straight. We'll save everyone and get the hell out of here."]
 96: 1013| [45] [Watase and Jun nodded at each other and left the room.]
