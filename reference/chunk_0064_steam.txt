  1:   61| [45] [--Area 1, inner ring, B2.]
  2:   66| [45] [They had returned to the place where Watase had first woken up.]
  3:   71| [45] [They split up again and searched the floor, but--]
  4:  133| [47] [Jun]
  5:  136| [45] ["Nothing of value on this floor either, huh?"]
  6:  144| [47] [Watase]
  7:  147| [45] ["Then let's head down to B1 this ti..."]
  8:  153| [45] [Watase suddenly picked up a faint sound before he could finish.]
  9:  161| [47] [Watase]
 10:  164| [45] ["...?"]
 11:  191| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  194| [45] ["Hmm? Is something the matter?"]
 13:  202| [47] [Watase]
 14:  205| [45] ["No... I just thought I heard someone's footsteps or something..."]
 15:  252| [47] [Jun]
 16:  255| [45] ["Huh!? From where!?"]
 17:  260| [45] [Watase tried to make out where he'd heard the footsteps.]
 18:  268| [47] [Watase]
 19:  271| [45] ["I can't be sure about this... but I think they came from the stairwell...!"]
 20:  297| [47] [Jun]
 21:  300| [45] ["Think it's one of the survivors!?"]
 22:  326| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  329| [45] ["No, it could be Ms. Tachibana and Ms. Tsubakiyama for all we know."]
 24:  337| [47] [Watase]
 25:  340| [45] ["I dunno, but we'd better take a look!"]
 26:  345| [45] [The team ran for the stairwell in high spirits.]
 27:  395| [45] [But there was no sign of anyone there.]
 28:  400| [45] [The fireproof door on B1 was wide open. The room was dimly illuminated by the light leaking in through that opening.]
 29:  405| [45] [There was no one to be found at the top of the stairs or behind the shadows of the staircase.]
 30:  438| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  441| [45] ["... No one's here?"]
 32:  449| [47] [Watase]
 33:  452| [45] ["Mmm, maybe I was just imagining things."]
 34:  485| [47] [Jun]
 35:  488| [45] ["You don't know that for sure. Maybe they went up."]
 36:  493| [45] [The team ascended the staircase as they talked, with Watase in the front, Ukita in the middle, and Jun in the back.]
 37:  499| [45] [But at that moment--]
 38:  504| [45] [They heard a sound cutting through the air above them.]
 39:  590| [47] [Watase]
 40:  593| [45] ["!?"]
 41:  598| [45] [Watase looked up in surprise.]
 42:  603| [45] [He then saw something falling down from the top of the stairw-]
 43:  661| [47] [Jun]
 44:  664| [45] ["Captain, look out!!"]
 45:  669| [45] [Jun screamed.]
 46:  698| [47] [Watase]
 47:  701| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 48:  706| [45] [Watase suddenly felt someone shove him from behind, causing him to fall forward.]
 49:  749| [45] [And merely a second later, he heard a heavy thud coming from the rear!]
 50:  775| [47] [Jun]
 51:  778| [45] ["Kah... agh!"]
 52:  798| [45] [Watase turned around in shock to see a mysterious object hit Jun's back.]
 53:  803| [45] [It was a cluster of concrete with several thin reinforcing bars sticking out of it.]
 54:  808| [45] [Jun then staggered--]
 55:  816| [47] [Watase]
 56:  819| [45] ["Ah!"]
 57:  824| [45] [Watase tried to grab her, but it was too late.]
 58:  838| [47] [Jun]
 59:  841| [45] ["--!!"]
 60:  846| [45] [Jun fell down the stairs, only stopping at B2's landing.]
 61:  854| [47] [Watase]
 62:  857| [45] ["Mo... Moribe!"]
 63:  890| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  893| [45] ["A-are you all right!?"]
 65:  947| [45] [Watase and Ukita hurried down the stairs, their faces pale.]
 66:  996| [47] [Jun]
 67:  999| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 68: 1004| [45] [Jun groaned faintly. She had apparently lost consciousness.]
 69: 1009| [45] [Watase checked her, and soon found blood oozing from her back.]
 70: 1014| [45] [She'd been impaled on one of the reinforcing bars from the debris.]
 71: 1022| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1025| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell just happened!?"]
 73: 1030| [45] [Watase looked upstairs.]
 74: 1035| [45] [But with all the darkness filling the stairwell, he couldn't spot anyone.]
 75: 1040| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1041| [45] [(Did the ceiling collapse again!?)]
 77: 1049| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1052| [45] ["It's too dangerous here, old man! Let's get Moribe to a safe place for now!"]
 79: 1078| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1081| [45] ["G-got it!"]
 81: 1086| [45] [Watase carried Jun on his back and ran out the stairwell.]
