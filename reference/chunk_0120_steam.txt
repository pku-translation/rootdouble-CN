  1:   62| [45] [--Watase stood there in a daze for a while.]
  2:   67| [45] [He eventually came back to his senses, only to have the weight of the life he had just lost crush him once more.]
  3:   72| [47] [Watase]
  4:   73| [45] [(... Goddammit.)]
  5:   78| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth as he stood in front of that sealed room.]
  6:   83| [47] [Watase]
  7:   84| [45] [(Why am I so damn powerless...!?)]
  8:   89| [47] [Watase]
  9:   90| [45] [(If only I were my true self with all his memories... then I just know I would have saved Teach for sure...!)]
 10:   95| [45] [He had no AD. His time limit grew shorter with each passing moment.]
 11:  100| [45] [Even if he started searching now, he had but a slim chance of finding more AD, and he knew that.]
 12:  105| [45] [He couldn't find an exit, he'd lost the trust of his comrades-- and to top it all off, even Ena had been killed.]
 13:  110| [47] [Watase]
 14:  111| [45] [(... Is this the end of the line...?)]
 15:  116| [47] [Watase]
 16:  117| [45] [(Would it be better to just give it all up and call it quits...?)]
 17:  122| [45] [Watase was assailed by his powerlessness.]
 18:  127| [45] [His heart felt as if it would sink into darkness at any moment.]
 19:  132| [47] [Watase]
 20:  133| [45] [(So in the end... I can't save anyone the way I am now...?)]
 21:  138| [45] [But at that moment--]
 22:  276| [45] [He remembered something the commander had said in one of his transmissions.]
 23:  281| [47] [Commander]
 24:  284| [45] ["It seems that due to the meltdown, there's still a huge fire going on in Area N, which is where the reactor is located--"]
 25:  289| [47] [Commander]
 26:  292| [45] ["The security's system's gone haywire thanks to that, which means that we can no longer access it externally in theory."]
 27:  357| [47] [Watase]
 28:  358| [45] [(...!)]
 29:  363| [47] [Watase]
 30:  364| [45] [(I get it... so if we could just put out the fires in Area N...!)]
 31:  369| [47] [Watase]
 32:  370| [45] [(Then the security system would stabilize, the lockdown would lift, and we could all get out of here safe and sound!)]
 33:  375| [45] [But there was a melted down nuclear reactor in Area N.]
 34:  380| [45] [That place was filled to the brim with radiation. Once he went in, he was most likely never coming out.]
 35:  385| [47] [Watase]
 36:  386| [45] [(... Ha, so what?)]
 37:  391| [45] [He'd have been lying if he said he wasn't scared.]
 38:  396| [45] [But Watase no longer valued his own life at all.]
 39:  401| [45] [--He would end this nightmare as soon as possible and ensure that at least one person escaped to the surface.]
 40:  406| [45] [That was the only way he could atone for letting Ena die.]
 41:  469| [47] [Ena]
 42:  472| [45] ["... You fool. What good's that going to do?"]
 43:  483| [45] [Watase heard Ena's voice scolding him in his head.]
 44:  491| [47] [Watase]
 45:  494| [45] ["Sorry, Teach... but this is the only course of action I have left..."]
 46:  499| [45] [Watase muttered that and walked off.]
 47:  504| [45] [He headed for Area N, home of the burning reactor--]
 48:  611| [45] [Watase's Procyon started beeping louder than he'd ever heard it before when he opened the connecting passageway gate to Area N.]
 49:  616| [45] [The Procyon's display was giving off a reading far greater than he'd ever seen before.]
 50:  622| [47] [Watase]
 51:  625| [45] ["'11850 mSv'...!"]
 52:  631| [47] [Watase]
 53:  634| [45] ["'11750 mSv'...!"]
 54:  640| [47] [Watase]
 55:  643| [45] ["'11650 mSv'...!"]
 56:  649| [47] [Watase]
 57:  652| [45] ["'11550 mSv'...!"]
 58:  658| [47] [Watase]
 59:  661| [45] ["'11450 mSv'...!"]
 60:  666| [45] [He was then assaulted by an intense headache and severe nausea.]
 61:  671| [45] [His skin was numb, and his vision grew blurry.]
 62:  679| [47] [Watase]
 63:  682| [45] ["... Tch."]
 64:  726| [45] [Watase turned his Procyon off, then kept on walking.]
 65:  769| [47] [Watase]
 66:  770| [45] [(The nuclear reactor's right behind this gate...!)]
 67:  775| [45] [A melted down reactor, raging hellfire, and extremely lethal doses of radiation--]
 68:  780| [45] [Watase shuddered as he imagined that hell on Earth waiting for him right up ahead.]
 69:  785| [45] [But...]
 70:  793| [47] [Watase]
 71:  796| [45] ["... I'm ready."]
 72:  801| [45] [Watase kept himself from shaking, then pulled a hose out from the nearby fire hydrant.]
 73:  806| [45] [He held it with his left hand, with the security card in the right.]
 74:  811| [47] [Watase]
 75:  812| [45] [(Extinguishing preparations all set. Let's roll.)]
 76:  817| [45] [Though genuine danger lay just up ahead, Watase did not falter.]
 77:  822| [45] [Grim determination was coursing through him.]
 78:  827| [45] [He suddenly broke out into a smile.]
 79:  832| [47] [Watase]
 80:  833| [45] [(... Teach... perhaps I've finally become... a true rescue worker.)]
 81:  838| [45] [He then took the card in his hand--]
 82:  905| [45] [And opened the gate.]
