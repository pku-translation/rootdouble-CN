  0:   76| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
  1:   84| [45] [Yet he tried to say something-- but then...]
  2:  110| [47] [Kazami]
  3:  113| [45] ["... Captain, did you really lose your memory?"]
  4:  121| [47] [Watase]
  5:  124| [45] ["Tachibana...!?"]
  6:  150| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  153| [45] ["I apologize for asking this, but like Moribe says, your actions are far too incomprehensible."]
  8:  161| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  164| [45] ["You claim that you went down to the basement because you were summoned by Dojima and Hiyama--"]
 10:  172| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  175| [45] ["But normally, you would have contacted me and Moribe and ordered us to go instead."]
 12:  201| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  204| [45] ["Yet that is not what you did."]
 14:  212| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  215| [45] ["Please answer this question: why did you leave the command post and go down to the basement by yourself?"]
 16:  220| [45] [The calculating look in Kazami's eyes pierced Watase's heart.]
 17:  228| [47] [Watase]
 18:  231| [45] ["W-well..."]
 19:  236| [45] [Watase desperately tried to remember in detail what the situation had been back then.]
 20:  241| [45] [But he didn't know anything. His memories of that time were completely gone.]
 21:  246| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  247| [45] ["..."]
 23:  273| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  276| [45] ["... Can you... not answer?"]
 25:  284| [47] [Watase]
 26:  287| [45] ["S-sorry..."]
 27:  313| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  316| [45] ["... Understood."]
 29:  339| [45] [Kazami breathed a heavy sigh, then signaled at Moribe with a glance and spoke.]
 30:  347| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  350| [45] ["Moribe, please get a rope or a wire or something like that.%NWe're going to restrain the Captain."]
 32:  358| [47] [Watase]
 33:  361| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 34:  366| [45] [Restrain?]
 35:  371| [45] [Watase didn't understand the meaning of that phrase for a moment.]
 36:  376| [45] [But that moment was long enough for Jun to pull out a cable lying under the control panel.]
 37:  418| [47] [Jun]
 38:  421| [45] ["... Mr. Ukita, can we use this?"]
 39:  429| [47] [Ukita]
 40:  432| [45] ["Yes, I don't mind in this case."]
 41:  437| [45] [Jun then cut the cable loose with her army knife once she'd received Ukita's consent.]
 42:  442| [45] [Said cable was more than long enough to tie someone up.]
 43:  447| [47] [Watase]
 44:  448| [45] [(... Don't tell me they're...!)]
 45:  456| [47] [Watase]
 46:  459| [45] ["A-are you kidding me...?"]
 47:  464| [45] [Kazami then looked at Watase with a cold look in her eyes and spoke.]
 48:  490| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  493| [45] ["We have no idea what could happen in this situation, and your existence is completely disrupting what little order we have here."]
 50:  501| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  504| [45] ["Therefore, we have to restrain you until you're clear of all suspicion."]
 52:  553| [45] [--They then restrained Watase's body with the cable, tied his hands behind his back, and brought him to a laboratory on B2 of Area 2's outer ring.]
 53:  631| [45] [Kazami looked Watase dead in the eye and spoke.]
 54:  640| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  643| [45] ["... I'll leave my last AD here for you. You should still be able to administer it to yourself in that pose, yes?"]
 56:  649| [45] [Kazami then placed her AD on the floor as if saying that it was the least she could do.]
 57:  654| [45] [Watase's hands were tied behind his back, but he probably could indeed still inject himself with it.]
 58:  659| [45] [But that didn't matter in the slightest to him.]
 59:  668| [47] [Watase]
 60:  671| [45] ["Tachibana... are you sure you're really okay with this?"]
 61:  676| [45] [Watase looked into Kazami's eyes with a heartfelt yet pleading gaze.]
 62:  702| [47] [Kazami]
 63:  705| [45] ["Captain, please don't look at me like that..."]
 64:  713| [47] [Kazami]
 65:  716| [45] ["If we find anything that clears you of suspicion, then I swear I'll come untie you right away, so please..."]
 66:  749| [45] [Kazami said that, then left the laboratory as if she were running away from him.]
 67:  754| [45] [The other members soon followed suit--]
 68:  810| [47] [Ukita]
 69:  813| [45] ["Just sit as still as you can until the lockdown ends."]
 70:  821| [47] [Jun]
 71:  824| [45] ["Captain, don't get any funny ideas, okay? I don't want to do anything worse than this to you."]
 72:  832| [47] [Ena]
 73:  835| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi... I'm sorry."]
 74:  941| [45] [--and left Watase alone in the laboratory.]
 75:  949| [47] [Watase]
 76:  952| [45] ["... Goddammit...!"]
 77:  957| [45] [He instinctively cursed.]
 78:  962| [45] [To be abandoned by the comrades he'd been through thick and thin with felt like being cut off from the world itself.]
 79:  967| [45] [But he could understand why they were nervous.]
 80:  972| [45] [The fact was that his actions before he'd lost his memories truly were simply too unnatural.]
 81:  977| [45] [The incident with Yuuri in particular had been fatal.]
 82: 1071| [47] [Kazami]
 83: 1074| [45] ["... Captain, did you really lose your memory?"]
 84: 1134| [45] [Kazami's cold glare was still burned into his brain.]
 85: 1139| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1140| [45] [(But... what was I supposed to have done...?)]
 87: 1145| [45] [He didn't have an answer to that.]
 88: 1150| [45] [And so time flew by as Watase kept pondering questions like that for a while--]
 89: 1207| [45] [--About an hour had passed.]
 90: 1212| [45] [It was time to take the AD again, but Kazami and the others hadn't come back.]
 91: 1217| [47] [Automatic PA]
 92: 1220| [45] ["--Main and backup power supplies offline."]
 93: 1225| [47] [Automatic PA]
 94: 1228| [45] ["Now switching to emergency power."]
 95: 1233| [45] [Just then, the lights suddenly went out with that announcement, leaving Watase in darkness and confused.]
 96: 1244| [45] [What in the world was happening outside...?]
 97: 1294| [45] [--Two hours passed.]
 98: 1299| [45] [Watase had already thrown up several times, likely due to the effects of radiation exposure.]
 99: 1311| [45] [--An hour passed.]
100: 1316| [45] [Watase had yet to use the AD that'd been left for him, both so that the survivors could use it and so he could prove his innocence.]
101: 1321| [47] [Automatic PA]
102: 1324| [45] ["--Main and backup power supplies offline."]
103: 1329| [47] [Automatic PA]
104: 1332| [45] ["Now switching to emergency power."]
105: 1337| [45] [Just then, the lights suddenly went out with that announcement, leaving Watase in darkness and confused.]
106: 1348| [45] [What in the world was happening outside...?]
107: 1398| [45] [--Two hours passed.]
108: 1403| [45] [Watase had already thrown up twice, likely due to the effects of radiation exposure.]
109: 1409| [45] [Yet his nausea just wouldn't go away, and his headaches and the numbness in his skin only grew worse with time.]
110: 1414| [47] [Watase]
111: 1415| [45] [(Dammit... enough is enough...)]
112: 1421| [45] [Without the willpower to speak, Watase had to settle for cursing in his head--]
113: 1440| [45] [Watase felt goosebumps spread all over his body at that sound.]
114: 1451| [47] [Watase]
115: 1452| [45] [(Were those-- gunshots!?)]
116: 1457| [47] [Watase]
117: 1458| [45] [(What happened!? What's going on out there!?)]
118: 1463| [45] [Anxiety swiftly filled Watase's heart.]
119: 1471| [47] [Watase]
120: 1474| [45] ["Hey, is anyone around!? Get me out of here, please!"]
121: 1479| [45] [Watase started shouting outside as his panic grew worse and worse.]
122: 1484| [45] [Soon enough--]
123: 1537| [45] [--Jun opened the door.]
124: 1563| [47] [Jun]
125: 1566| [45] ["Captain..."]
126: 1571| [45] [She staggered into the room on unsteady feet.]
127: 1579| [47] [Watase]
128: 1582| [45] ["Moribe, what happened!? I thought I heard gunshots!"]
129: 1648| [47] [Jun]
130: 1649| [45] ["..."]
131: 1660| [45] [But Jun cut Watase's bonds with her army knife without another word.]
132: 1665| [45] [Her face was unbelievably pale.]
133: 1670| [45] [Her pained breaths made it even clearer that she wasn't her normal self.]
134: 1678| [47] [Watase]
135: 1681| [45] ["M-Moribe...?"]
136: 1686| [45] [Watase called out to her in worry--]
137: 1712| [47] [Jun]
138: 1715| [45] ["Ugh..."]
139: 1766| [45] [--only for Jun to pitch forward. Watase immediately caught her.]
140: 1774| [47] [Watase]
141: 1777| [45] ["H-hey!"]
142: 1782| [45] [His palms were damp with something sticky.]
143: 1858| [45] [It was blood-- lots and lots of blood.]
144: 1863| [45] [Watase then noticed that Jun's back was being stained red by a large cut that was ripping right through it.]
145: 1875| [47] [Watase]
146: 1878| [45] ["Moribe... how...!?"]
147: 1886| [47] [Jun]
148: 1889| [45] ["... Cap... tain... run... for it..."]
149: 1897| [47] [Jun]
150: 1900| [45] ["... She... she's..."]
151: 1905| [45] [Jun wheezed out a breath before she could say any more.]
152: 1910| [45] [And with that, she stopped moving altogether.]
153: 1918| [47] [Watase]
154: 1921| [45] ["M-Moribe...?"]
155: 1926| [45] [She didn't respond to him.]
156: 1931| [45] [He could tell Jun's body was losing heat and fast.]
157: 1939| [47] [Watase]
158: 1942| [45] ["Moribe! Hang in there, you hear me!? Moribe!"]
159: 1947| [45] [But Jun didn't move.]
160: 1955| [47] [Watase]
161: 1958| [45] ["N-no way... If this is a bad joke, then cut it out!"]
162: 1963| [45] [Watase silently prayed as he checked Jun's Vital Checker.]
163: 2060| [45] [--All red.]
164: 2065| [45] [That signified "death".]
165: 2089| [47] [Watase]
166: 2092| [45] ["Moribe... no..."]
167: 2100| [47] [Watase]
168: 2103| [45] ["Why...?"]
169: 2111| [47] [Watase]
170: 2114| [45] ["Why did this happen...?"]
171: 2122| [47] [Watase]
172: 2125| [45] ["Moribe..."]
173: 2130| [47] [Watase]
174: 2131| [45] ["..."]
175: 2136| [47] [Watase]
176: 2137| [45] ["..."]
177: 2142| [47] [Watase]
178: 2143| [45] ["..."]
179: 2151| [47] [Watase]
180: 2154| [45] ["... Dammit..."]
181: 2162| [47] [Watase]
182: 2165| [45] ["--DAMMIT! Who the hell did this to Moribe!?"]
183: 2216| [45] [Watase ran out the room, desperate for answers.]
184: 2221| [47] [Watase]
185: 2222| [45] [(--What happened here!?)]
186: 2227| [47] [Watase]
187: 2228| [45] [(What in the world has been happening in LABO while I've been locked up!?)]
188: 2277| [45] [He then randomly ran around and eventually ended up in a connecting passageway--]
189: 2282| [45] [Only to find Ukita sitting against the well.]
190: 2287| [45] [Watase had a bad feeling about the situation.]
191: 2292| [45] [He could see a pool of blood spreading in front of Ukita.]
192: 2300| [47] [Watase]
193: 2303| [45] ["--Old man!"]
194: 2308| [45] [Watase ran up to Ukita and touched his shoulder.]
195: 2313| [45] [When he did, Ukita's body fell to the ground sideways without offering the slightest resistance--]
196: 2324| [45] [There was a giant, deep cut stretching from his right shoulder all the way to his heart.]
197: 2332| [47] [Watase]
198: 2335| [45] ["Old man! Hey! Hang in there!"]
199: 2340| [45] [But Ukita didn't answer--]
200: 2345| [45] [Watase just then noticed that there was something in Ukita's hand.]
201: 2445| [47] [Watase]
202: 2448| [45] ["Wha!? What was the old man doing with something like this!?"]
203: 2453| [45] [The pistol in Ukita's hand was a totally different model from the one Ena had given him.]
204: 2474| [45] [Watase looked around to find there were bullet marks in the nearby walls and floor.]
205: 2482| [47] [Watase]
206: 2485| [45] ["Then that gunfire I heard was--!?"]
207: 2490| [45] [Ukita had probably been trying to fight off someone with that pistol.]
208: 2495| [45] [But he had been no match for them.]
209: 2500| [45] [He had been slain in one mere strike.]
210: 2505| [45] [And his wound looked identical to the one on Jun's back.]
211: 2510| [47] [Watase]
212: 2511| [45] [(Which means that the old man fought their attacker here to give Jun time to escape!?)]
213: 2516| [47] [Watase]
214: 2517| [45] [(But even though he was no expert with guns, who could have avoided all the old man's shots and killed him like this...!?)]
215: 2522| [47] [Watase]
216: 2523| [45] [(--No way!)]
217: 2528| [45] [Several scenes of all the death Watase had seen in this place went through his head.]
218: 2816| [47] [Watase]
219: 2817| [45] [(Is the one who killed those five now on the move!?)]
220: 2822| [45] [Then the fact that the same killer had murdered Ukita and Jun meant--]
221: 2827| [47] [Watase]
222: 2828| [45] [(Shit! Are they trying to kill us all!?)]
223: 2833| [45] [Watase then gasped as it finally hit him.]
224: 2841| [47] [Watase]
225: 2844| [45] ["--Then that means Tachibana and Teach are in trouble!"]
226: 2849| [45] [Watase left Ukita's corpse behind and ran through the connecting passageway.]
227: 2904| [45] [But what he found waiting for him was--]
228: 2914| [47] [Watase]
229: 2917| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
230: 2922| [45] [Watase was immediately rendered speechless when he arrived at the inner ring.]
231: 2966| [45] [The whole floor was covered in spreading blood-- .]
232: 2971| [45] [Kazami was lying face up right in the middle of it.]
233: 2989| [47] [Watase]
234: 2992| [45] ["--Tachibana!?"]
235: 2997| [45] [Watase ran up to her and held her in his arms.]
236: 3002| [45] [There was a large vertical cut across Kazami's chest.]
237: 3007| [45] [The same kind of cut that Jun and Ukita had.]
238: 3012| [45] [Rivets of still warm blood poured out of it.]
239: 3145| [47] [Kazami]
240: 3148| [45] ["... Wa... Watase...?"]
241: 3153| [45] [Kazami was still breathing faintly.]
242: 3161| [47] [Watase]
243: 3164| [45] ["Tachibana! Just hold on, I'll treat you right away!"]
244: 3169| [45] [But Kazami kept talking deliriously as if she didn't hear a word Watase said.]
245: 3177| [47] [Kazami]
246: 3180| [45] ["Wata... se... I'm... sorry..."]
247: 3188| [47] [Kazami]
248: 3191| [45] ["If only... I'd... trusted... you... more..."]
249: 3196| [45] [Kazami's life grew fainter with each word.]
250: 3204| [47] [Watase]
251: 3207| [45] ["Tachibana, that's enough! It's okay, just save your breath!"]
252: 3215| [47] [Kazami]
253: 3218| [45] ["Aah... I can't see..."]
254: 3226| [47] [Kazami]
255: 3229| [45] ["Hey... where are you...?"]
256: 3237| [47] [Kazami]
257: 3240| [45] ["N-no... I don't... want to be alone... any... more..."]
258: 3245| [45] [It seemed Kazami's eyesight was rapidly failing.]
259: 3253| [47] [Watase]
260: 3256| [45] ["Tachibana! I'm here! I'm right here!"]
261: 3261| [45] [Watase looked into Kazami's eyes as he desperately called out to her.]
262: 3306| [45] [But she just looked up at the ceiling meaninglessly--]
263: 3311| [45] [And then, all of a sudden, something shined in her eyes.]
264: 3316| [47] [Watase]
265: 3317| [45] [(Is that something silver...?)]
266: 3322| [45] [At the very moment Watase realized that...]
267: 3491| [47] [Watase]
268: 3494| [45] ["!!!???"]
269: 3499| [45] [Something smashed right into the top of Watase's head, making his entire world shake.]
270: 3504| [45] [--A second later, his brain went haywire.]
271: 3509| [47] [Watase]
272: 3510| [45] [(Split  head's been)]
273: 3515| [45] [Split]
274: 3520| [45] [(brain's been) brain's been]
275: 3525| [45] [BRAIN's been]
276: 3530| [45] [--sPLiT!]
277: 3538| [47] [Watase]
278: 3541| [45] ["AGH, AAAAGH, GAAAAAAGHHHHHHH..."]
279: 3546| [45] [Strange sounds came out of his mouth.]
280: 3551| [45] [Just then, something was ripped out of his brain and let out a sound as it hit the ground.]
281: 3556| [45] [At that moment--]
282: 3748| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
283: 3749| [47] [--Fought? I-- a child-- ... high schooler?]
284: 3781| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
285: 3782| [85] [--Fought? I-- a child-- ... high schooler?]
286: 3811| [45] [A memory forgotten flew right past him.]
287: 4003| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
288: 4004| [47] [--Shot... at-- ... (her) him...-- with a gun-- ...?]

290: 4037| [85] [--Shot... at-- ... (her) him...-- with a gun-- ...?]
291: 4066| [45] [He didn't know when it was from.]
