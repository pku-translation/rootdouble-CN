  1:   61| [45] [--When Watase ran down the emergency staircase,]
  2:  173| [45] [he found the sea of flames still there.]
  3:  178| [45] [He could see Kazami and Jun holding two hoses as they desperately suppressed the fire,%Nthe sound of the Procyon's alarm beeping in the background.]
  4:  213| [47] [Jun]
  5:  216| [45] ["Oh, you came back!?"]
  6:  257| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  260| [45] ["Captain! Are you sure you're okay!?"]
  8:  268| [47] [Watase]
  9:  271| [45] ["Your concern is unnecessary! Anyway, is there anything I can help with!?"]
 10:  343| [47] [Jun]
 11:  346| [45] ["I'd like you to help us put out the fire, but, well--"]
 12:  351| [45] [Watase checked the area around him as he listened to Jun.]
 13:  362| [45] [Everywhere except for where Kazami and Jun were standing was engulfed in flames.]
 14:  367| [45] [With the air full of heat waves and steam, every breath he took felt like it was setting his lungs on fire.]
 15:  393| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  396| [45] ["It's too dangerous for you in your current condition! Please fall back!"]
 17:  411| [47] [Watase]
 18:  412| [45] [(No, "firefighting is all about teamwork"! There must be something that I can do too!)]
 19:  417| [45] [Watase stood frozen in place.]
 20:  471| [45] [He hesitated for a second, wondering if he should just do as Kazami said and fall back--]
 21:  476| [47] [Watase]
 22:  477| [45] [(No, "firefighting is all about teamwork"!)]
 23:  491| [47] [Watase]
 24:  492| [45] [(There must be something I can do too!)]
 25:  497| [45] [Watase stood frozen in place.]
 26:  511| [47] [Watase]
 27:  514| [45] ["I'll watch the fire from the rear! That way, I can let you know if I see something strange!"]
 28:  540| [47] [Jun]
 29:  543| [45] ["Yes, thank you, Captain!"]
 30:  569| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  572| [45] ["Much obliged!"]
 32:  636| [45] [The two of them shouted that and continued hosing down the fire.]
 33:  641| [47] [Watase]
 34:  642| [45] [(But this fire looks far beyond the control of human hands at this point...!)]
 35:  647| [45] [Just as Watase thought that--]
 36:  781| [45] [Some of the nearby flames surged upward fiercely.]
 37:  789| [47] [Watase]
 38:  792| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 39:  797| [45] [A tongue of flame which had been licking at the ceiling nimbly waved towards the floor.]
 40:  802| [45] [It was almost like the writhing of a giant snake--]
 41:  816| [47] [Watase]
 42:  819| [45] ["H-hey guys, what's that!?"]
 43:  868| [47] [Jun]
 44:  871| [45] ["!? Oh shit, it's rolling over!"]
 45:  928| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  931| [45] ["We'll never last against that! All hands retreat!"]
 47:  936| [45] [Even Watase could tell that whatever was happening was no laughing matter.]
 48:  944| [47] [Watase]
 49:  947| [45] ["T-this way, guys!"]
 50:  959| [45] [Watase opened the emergency staircase door.]
 51: 1014| [45] [Kazami and Jun threw aside their hoses at the same time and ran for the stairs.]
 52: 1019| [45] [Watase followed them on nigh-instinct.]
 53: 1076| [47] [Watase]
 54: 1079| [45] ["Hurry!"]
 55: 1084| [45] [The whole group crowded their way up the stairs as fast as they could.]
 56: 1140| [45] [Watase closed the fireproof door to the stairwell as soon as they made it back to B1.]
 57: 1145| [45] [And not even a second later-- the door shook with a roar.]
 58: 1250| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1253| [45] ["Agh!"]
 60: 1309| [45] [Watase was knocked down by the shockwave occurring on the other side.]
 61: 1314| [45] [He landed on his side and felt a keen pain run through the area around his ribs.]
 62: 1360| [47] [Watase]
 63: 1363| [45] ["Ghh, ugh...!"]
 64: 1374| [45] [He quickly shut the door again as he groaned.]
 65: 1379| [45] [It looked like an explosion had happened downstairs, and the blast had made it all the way up the stairs.]
 66: 1384| [45] ["If we'd been even a second slower..."-- That thought sent shivers down Watase's spine.]
 67: 1392| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1395| [45] ["Wh... what was that explosion?"]
 69: 1457| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1460| [45] ["A 'flashover'."]
 71: 1468| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1471| [45] ["A phenomenon where an explosion occurs when fire that's covering an entire area suddenly goes through thermal expansion."]
 73: 1497| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1500| [45] ["You saw how those flames were rolling like they were alive, right? That was a forewarning to it, so to speak."]
 75: 1508| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1511| [45] ["So that's why you told us to run..."]
 77: 1516| [45] [If they'd stayed there, they would all be burning to death right about now.]
 78: 1521| [45] [Watase gulped as it fully hit him just how ferocious that fire had been.]
 79: 1526| [45] [His ribs still ached from when he'd been knocked to the floor.]
 80: 1534| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1537| [45] ["But I'm glad we're all in one piece..."]
 82: 1614| [45] [He looked at Kazami as he said that-- only to find her leaning against the wall, her hand gripping her head.]
 83: 1622| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1625| [45] ["...!? Tachibana, what's wrong!?"]
 85: 1651| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1654| [45] ["N-nothing... just got a bit dizzy and a little headache all of a sudden..."]
 87: 1680| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1683| [45] ["A headache!? Could it be because you went downstairs without enough AD!?"]
 89: 1688| [45] [The fiery hallway they'd just escaped from had a reading of about "4300 mSv" according to the Procyon.]
 90: 1693| [45] [That was over the first danger standard-- an extremely dangerous zone to those without any AD.]
 91: 1701| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1704| [45] ["H-hey... you okay, Tachibana!?"]
 93: 1776| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1779| [45] ["... I-I'm fine, no problems at all."]
 95: 1787| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1790| [45] ["But to think the radiation would--"]
 97: 1816| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1819| [45] ["If they were subjective symptoms of radiation damage, they should not be manifesting this quickly."]
 99: 1827| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1830| [45] ["This is more likely due to carbon monoxide overexposure."]
101: 1835| [45] [Her face was still a bit pale.]
102: 1855| [47] [Watase]
103: 1858| [45] ["'Carbon monoxide overexposure'... don't you think you're being a bit too optimistic there?"]
104: 1866| [47] [Watase]
105: 1869| [45] ["I mean, I fainted right after I went into a contaminated zone even with AD."]
106: 1895| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1898| [45] ["...!"]
108: 1906| [47] [Watase]
109: 1909| [45] ["It could be way too dangerous for you, considering you didn't take a proper shot of--"]
110: 1935| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1938| [45] ["I am aware of all that! You do not have to remind me!"]
112: 1946| [47] [Watase]
113: 1949| [45] ["...!"]
114: 1954| [45] [Watase instinctively shut up at Kazami's sharp voice.]
115: 1959| [47] [Watase]
116: 1960| [45] [(Dammit, all I did was drive her into a corner...!)]
117: 1965| [45] [As Watase stood there, regretting his words, Kazami's face softened in realization.]
118: 1991| [47] [Kazami]
119: 1994| [45] ["... My apologies. I lost my composure for a moment there."]
120: 2020| [47] [Kazami]
121: 2023| [45] ["At any rate, let's head back to the control room. Going back to the lower floor is no longer an option."]
122: 2036| [47] [Watase]
123: 2037| [45] [(Maybe she's right, but we can't be optimistic, can we?)]
124: 2042| [45] [Even Watase had fainted with a violent headache right after he'd entered a contaminated zone.]
125: 2047| [45] [It was way too dangerous for someone without a full ampule of AD in their system like Kazami.]
126: 2052| [45] [Kazami spoke up with a firm voice as Watase thought that.]
127: 2078| [47] [Kazami]
128: 2081| [45] ["... At any rate, let's head back to the control room. Going back to the lower floor is no longer an option."]
129: 2089| [47] [Watase]
130: 2092| [45] ["R-right..."]
131: 2118| [47] [Jun]
132: 2121| [45] ["... Yeah."]
133: 2164| [45] [Kazami then started walking on ahead, followed shortly afterwards by Watase and Jun.]
134: 2169| [45] [--So that dosage of AD really hadn't been enough for her.]
135: 2174| [45] [Though injecting oneself with a drug stored in a damaged container was already in of itself extremely dangerous.]
136: 2179| [47] [Watase]
137: 2180| [45] [(We need to find some AD on the double...!)]
138: 2191| [45] [Watase then whispered into Jun's ear.]
139: 2254| [47] [Watase]
140: 2257| [45] ["... Moribe, Tachibana looks like she's having a real hard time. We have to support her..."]
141: 2283| [47] [Jun]
142: 2286| [45] ["I know that already! I know that..!"]
143: 2291| [45] [Watase and Jun nodded at each other and quickly marched towards the control room.]
144: 2297| [45] [Watase reaffirmed his determination and quickly marched towards the control room.]
