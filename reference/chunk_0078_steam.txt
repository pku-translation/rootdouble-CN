  1:   61| [45] [Watase quickly checked his watch when he left the bathroom.]
  2:   68| [45] [The time was exactly "1:16 PM".]
  3:   73| [47] [Watase]
  4:   74| [45] [(It's right about time to take some more AD, huh...)]
  5:   79| [45] [Watase administered himself with one of the ampules he had on him.]
  6:   85| [45] [The time was "1:19 PM".]
  7:   90| [45] [He realized his last dose of AD had already worn off.]
  8:   95| [47] [Watase]
  9:   96| [45] [(I hope everyone else remembers that they need to inject themselves with AD too...)]
 10:  101| [45] [Watase administered himself with one of the ampules he had on him.]
 11:  116| [47] [Watase]
 12:  119| [45] ["But... just five more hours or so to go until the lockdown lifts, huh."]
 13:  124| [45] [The road ahead was still long. To make things worse, he was so tired that his body felt like lead at this point.]
 14:  129| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Watase realized he'd only accumulated four hours worth of memories since he woke up.]
 15:  134| [45] [In other words, five hours was longer than the "life" Watase could remember so far.]
 16:  139| [45] [Watase walked down the hallway as he felt frustration towards the whole situation--%Nthen suddenly heard an unfamiliar voice.]
 17:  147| [47] [???]
 18:  150| [45] ["--...n't get any closer."]
 19:  155| [45] [The voice appeared to be coming from just past the corner in the hallway right up ahead.]
 20:  160| [45] [He then heard yet another voice echoing.]
 21:  168| [47] [Ena]
 22:  171| [45] ["--...hy are you trying to run away from us?"]
 23:  176| [45] [It appeared to be Ena's.]
 24:  181| [47] [Watase]
 25:  182| [45] [(Who's Teach talking to...?)]
 26:  187| [45] [He could tell from the voice that it probably wasn't Jun or Kazami.]
 27:  236| [45] [Watase peeked around the corner to see what was going on--]
 28:  431| [47] [Watase]
 29:  432| [45] [(--Isn't that...!?)]
 30:  437| [45] [--only to find Salyu standing in front of Ena.]
 31:  442| [45] [Watase immediately held his breath and listened in on their conversation.]
 32:  468| [47] [Ena]
 33:  471| [45] ["What are you even doing here in the first place?"]
 34:  479| [47] [Salyu]
 35:  482| [45] ["I could ask you the same."]
 36:  490| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  493| [45] ["Why are -you- here, Ena? I didn't expect to see you here after you paid no heed to the information we gave you yesterday."]
 38:  565| [47] [Ena]
 39:  568| [45] ["That's... didn't I tell you back then to 'leave the rest up to the adults'?%NIt's exactly as I said."]
 40:  594| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  597| [45] ["So basically, this is what you were 'up to'...?"]
 42:  602| [47] [Watase]
 43:  603| [45] [(... What're they talking about?)]
 44:  608| [45] [It didn't sound like Salyu was talking to Ena the way a student would to a teacher.]
 45:  613| [45] [And the details of their conversation felt private.]
 46:  625| [45] [Watase almost walked out into the open on instinct-- but he stopped himself at the last moment.]
 47:  630| [45] [He remembered how Salyu had abruptly run away from him last time.]
 48:  635| [47] [Watase]
 49:  636| [45] [(For now... I should trust Teach and watch how things play out.)]
 50:  646| [47] [Watase]
 51:  647| [45] [(I know this is eavesdropping... but the way Teach is acting is bugging me too for some reason...)]
 52:  652| [45] [Ena then resumed the conversation.]
 53:  678| [47] [Ena]
 54:  681| [45] ["I'll tell you the details later. Anyway, why don't you come with us? It's too dangerous to act alone right now."]
 55:  707| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  710| [45] ["I refuse."]
 57:  736| [47] [Ena]
 58:  739| [45] ["Why?"]
 59:  765| [47] [Salyu]
 60:  768| [45] ["Mashiro said your heart was closed. I trust her judgment."]
 61:  794| [47] [Ena]
 62:  797| [45] ["Wait, Ms. Toba is with you!? Where is she!?"]
 63:  823| [47] [Salyu]
 64:  826| [45] ["She's not with me now."]
 65:  852| [47] [Ena]
 66:  855| [45] ["... What do you mean?"]
 67:  878| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  879| [45] ["..."]
 69:  884| [45] [Salyu didn't answer.]
 70:  889| [45] [Ena soon started to grow impatient.]
 71:  915| [47] [Ena]
 72:  918| [45] ["... I admit that I've been keeping my heart closed, yes. That said, I don't have a choice in the matter."]
 73:  944| [47] [Ena]
 74:  947| [45] ["However, I'm on your side. Can't you trust me on that?"]
 75:  952| [47] [Salyu]
 76:  953| [45] ["..."]
 77:  958| [45] [Salyu paused for what felt like forever-- then spoke as if she'd made up her mind.]
 78:  985| [47] [Salyu]
 79:  988| [45] ["Ena, I will warn you about one thing out of consideration for Natsuhiko."]
 80:  996| [47] [Salyu]
 81:  999| [45] ["Be careful of that 'captain'. He's a dangerous man."]
 82: 1031| [47] [Ena]
 83: 1034| [45] ["Huh?"]
 84: 1039| [45] [--Just then.]
 85: 1134| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1137| [45] ["H-hey! What's that supposed to mean!?"]
 87: 1142| [45] [Watase instinctively rushed out from behind the corner.]
 88: 1168| [47] [Salyu]
 89: 1171| [45] ["!"]
 90: 1209| [45] [Salyu turned herself aside and started running off at that exact same moment.]
 91: 1235| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1238| [45] ["Ah, Ms. Sannomiya, wait!"]
 93: 1258| [45] [Ena immediately gave chase.]
 94: 1516| [45] [But Salyu pushed her away a second later.]
 95: 1551| [47] [Ena]
 96: 1554| [45] ["Ow!"]
 97: 1652| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1655| [45] ["!!"]
 99: 1660| [45] [Watase caught Ena before she hit the ground.]
100: 1665| [45] [Salyu took that opportunity to run into the connecting passageway that led to the outer ring--]
101: 1740| [45] [--and disappeared behind the security gate.]
102: 1748| [47] [Watase]
103: 1751| [45] ["Wait!"]
104: 1810| [45] [Watase quickly picked up the pursuit, but then the security gate shut before his eyes.]
105: 1879| [47] [Ena]
106: 1882| [45] ["Agh, for crying out loud!"]
107: 1887| [45] [Frustrated, Ena punched the closed gate.]
108: 1892| [45] [Watase quickly took out his card and opened the gate again--]
109: 1959| [45] [But Salyu was already long gone by then.]
