  2:   70| [45] [----]
  3:   75| [45] [--]
  4:   80| [45] [--Before long...]
  5:  111| [45] [An image surfaced from within the white darkness.]
  6:  116| [45] [It was a vision of a young Nagisa walking far away.]
  7:  121| [45] [Kazami's voice echoed from somewhere.]
  8:  134| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  137| [45] [{Nagisa! Wait, don't go!}]
 10:  145| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  148| [45] [{Don't go! You'll never be able to come back if you do!}]
 12:  153| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  154| [45] [(Is this... Ms. Tachibana's dream...?)]
 14:  159| [45] [Natsuhiko was experiencing the same dream through Kazami's five senses.]
 15:  184| [45] [Nagisa soon turned around--]
 16:  245| [45] [And smiled at Kazami.]
 17:  350| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  353| [45] ["--Nagisa!"]
 19:  358| [45] [Kazami then woke up.]
 20:  405| [47] [???]
 21:  408| [45] ["What's up, Sis?"]
 22:  463| [45] [Nagisa looked down upon Kazami.]
 23:  471| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  474| [45] ["Ah... Nagisa..."]
 25:  479| [45] [Kazami said that with clear relief.]
 26:  487| [47] [Nagisa]
 27:  490| [45] ["Are you okay? It looked like you were groaning in your sleep a bit...."]
 28:  498| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  501| [45] ["... I had a dream."]
 30:  509| [47] [Nagisa]
 31:  512| [45] ["A dream?"]
 32:  520| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  523| [45] ["Yes. A dream where you went off to somewhere far away..."]
 34:  531| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  534| [45] ["It was a very sad dream."]
 36:  542| [47] [Nagisa]
 37:  545| [45] ["I see..."]
 38:  553| [47] [Nagisa]
 39:  556| [45] ["But don't you see, Sis? You don't have to worry."]
 40:  564| [47] [Nagisa]
 41:  567| [45] ["I'm right here."]
 42:  575| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  578| [45] ["That's right..."]
 44:  583| [45] [Kazami smiled at Nagisa.]
 45:  591| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  594| [45] ["You've always been with me, haven't you?"]
 47:  602| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  605| [45] ["We've been together forever..."]
 49:  610| [45] [Tears welled up in Kazami's eyes.]
 50:  618| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  621| [45] ["Even after you've--"]
 52:  629| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  632| [45] ["Even after you've already died...!"]
 54:  655| [47] [Nagisa]
 55:  658| [45] ["..."]
 56:  663| [45] [Nagisa returned Kazami's smile at those words.]
 57:  807| [47] [Nagisa]
 58:  810| [45] ["Aw man, you figured it out?"]
 59:  818| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  821| [45] ["... Yes."]
 61:  829| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  832| [45] ["I realize that what I'm seeing is just a dream..."]
 63:  840| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  843| [45] ["And that in reality, you're gone..."]
 65:  869| [47] [Nagisa]
 66:  872| [45] ["... That's right."]
 67:  877| [45] [Kazami looked at Nagisa and spoke.]
 68:  885| [47] [Kazami]
 69:  888| [45] ["Even so, I was glad to see you again."]
 70:  914| [47] [Nagisa]
 71:  917| [45] ["Me too, Sis."]
 72:  925| [47] [Nagisa]
 73:  928| [45] ["'Cause I missed you so much all these years..."]
 74:  951| [45] [Nagisa grew quiet for a few seconds--]
 75:  956| [45] [Then she started softly speaking again.]
 76:  982| [47] [Nagisa]
 77:  985| [45] ["Actually, I tried to see you again just this one time shortly after I was locked away..."]
 78:  993| [47] [Nagisa]
 79:  996| [45] ["I tried to escape from LABO."]
 80: 1004| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1007| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 82: 1034| [47] [Nagisa]
 83: 1037| [45] ["But a Case N was declared right away, so that didn't work out..."]
 84: 1045| [47] [Nagisa]
 85: 1048| [45] ["And to make matters worse, I got two other kids caught up in all that, and their genes... mutated as a result."]
 86: 1056| [47] [Kazami]
 87: 1059| [45] ["... You're talking about..."]
 88: 1067| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1070| [45] ["Tenkawa and Ms. Yuuri...!"]
 90: 1096| [47] [Nagisa]
 91: 1099| [45] ["... So please, Sis."]
 92: 1107| [47] [Nagisa]
 93: 1110| [45] ["Don't blame those two."]
 94: 1118| [47] [Nagisa]
 95: 1121| [45] ["Nor Mr. Watase or anyone else."]
 96: 1129| [47] [Nagisa]
 97: 1132| [45] ["'Cause none of them were at fault..."]
 98: 1137| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1138| [45] ["..."]
100: 1146| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1149| [45] ["... Yes... you're right..."]
102: 1154| [45] [Nagisa gave a lonely smile when Kazami said that.]
103: 1252| [47] [Nagisa]
104: 1255| [45] ["... Okay then, it's about time for me to get going."]
105: 1263| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1266| [45] ["... Nagisa."]
107: 1274| [47] [Nagisa]
108: 1277| [45] ["Don't look so sad, okay?"]
109: 1285| [47] [Nagisa]
110: 1288| [45] ["I may be gone, but I'll live on in your memories."]
111: 1296| [47] [Nagisa]
112: 1299| [45] ["So just remember, and you can see me again any time..."]
113: 1307| [47] [Nagisa]
114: 1310| [45] ["I'll be with you forever so long as you remember me."]
115: 1318| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1321| [45] ["Yes... I know."]
117: 1329| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1332| [45] ["I'll never forget. I swear I'll never forget... that you're always with me."]
119: 1340| [47] [Nagisa]
120: 1343| [45] ["Yeah..."]
121: 1349| [45] [Nagisa stroked Kazami's cheek.]
122: 1357| [47] [Nagisa]
123: 1360| [45] ["Thanks, Sis."]
124: 1430| [45] [------]
125: 1435| [45] [----]
126: 1440| [45] [--And with that, they awoke from the dream.]
127: 1529| [45] [... Strangely enough, he didn't get the headache and uncomfortable brain-rattling sensation that he had felt the previous times.]
128: 1534| [45] [It wasn't long before his five senses gently came back.]
129: 1539| [45] [The first thing he heard with his newly returned hearing was the sound of Yuuri's tear-stricken voice.]
130: 1547| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 1550| [45] ["Hikorin...!"]
132: 1558| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 1561| [45] ["Hikorin, that girl's gone..."]
134: 1596| [45] [And the first thing he saw with his newly returned sight--]
135: 1621| [45] [Was Kazami slowly falling unconscious to the floor.]
136: 1680| [47] [Watase]
137: 1683| [45] ["--Kazami!"]
138: 1688| [45] [Watase ran up to Kazami.]
139: 1752| [45] [He caught her firmly in his arms just before she could hit the floor.]
140: 1760| [47] [Watase]
141: 1763| [45] ["Kazami! Kazami!"]
142: 1768| [45] [Watase called out her name over and over again.]
143: 1796| [47] [Mashiro]
144: 1799| [45] ["Natsuhiko...?"]
145: 1804| [45] [Mashiro's voice was full of bewilderment.]
146: 1812| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1815| [45] ["... It's over."]
148: 1823| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1826| [45] ["The malice is gone..."]
150: 1861| [45] [Kazami's eyes opened at the same time Natsuhiko said that.]
151: 1869| [47] [Kazami]
152: 1872| [45] ["Watase..."]
153: 1905| [47] [Jun]
154: 1908| [45] ["S-Sis...?"]
155: 1913| [45] [Jun called out to her nervously, but Kazami alleviated her fears by speaking in a gentle voice.]
156: 1947| [47] [Kazami]
157: 1950| [45] ["Jun... I'm sorry I worried you."]
158: 1976| [47] [Jun]
159: 1979| [45] ["Sis!!"]
160: 2052| [45] [Jun hugged Kazami while crying.]
161: 2057| [45] [Kazami gently stroked Jun's hair.]
162: 2065| [47] [Jun]
163: 2068| [45] ["Thank God! Thank God...!"]
164: 2076| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2079| [45] ["I'm sorry... I scared you to death, didn't I...?"]
166: 2084| [45] [Kazami whispered that to Jun, then turned to Watase.]
167: 2111| [47] [Kazami]
168: 2114| [45] ["I'm sorry, Watase... I hurt you so many times."]
169: 2140| [47] [Watase]
170: 2143| [45] ["No... I deserved it."]
171: 2169| [47] [Watase]
172: 2172| [45] ["Though of course, I don't think it was nearly enough to make up for my sins..."]
173: 2198| [47] [Kazami]
174: 2201| [45] ["That's enough... I mean it."]
175: 2209| [47] [Kazami]
176: 2212| [45] ["You tried to rescue the test subjects who were confined here in LABO."]
177: 2238| [47] [Kazami]
178: 2241| [45] ["You tried to save Nagisa..."]
179: 2249| [47] [Kazami]
180: 2252| [45] ["Even if you failed to do that in the end... I can't blame you."]
181: 2275| [47] [Watase]
182: 2276| [45] ["..."]
183: 2284| [47] [Kazami]
184: 2287| [45] ["Because you and I have been through similar lives."]
185: 2295| [47] [Kazami]
186: 2298| [45] ["So I understand your feelings better than anyone else..."]
187: 2371| [45] [Watase then silently embraced Kazami.]
188: 2376| [45] [Neither of them said another word...]
189: 2433| [45] [And after everything had ended--]
190: 2438| [45] [Watase walked up to Natsuhiko.]
191: 2514| [47] [Watase]
192: 2517| [45] ["... Thank you for not erasing Kazami's memories, Natsuhiko."]
193: 2525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2528| [45] ["No, I only did what I thought was right... I'm glad I didn't erase Ms. Tachibana's memories too."]
195: 2536| [47] [Watase]
196: 2539| [45] ["I see... you're right."]
197: 2565| [47] [Watase]
198: 2568| [45] ["... To be honest, I was scared of you up until now. I saw you as something of a monster who could manipulate others' memories as he saw fit..."]
199: 2576| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2579| [45] ["... That's understandable."]
201: 2605| [47] [Watase]
202: 2608| [45] ["But you never abused that power. You've only used it to save people in spite of the pain it brings you..."]
203: 2616| [47] [Watase]
204: 2619| [45] ["Thanks to that, I now finally understand. You're no monster."]
205: 2645| [47] [Watase]
206: 2648| [45] ["You're... just as human as the rest of us."]
207: 2653| [45] [Those words moved Natsuhiko's heart.]
208: 2658| [45] [He remembered something the Subject N in Watase's mind had once told him.]
209: 2725| [45] ["You use inhuman abilities to your heart's content to stomp on others. You know what they call a being like that? A monster, that's what."]
210: 2730| [45] [Those words had weighed heavily on his mind the whole time.]
211: 2794| [45] [But with Watase's words alone, the dark clouds shrouding Natsuhiko's heart felt as though they'd finally been lifted.]
212: 2799| [45] [However, in contrast to the broad smile that'd formed on Natsuhiko's face, Watase's face was full of gloom.]
213: 2825| [47] [Watase]
214: 2828| [45] ["... Compared to that, I'm just a stupid bastard."]
215: 2836| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2839| [45] ["Huh?"]
217: 2902| [47] [Watase]
218: 2905| [45] ["Natsuhiko... thank you for not erasing Kazami's memories."]
219: 2913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 2916| [45] ["No... I only did what I thought was right."]
221: 2924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2927| [45] ["... I'm glad I didn't erase Ms. Tachibana's memories too."]
223: 2935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2938| [45] ["Because I heard what she just said."]
225: 2964| [47] [Watase]
226: 2967| [45] ["...?"]
227: 2975| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 2978| [45] ["I remembered something after hearing Ms. Tachibana talk just now."]
229: 2986| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 2989| [45] ["You may be a terrorist-- but you carried out this plot in order to save the test subjects, right?"]
231: 3015| [47] [Watase]
232: 3018| [45] ["Ah, well, yeah..."]
233: 3026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3029| [45] ["It's thanks to you that Yuuri and I were able to see each other again..."]
235: 3037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
236: 3040| [45] ["So... so..."]
237: 3048| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 3051| [45] ["Let me express my gratitude! Thank you!"]
239: 3075| [45] [Natsuhiko held his hand out to Watase.]
240: 3099| [45] [Watase gripped that hand with a wry smile.]
241: 3107| [47] [Watase]
242: 3110| [45] ["I don't deserve to be thanked. It's not like I did it for your sake."]
243: 3118| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 3121| [45] ["... I suppose not."]
245: 3126| [45] [Watase's hand was warm.]
246: 3131| [45] [With that physical contact, Natsuhiko finally felt he was free from the hostility he had towards Watase.]
247: 3136| [45] [But-- Watase soon spoke up in a serious voice.]
248: 3164| [47] [Watase]
249: 3167| [45] ["Hey, Natsuhiko... there's something I've got to tell you."]
250: 3193| [47] [Watase]
251: 3196| [45] ["When we went down to Area Zero, I realized I did something I can never take back."]
252: 3204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 3207| [45] ["...? What do you mean?"]
254: 3239| [47] [Watase]
255: 3242| [45] ["I'm talking about the bomb."]
256: 3250| [47] [Watase]
257: 3253| [45] ["We can't disarm it. And to make matters worse--"]
258: 3279| [47] [Watase]
259: 3282| [45] ["It'll go off before the lockdown is lifted."]
260: 3311| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 3314| [45] ["!?"]
262: 3319| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and Ena's eyes widened in shock.]
