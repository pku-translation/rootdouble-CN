  1:   53| [45] [--Natsuhiko's thoughts sped frantically through his mind as he stood frozen in place.]
  2:   58| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   59| [45] [(How is someone like me supposed to choose...!?)]
  4:  115| [45] [To Communicators like Natsuhiko and his friends, Rokumei City had been a paradise.]
  5:  202| [45] [But he now saw the madness that world was filled with.]
  6:  254| [45] [Nagisa's death had become like a great thorn, piercing his heart.]
  7:  259| [45] [The day-to-day life he once thought precious was built upon the sacrifice of many others.]
  8:  264| [45] [And-- perhaps sacrifice was indeed necessary to right the wrongs of the world.]
  9:  338| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  339| [45] [(But even so...!)]
 11:  362| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Yuuri, who was standing by his side.]
 12:  367| [45] [She had let herself be locked away deep under LABO for nine years to protect Natsuhiko's peaceful life.]
 13:  372| [45] [He could feel her warmth through her hand.]
 14:  377| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  378| [45] [(I don't want to let go of her again...!)]
 16:  383| [45] [A few hours ago, Natsuhiko would have probably taken Yuuri in a heartbeat.]
 17:  388| [45] [But things were different now that he knew about Nagisa's death and the truth behind Rokumei City's facade.]
 18:  393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  394| [45] [(If I knew things would turn out like this, I never would've bothered searching for the truth in the first place...!)]
 20:  399| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth with that thought, but then--]
 21:  404| [45] [Yuuri smiled and spoke.]
 22:  430| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  433| [45] ["... Hey, Hikorin, don't beat yourself over it so much, okay?"]
 24:  441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  444| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 26:  470| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  473| [45] ["There's no need for you to make a decision at all. I mean, this is what I promised Captain Kasasagi, remember?"]
 28:  481| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  484| [45] ["Isn't that right, Captain Kasasagi...? So I'm going to keep my promise."]
 30:  516| [47] [Watase]
 31:  517| [45] ["..."]
 32:  522| [45] [Watase said nothing in response.]
 33:  554| [45] [Natsuhiko just stood there in a daze as Yuuri continued.]
 34:  583| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  586| [45] ["... I'm glad I made that deal with Captain Kasasagi back then, because that's what allowed everyone to get out of LABO safely."]
 36:  594| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  597| [45] ["So... so that's why..."]
 38:  605| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  608| [45] ["I'm going to go with Captain Kasasagi."]
 40:  622| [45] [Yuuri said that, then tried to walk away from Natsuhiko.]
 41:  673| [45] [But-- he wouldn't let her go.]
 42:  681| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  684| [45] ["No, Yuuri! There's no way in hell I can let you leave!"]
 44:  692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  695| [45] ["We're gonna go back to the others together!"]
 46:  721| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  724| [45] ["But... Hikorin..."]
 48:  729| [45] [Just then, Watase finally broke his silence.]
 49:  764| [47] [Watase]
 50:  767| [45] ["Natsuhiko. Stopping her with words isn't what you need to do now."]
 51:  775| [47] [Watase]
 52:  778| [45] ["No, what you need to do is act."]
 53:  786| [47] [Watase]
 54:  789| [45] ["If you want to be with Yuuri, then there's something you have to do first, right?"]
 55:  794| [45] [Watase's voice was stern.]
 56:  858| [45] [But the light in his eyes was mysteriously gentle--]
 57:  881| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  884| [45] ["...!"]
 59:  944| [45] [It was then that Natsuhiko realized what Watase wanted.]
 60:  949| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  950| [45] [(So I have to do it...!?)]
 62:  976| [47] [Watase]
 63:  979| [45] ["Yes, you have to do it."]
 64:  984| [45] [Watase muttered that as if he'd read Natsuhiko's mind.]
 65:  995| [45] [He then began to put pressure on his gun's trigger--]
 66: 1005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1008| [45] ["Watase!!"]
 68: 1066| [45] [And at that moment, Natsuhiko used Senses Sympathy one last time.]
 69: 1185| [45] [--His field of vision was filled with radiant light.]
 70: 1190| [45] [He felt something warm flow through him from the depths of Watase's mind.]
 71: 1243| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1246| [45] [{... Good. This is how it should be, Natsuhiko.}]
 73: 1299| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1302| [45] [{Sacrificing you kids is the truly wrong thing to do here.}]
 75: 1307| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1310| [45] [{And you acted only after you understood my feelings, right?}]
 77: 1333| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1336| [45] [{So I... accept this decision.}]
 79: 1349| [45] [And with that thought, Watase's mind began to quietly crumble apart.]
 80: 1354| [45] [All his memories were vanishing.]
 81: 1367| [45] [A lone question came to his mind from a fragment of those thoughts.]
 82: 1442| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1445| [45] [{Hey, Wataru... was I wrong?}]
 84: 1509| [45] [But those words faded into light--...]
