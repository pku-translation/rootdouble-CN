  1:   60| [45] [Watase and Jun first entered B2 of the inner ring.]
  2:  160| [47] [Jun]
  3:  163| [45] ["Those kids should be in this area, right...?"]
  4:  171| [47] [Watase]
  5:  174| [45] ["Yeah, I'm sure of it."]
  6:  224| [45] [After that brief exchange, the two of them checked all the rooms in a hurry.]
  7:  267| [45] [All the while believing they'd find the survivors in one of them.]
  8:  334| [45] [However--]
  9:  439| [45] [Their search yielded no results.]
 10:  501| [47] [Jun]
 11:  504| [45] ["They're not here...?"]
 12:  512| [47] [Watase]
 13:  515| [45] ["No, hold on... let's check B1."]
 14:  520| [45] [They then headed in the direction of the stairwell--]
 15:  565| [45] [But the inner ring's emergency staircase was unusable.]
 16:  570| [45] [The part on B1 was intact, but everything below it had crumbled, leaving it impossible to climb.]
 17:  578| [47] [Watase]
 18:  581| [45] ["Tch, not again."]
 19:  614| [47] [Jun]
 20:  617| [45] ["Boy, this is the pits. The factory's basically two floors in one room, so this is the only staircase..."]
 21:  643| [47] [Jun]
 22:  646| [45] ["Should we use the elevator shaft again?"]
 23:  654| [47] [Watase]
 24:  657| [45] ["No, wait, is there any way we can get up...?"]
 25:  662| [45] [It was at that moment that Watase remembered what he had with him.]
 26:  722| [45] [The 10 meter rope he'd been carrying around this whole time.]
 27:  730| [47] [Watase]
 28:  733| [45] ["I think we'll be able to get up with this."]
 29:  768| [45] [Watase calmly picked up some debris and tied the end of the rope to it.]
 30:  779| [45] [He then tossed the rope up, and it caught on the B1 staircase.]
 31:  842| [45] [He tugged it several times to test its strength, but it appeared that the rope was firmly secure.]
 32:  850| [47] [Watase]
 33:  853| [45] ["Good, we can do this!"]
 34:  879| [47] [Jun]
 35:  882| [45] ["Nice one! Okay, first one to the top wins!"]
 36:  890| [47] [Watase]
 37:  893| [45] ["Hey, how're we supposed to race each other when there's only one rope? Just climb normally."]
 38:  919| [47] [Jun]
 39:  922| [45] ["Aw c'mon, you're such a killjoy."]
 40:  965| [45] [The two of them climbed the rope as they smiled at their playful exchange.]
 41: 1009| [45] [--The two of them then left the rope where it was.]
 42: 1014| [45] [That way they could use it again when they had to go back down, and there was a chance they might need to climb back up anyway.]
 43: 1061| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1064| [45] ["Okay, then let's move on with the search. This is the only other block we haven't explored yet."]
 45: 1126| [47] [Jun]
 46: 1129| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 47: 1143| [45] [The two of them then started searching the floor in high spirits.]
 48: 1187| [45] [The first room they went to appeared to not have been touched by the fire at all.]
 49: 1192| [45] [Jun shouted as soon as she walked in.]
 50: 1254| [47] [Jun]
 51: 1257| [45] ["Hey, isn't that a Procyon!?"]
 52: 1265| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1268| [45] ["Huh?"]
 54: 1366| [45] [Watase looked closer to find a familiar device was lying in a corner of the room.]
 55: 1379| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1382| [45] ["What's something like this doing here?"]
 57: 1408| [47] [Jun]
 58: 1411| [45] ["It's not that surprising. LABO -was- the one who gave us the Procyons in the first place, after all."]
 59: 1419| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1422| [45] ["Oh, right. Anyway, this is a pretty good find."]
 61: 1448| [47] [Jun]
 62: 1451| [45] ["Yep! Now we can split into three teams!"]
 63: 1456| [45] [They didn't know if the need for that would ever arise, but the two of them decided to take it just to be safe.]
 64: 1461| [45] [They looked around to see if there was anything else worth taking with them.]
 65: 1466| [45] [Though they didn't find any AD-- there was a bound stack of papers on the table that Watase took interest in.]
 66: 1474| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1477| [45] ["... Hmm? 'Disaster Prevention Manual'?"]
 68: 1503| [47] [Jun]
 69: 1506| [45] ["Isn't that the thing Yuuri found a while back?"]
 70: 1514| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1517| [45] ["No, it's a bit different. This one says 'For Area 5 and 6 Staff'."]
 72: 1522| [45] [Watase and Jun stood together to read the manual.]
 73: 1527| [45] [Most of it was more or less the same as the one Yuuri had shown them, but there was a new page at the very end not present in the other manual.]
 74: 1565| [45] ["Disaster Prevention Manual (2030 Edition/For Area 5 and 6 Staff)"]
 75: 1568| [85] [　]
 76: 1571| [45] [<Regarding Emergency Evacuation Routes>]
 77: 1574| [85] [　]
 78: 1577| [45] [In the event of a fire, earthquake, or other such disasters, the elevators will automatically ascend to the surface floors and stay there.]
 79: 1580| [45] [This is because there is a risk that the elevators could stop while in operation due to an unpredictable shock, therefore trapping their passengers.]
 80: 1583| [45] [Please use the emergency staircases located in each block to evacuate.]
 81: 1586| [45] [However, Area 6's outer ring does not have any emergency staircases due to security risks and the facility's structure.]
 82: 1589| [45] [Therefore, all staff should evacuate through the inner ring, but if a situation arises where that becomes too difficult, please evacuate through the "cargo lift".]
 83: 1593| [85] [ %N]
 84: 1596| [45] [<Regarding usage of cargo lift for evacuation>]
 85: 1599| [85] [　]
 86: 1602| [45] [Unlike the normal elevators, the cargo lift is extremely sturdy.]
 87: 1605| [45] [In theory, it should be able to resist even Magnitude 7 earthquakes and have very little risk of stopping.]
 88: 1608| [45] [Therefore, all staff members are granted temporary permission to use the lift to evacuate during a crisis.]
 89: 1611| [45] [Please use it to promptly evacuate to the surface.]
 90: 1614| [45] [The same rights will also be granted in the event of a Case N.]
 91: 1617| [45] [Should evacuation of the facility become impossible due to the bulkhead lockdown, the cargo lift can be used to evacuate to a safe zone in the surface floors.]
 92: 1646| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1649| [45] ["A cargo lift...!?"]
 94: 1654| [45] [The two of them started trembling when they read that passage.]
 95: 1680| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1683| [45] ["'Evacuate to a safe zone'... does that mean...!?"]
 97: 1691| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1694| [45] ["That there's a way for us to escape to the surface-- even in this situation!?"]
 99: 1717| [45] [Watase and Jun looked at each other. They were both grinning from ear to ear.]
100: 1722| [45] [After being trapped in the basement all this time-- they'd finally found the clue they needed about the one escape route that still worked!]
101: 1748| [47] [Jun]
102: 1751| [45] ["But where the heck is it!?"]
103: 1759| [47] [Watase]
104: 1762| [45] ["It might be somewhere in that burnt to hell factory... though I didn't notice anything earlier..."]
105: 1770| [47] [Watase]
106: 1773| [45] ["But we need to look for the survivors first! Locating an escape route means nothing if we don't find them!"]
107: 1799| [47] [Jun]
108: 1802| [45] ["Damn right!"]
109: 1807| [45] [Watase shoved the manual into his pocket and ran out of the room.]
110: 1850| [45] [However-- in the end, they went through all the rooms, yet found no hide nor hair of the survivors or any AD.]
111: 1913| [47] [Watase]
112: 1916| [45] ["Let's check the connecting passageway. We can't leave any stone unturned."]
113: 1959| [45] [The two of them headed for the connecting passageway that led to the factory.]
114: 2004| [45] [But the passageway was blocked by debris further in, so they couldn't travel past that.]
115: 2009| [45] [The only thing up ahead was the factory, meaning that they'd completed their search of the inner ring.]
116: 2068| [45] [Jun frowned in puzzlement as they turned around.]
117: 2076| [47] [Jun]
118: 2079| [45] ["That's odd... we didn't find Natsuhiko or anybody else here."]
119: 2087| [47] [Watase]
120: 2090| [45] ["Yeah, I agree. But maybe they're in the factory."]
121: 2116| [47] [Jun]
122: 2119| [45] ["Then let's go back and help the other team with their search!"]
123: 2127| [47] [Watase]
124: 2130| [45] ["Yeah. Or maybe they--"]
125: 2135| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
126: 2162| [45] [he suddenly heard a sound at his feet.]
127: 2188| [47] [Jun]
128: 2191| [45] ["!?"]
129: 2199| [47] [Watase]
130: 2202| [45] ["What was that!?"]
131: 2242| [45] [Both of them looked down in surprise-- and found that there were cracks where Jun was standing.]
132: 2247| [47] [Watase]
133: 2248| [45] [(The floor's giving way!)]
134: 2273| [45] [Just as Watase thought that-- time slowed down for him.]
135: 2298| [45] [He was seeing everything in slow motion.]
136: 2325| [45] [Jun tried to jump back at once.]
137: 2330| [45] [But-- the floor at her feet collapsed right then.]
138: 2451| [47] [Jun]
139: 2454| [45] ["Hyaah!"]
140: 2474| [47] [Watase]
141: 2477| [45] ["Moribe!"]
142: 2482| [45] [Watase shot his hand out as fast as lightning and grabbed Jun's arm.]
143: 2494| [45] [Pain ran through his cracked ribs instantly.]
144: 2499| [47] [Watase]
145: 2500| [45] [(Ghh!!)]
146: 2505| [45] [But he put up with it and grasped Jun's arm tightly.]
147: 2510| [45] [Dust blew up from the crumbled floor, but it soon began to clear up--]
148: 2584| [45] [Revealing Jun's face on the other side.]
149: 2592| [47] [Watase]
150: 2595| [45] ["Phew..."]
151: 2603| [47] [Watase]
152: 2606| [45] ["That sure was a close call, wasn't it?"]
153: 2614| [47] [Jun]
154: 2617| [45] ["Captain...! Incredible! It all happened so fast that I couldn't react, but you...!"]
155: 2625| [47] [Watase]
156: 2628| [45] ["Well... I thought it looked dangerous, that's all."]
157: 2636| [47] [Jun]
158: 2639| [45] ["Still, I nearly had a heart attack there... I didn't think the floor would just collapse so suddenly like that."]
159: 2647| [47] [Watase]
160: 2650| [45] ["Yeah, that was scary. It must have been your weight that broke the passageway."]
161: 2698| [47] [Jun]
162: 2701| [45] ["Hey, were you born with no manners at all!? That's not something you tell a lady!"]
163: 2709| [47] [Watase]
164: 2712| [45] ["Ha ha ha, I'm just kidding. I'm gonna pull you up now, so give me your hand."]
165: 2720| [47] [Jun]
166: 2723| [45] ["Roger-dodger."]
167: 2728| [45] [Watase grabbed Jun's other hand and pulled her up.]
168: 2790| [47] [Watase]
169: 2793| [45] ["... You're not hurt, are you?"]
170: 2819| [47] [Jun]
171: 2822| [45] ["Nope... not physically. But my heart's been horribly wounded, no thanks to someone."]
172: 2830| [47] [Watase]
173: 2833| [45] ["That's good. But still--"]
174: 2838| [45] [Watase looked at the now partially collapsed passageway.]
175: 2846| [47] [Watase]
176: 2849| [45] ["I guess Area 6 got damaged really badly by that fire..."]
177: 2875| [47] [Jun]
178: 2878| [45] ["Yeah... I hope the others are okay."]
179: 2886| [47] [Watase]
180: 2889| [45] ["Let's get back to them and make sure."]
181: 2894| [45] [The two of them nodded at each other, then ran through the passageway together.]
