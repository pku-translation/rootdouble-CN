  0:   59| [45] [--Natsuhiko continued reading Jun's memories.]
  1:  109| [45] [Everything from when she entered a contaminated zone, found AD,]
  2:  162| [45] [helped the rest of the group save Yuuri when she was almost crushed by falling debris in the factory--]
  3:  169| [45] [and finally, when she watched them force open the gate to the cargo lift with a crane.]
  4:  174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  175| [45] [(Yes, this is it... this is where that memory is...!)]
  6:  210| [47] [Jun]
  7:  213| [45] ["Alrighty, then I'll go in first to make sure it's safe!"]
  8:  239| [47] [Watase]
  9:  242| [45] ["Yeah, we're counting on you."]
 10:  250| [47] [Jun]
 11:  253| [45] ["Yep, just leave it to me--"]
 12:  301| [45] [Jun went through the opening in high spirits.]
 13:  308| [45] [But on the other side of the gate--]
 14:  465| [47] [Jun]
 15:  468| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!"]
 16:  473| [45] [... all they'd found there was the unidentified body of a girl.]
 17:  512| [45] [--Natsuhiko witnessed that sight through Jun's eyes.]
 18:  517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  518| [45] [(This is when Jun was infected with malice...!)]
 20:  523| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  524| [45] [(Then shouldn't that girl be showing up any second now!?)]
 22:  529| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  530| [45] [(A remnant of Subject N's spirit must be here!)]
 24:  560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  563| [45] ["Isn't that right... Subject N?"]
 26:  568| [45] [Natsuhiko spoke to the corpse.]
 27:  576| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  579| [45] ["Now come on out... I'll erase your malice from Jun!"]
 29:  584| [45] [When Natsuhiko shouted that--]
 30:  594| [47] [???]
 31:  597| [45] ["--You come to kill me?"]
 32:  602| [45] [Subject N answered.]
 33:  622| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  623| [45] [(...!)]
 35:  692| [45] [She slowly stood up and glared at Natsuhiko.]
 36:  697| [45] [Natsuhiko looked back at her, then replied.]
 37:  705| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  708| [45] ["... No, not to kill. I'm just repairing these memories back to their original state."]
 39:  734| [47] [Subject N]
 40:  737| [45] ["Wrong. What you're doing sure as hell ain't repairing, bro."]
 41:  745| [47] [Subject N]
 42:  748| [45] ["And what the hell do you mean by their 'original state' anyway? Aren't you just deluding yourself to believe that?"]
 43:  774| [47] [Subject N]
 44:  777| [45] ["You're just distorting these memories and rebuilding them as you see fit... If that's your idea of repairing, then that's hilarious."]
 45:  785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  788| [45] ["... Well, maybe it's exactly as you say."]
 47:  796| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  799| [45] ["But if I leave you alone, people will really die."]
 49:  807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  810| [45] ["I'm not talking about this mental world here. I mean the real world."]
 51:  818| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  821| [45] ["I can't just let that slide. Not a chance."]
 53:  847| [47] [Subject N]
 54:  850| [45] ["But my body is long dead. And you erased the traces of myself that I left in Jun's memories."]
 55:  858| [47] [Subject N]
 56:  861| [45] ["You're annihilating me. No matter how you try to sugarcoat it, in the end, it's still murder."]
 57:  869| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  872| [45] ["Jun just can't be herself as long as you're still in her mind."]
 59:  898| [47] [Subject N]
 60:  901| [45] ["Oh? You talk as if I'm some sort of evil spirit. Are you saying I'm possessing Jun?"]
 61:  909| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  912| [45] ["It's not exactly what you'd call possession..."]
 63:  920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  923| [45] ["But you used BC on Jun."]
 65:  931| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  934| [45] ["BC isn't just the power to convey words and memories to others-- but 'feelings' too."]
 67:  942| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  945| [45] ["Things that can't be expressed in words, memories that can't be imagined-- and your vast malice."]
 69:  953| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  956| [45] ["All of those feelings are now in Jun's brain as information energy..."]
 71:  964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  967| [45] ["And once she took them in, Jun ceased to be her normal self."]
 73:  993| [47] [Subject N]
 74:  996| [45] ["'Jun's normal self'? The hell is that? What do you know about Jun?"]
 75: 1004| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1007| [45] ["I know her. I grew connected to Jun through her and Watase's memories."]
 77: 1015| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78: 1018| [45] ["Jun is normally cheerful, strong, and full of a sense of justice..."]
 79: 1026| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1029| [45] ["... I have to bring her back to normal."]
 81: 1034| [45] [Natsuhiko stared at Subject N and spoke.]
 82: 1042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1045| [45] ["If erasing you is the same thing as killing you..."]
 84: 1053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1056| [45] ["Then I'll stain my hands with that sin as many times as needed."]
 86: 1079| [45] [Subject N glared at Natsuhiko when he declared that.]
 87: 1087| [47] [Subject N]
 88: 1090| [45] ["I see... so this is a battle to the death between you and me, huh?"]
 89: 1098| [47] [Subject N]
 90: 1101| [45] ["Who'll be quicker to the draw-- me with my destruction of your mind, or you with your erasure of me?"]
 91: 1127| [47] [Subject N]
 92: 1130| [45] ["Only one way to find out!"]
 93: 1135| [45] [Malice descended upon Natsuhiko like a gale with that shout.]
 94: 1203| [45] [It was full of the many negative feelings in Jun's mind.]
 95: 1236| [45] [An ugly mind composed of indignation and jealousy.]
 96: 1269| [45] [All of that had been amplified to the nth power and was worming its way into Natsuhiko's mind.]
 97: 1302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1303| [45] [(Khh...!)]
 99: 1336| [45] [Natsuhiko faltered for a moment. However--]
100: 1341| [45] [Yuuri's voice soon echoed in his head.]
101: 1410| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1413| [45] [{It's okay, Hikorin! This is just like what happened back in Captain Kasasagi's mind!}]
103: 1418| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1421| [45] [{Your mind will never break as long as I'm here with you!}]
105: 1426| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1429| [45] [{You should be able to beat the malice!}]
107: 1434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1435| [45] [(Y-yeah!)]
109: 1498| [45] [Those words gave Natsuhiko's mind the strength it needed.]
110: 1503| [45] [Natsuhiko focused with all his spirit--]
111: 1508| [45] [And desired for Subject N's erasure from the bottom of his heart.]
112: 1580| [47] [Subject N]
113: 1583| [45] ["!!"]
114: 1588| [45] [He felt like he heard Subject N scream at that moment.]
115: 1593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1594| [45] [(D... did I do it?)]
117: 1693| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko thought that...]
118: 1698| [45] [He realized how clear it felt, now that the vast malice controlling Jun's heart had vanished.]
