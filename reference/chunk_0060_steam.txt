  0:   46| [55] [√After Chapter 4]
  1:   61| [45] [--Area 6, inner ring, B2--]
  2:   66| [45] [It'd been nearly an hour since they last searched this place.]
  3:   71| [45] [The team opened one of the nearby doors and went in--]
  4:  115| [45] [And were faced with a large laboratory.]
  5:  120| [45] [There were a lot of blind spots, meaning it'd be hard to tell right away if anyone happened to be collapsed behind one of them.]
  6:  197| [47] [Watase]
  7:  200| [45] ["I don't think they're here, but let's search to be safe."]
  8:  208| [47] [Ena]
  9:  211| [45] ["All right."]
 10:  219| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  222| [45] ["Roger."]
 12:  265| [45] [The team then began their search of the room.]
 13:  270| [45] [But there was no hide nor hair of the survivors or any AD.]
 14:  275| [47] [Watase]
 15:  276| [45] [(Tch. Maybe I can find some information about how to escape from here instead?)]
 16:  281| [45] [Just as this thought crossed Watase's mind-- he heard Ena talking to herself deeper in the room.]
 17:  289| [47] [Ena]
 18:  292| [45] ["Oh... what's this?"]
 19:  300| [47] [Watase]
 20:  303| [45] ["What's what?"]
 21:  363| [45] [Watase ran over to Ena. She was pointing at a white board.]
 22:  368| [45] [Written on it was the following:]
 23:  406| [45] [--From the tear rain to Altair and the bridge of bird wings--]
 24:  409| [85] [　]
 25:  412| [45] [Did you guys manage to escape?]
 26:  415| [45] [Or are you still here?]
 27:  418| [45] [I haven't found you after all my searching,%Nso perhaps you're long gone.]
 28:  421| [45] [But I'd like to reunite with you as soon as possible if you are indeed still here.]
 29:  424| [45] [If you guys are the ones reading this, then answer the following question:]
 30:  427| [85] [ %N]
 31:  430| [45] ["Was Sirius able to escape from his cage on that night of the full moon?"]
 32:  459| [47] [Watase]
 33:  462| [45] ["... The hell's this?"]
 34:  467| [45] [Normally, one would expect to see, say, sentences concerning the contents of some discussion held during a meeting written on the board, but this didn't look like that at all.]
 35:  493| [47] [Ena]
 36:  496| [45] ["Mmm... it looks like a message from one person to another..."]
 37:  504| [47] [Watase]
 38:  507| [45] ["A message?"]
 39:  533| [47] [Ena]
 40:  536| [45] ["I mean, doesn't it kinda look like the letter I wrote earlier?"]
 41:  544| [47] [Watase]
 42:  547| [45] ["I see... well, when I see 'Sirius', the name of our rescue team's the first thing that comes to mind..."]
 43:  555| [47] [Watase]
 44:  558| [45] ["You don't think this is addressed to us, do you?"]
 45:  584| [47] [Ena]
 46:  587| [45] ["If we go by that line of thinking, then perhaps the 'cage' mentioned here could be referring to our plight of 'being trapped in LABO due to the lockdown'..."]
 47:  613| [47] [Ena]
 48:  616| [45] ["But what's this whole 'night of the full moon' deal about? I'm pretty sure there's no full moon today, and it's not even nighttime yet."]
 49:  624| [47] [Watase]
 50:  627| [45] ["Mmm... beats me."]
 51:  632| [45] [It might as well have been complete gibberish to them.]
 52:  637| [45] [--But as Watase looked over those sentences--]
 53:  642| [47] [Watase]
 54:  643| [45] [(...?)]
 55:  648| [45] [A strange feeling welled up in him for some reason.]
 56:  653| [45] [It was by no means an unpleasant one.]
 57:  658| [45] [It was a warm and heartrending emotion... mixed with nostalgia, relief, and sorrow.]
 58:  684| [47] [Ena]
 59:  687| [45] ["...? Hey, what's wrong?"]
 60:  695| [47] [Watase]
 61:  698| [45] ["Well... I'm not quite sure, but..."]
 62:  703| [45] [Just then, Ukita called out to them from behind.]
 63:  711| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  714| [45] ["--What are you two up to -this- time?"]
 65:  757| [47] [Watase]
 66:  760| [45] ["Oh, right... Teach found some weird sentences here."]
 67:  786| [47] [Ena]
 68:  789| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, do you know what they mean?"]
 69:  815| [47] [Ukita]
 70:  818| [45] ["Hmm..."]
 71:  823| [45] [Ukita glanced at the white board, then sighed.]
 72:  849| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  852| [45] ["No, I don't... More importantly, do we really have time to be wasting on looking at this?"]
 74:  860| [47] [Watase]
 75:  863| [45] ["Well, no, but doesn't it make you curious?"]
 76:  889| [47] [Ena]
 77:  892| [45] ["He's right. This could be a message left behind by Ms. Toba or Ms. Sannomiya."]
 78:  918| [47] [Ukita]
 79:  921| [45] ["A message? Don't be ridiculous."]
 80:  929| [47] [Ukita]
 81:  932| [45] ["If it were, then why would they write all this nonsense?"]
 82:  958| [47] [Ena]
 83:  961| [45] ["Then what -is- it, then?"]
 84:  987| [47] [Ukita]
 85:  990| [45] ["How in the world would I know that?"]
 86: 1016| [47] [Ukita]
 87: 1019| [45] ["At any rate, we can't stay here going over such pointless details like this. All you're doing is bringing the search to a total halt, right?"]
 88: 1045| [47] [Ena]
 89: 1048| [45] ["..."]
 90: 1053| [45] [Everything Ukita said from start to finish was harsh.]
 91: 1058| [45] [Ena was clearly not happy about his attitude, but she said nothing.]
 92: 1063| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1064| [45] [(... This is bad. The atmosphere's been totally strained for a while now thanks to the old man...)]
 94: 1069| [45] [That said, yelling at him to shut up wasn't an option either. It'd just lead to more bickering like before.]
 95: 1074| [45] [Thus Watase spoke in the friendliest voice he could muster.]
 96: 1082| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1085| [45] ["Well, maybe it's best we just do what the old man says on this matter. Isn't that right, Teach?"]
 98: 1111| [47] [Ena]
 99: 1114| [45] ["Huh...?"]
100: 1122| [47] [Watase]
101: 1125| [45] ["Just keep those sentences on the backburner and continue with the search for now."]
102: 1130| [45] [Ena looked even more peeved at Watase's dismissal-- but she eventually just snorted.]
103: 1156| [47] [Ena]
104: 1159| [45] ["... Fine, got it. Let's go with that."]
105: 1164| [45] [Watase breathed a sigh of relief when he heard that.]
106: 1169| [45] [--But at the same time, it finally hit him.]
107: 1174| [45] [Searching together with just these two civilians was extremely difficult.]
108: 1179| [47] [Watase]
109: 1180| [45] [(... No, I mustn't complain...)]
110: 1185| [47] [Watase]
111: 1186| [45] [(I need to be more level headed. I need to keep up the search while making sure those two don't get into fights.)]
112: 1229| [45] [Watase mentally resolved himself and left the room with Ena and Ukita.]
