  1:   73| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   76| [45] ["AHHHHHHH!!"]
  3:   81| [45] [--Natsuhiko couldn't help but scream as he returned to reality.]
  4:   86| [45] [Mashiro called out to him in surprise.]
  5:  148| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  151| [45] ["Wh-what happened, Natsuhiko!?"]
  7:  159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  162| [45] ["I-I don't know!"]
  9:  188| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  191| [45] ["I don't know either, but... Ms. Tachibana spoke to us in the middle of Senses Sympathy...!"]
 11:  217| [47] [Ena]
 12:  220| [45] ["What do you mean!? Did you finish the malice erasure!?"]
 13:  228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  231| [45] ["N-no, we didn't..."]
 15:  257| [47] [Yuuri]
 16:  260| [45] ["We don't know what happened, either..."]
 17:  343| [45] [In confusion, they looked at Kazami...]
 18:  348| [45] [... who then spoke in a chilling voice.]
 19:  375| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  378| [45] ["... That was too careless of you two."]
 21:  386| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  389| [45] ["You should've known that diving into someone's mind means exposing your own."]
 23:  397| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  400| [45] ["Thanks to your mistake, I now have the answer I've been looking for."]
 25:  427| [47] [Yuuri]
 26:  430| [45] ["Th-the answer you've been looking for...!?"]
 27:  462| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  465| [45] ["The reason why that girl-- the one you people call 'Subject N'-- died here."]
 29:  491| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  494| [45] ["The answer was in your memories."]
 31:  520| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  523| [45] ["That child... has been trapped inside this facility for a long time, hasn't she?"]
 33:  564| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  567| [45] ["!?"]
 35:  572| [45] [Natsuhiko was shocked. How did Kazami know that!?]
 36:  577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  578| [45] [(I thought Ms. Tachibana was unable to use BC--!)]
 38:  583| [45] [As soon as he thought that,]
 39:  588| [45] [a certain thought rose up from the back of Natsuhiko's mind.]
 40:  596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  599| [45] ["Ah...!"]
 42:  605| [45] [Kazami -was- unable to use BC. In the past.]
 43:  610| [45] [Because her aptitude was low.]
 44:  615| [45] [Aptitude was genetic, meaning it normally did not change.]
 45:  620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  621| [45] [(But there's just one circumstance that can overturn that rule!)]
 47:  675| [45] [The same circumstance that Natsuhiko and Yuuri encountered when they sneaked into LABO.]
 48:  727| [45] [An environment filled with WX particles. In other words--]
 49:  735| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  738| [45] ["'The conditions inside this facility today make aptitude increase possible'...!"]
 51:  743| [45] [Everyone gasped at that statement.]
 52:  751| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  754| [45] ["Ms. Tachibana, don't tell me..."]
 54:  762| [47] [Yuuri]
 55:  765| [45] ["... you've awoken to BC!?"]
 56:  850| [47] [Kazami]
 57:  853| [45] ["I have. And just now, you've taught me how to use all of it, Tenkawa."]
 58:  858| [45] [Kazami gave that reply with a smile.]
 59:  863| [45] [A beautiful, yet somehow sinister smile-- one that sent shivers down the spines of all who beheld it.]
 60:  871| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  874| [45] ["B-but still, regardless of how high your aptitude rose... how could you learn Senses Sympathy in such a short time!?"]
 62:  900| [47] [Kazami]
 63:  903| [45] ["This girl here taught me."]
 64:  926| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  929| [45] ["...!"]
 66:  934| [45] [Kazami looked to the empty air beside her as she answered.]
 67:  939| [45] [The phantom Subject N was probably standing right there in her eyes.]
 68:  965| [47] [Kazami]
 69:  968| [45] ["And by reading your memory, I learned everything."]
 70:  994| [47] [Kazami]
 71:  997| [45] ["The cause behind the entire incident and that girl's death..."]
 72: 1023| [47] [Kazami]
 73: 1026| [45] ["So it was Watase after all. And Mr. Ukita as well."]
 74: 1031| [45] [Kazami's clouded eyes were tinged with the glint of murderous intent.]
 75: 1101| [45] [Ena then took her gun out.]
 76: 1109| [47] [Ena]
 77: 1112| [45] ["Ms. Tachibana! Don't move!"]
 78: 1117| [45] [But the very next moment-- a tremendous, brain-shaking voice echoed through the room.]
 79: 1185| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1188| [45] [{Nobody move!!!}]
 81: 1238| [47] [Everyone]
 82: 1241| [45] ["Gghh!!"]
 83: 1246| [45] [Everybody but Kazami screamed at the sound of that voice.]
 84: 1251| [45] [Even Ena cowered and held her head as she struggled to keep her gun trained on Kazami.]
 85: 1256| [45] [That voice was the same technique Natsuhiko had used in self-defense against Watase to stop him in his tracks--]
 86: 1276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1277| [45] [(Brain damage through high-output telepathy!?)]
 88: 1350| [45] [By the time Natsuhiko grasped what had happened, Kazami grabbed Ena's body,]
 89: 1452| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1455| [45] ["Hmmph!"]
 91: 1493| [45] [and hurled her away.]
 92: 1521| [47] [Ena]
 93: 1524| [45] ["Aahh!"]
 94: 1529| [45] [Ena's back slammed into the ground and bounced.]
 95: 1558| [45] [Then, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, Kazami picked up Ena's gun.]
 96: 1582| [45] [She then gazed at the others as they groaned in pain from their headaches.]
 97: 1587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1588| [45] [(Th-this is terrible...! Ms. Tachibana awoke to BC while infected with malice!)]
 99: 1593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1594| [45] [(It's highly possible that connecting my mind to hers will just end with her infecting me with the malice instead...!)]
101: 1599| [45] [Natsuhiko came to the realization of just how absurdly dangerous Kazami was.]
102: 1604| [45] [Extraordinary BC ability. A thoroughly tempered rescue worker physique. And a gun.]
103: 1609| [45] [There was no way for them to win.]
104: 1614| [45] [But Kazami spoke to them.]
105: 1640| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1643| [45] ["I won't kill any of you."]
107: 1651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1654| [45] ["Huh...?"]
109: 1680| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1683| [45] ["My goal lies elsewhere. And it has nothing to do with any of you."]
111: 1691| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1694| [45] ["I won't harm you so long as you don't get in my way."]
113: 1720| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1723| [45] ["Please, protect those girls who are precious to you."]
115: 1731| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1734| [45] ["...!?"]
117: 1739| [45] [Kazami slipped by Natsuhiko in his confusion--]
118: 1767| [45] [--and left the surveillance room.]
119: 1838| [45] [... Leaving only Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and the fallen Ena.]
120: 1843| [45] [Just then, Mashiro spoke up to break them all away from their numb state.]
121: 1869| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 1872| [45] ["Wh... what was that!? What was that just now!?"]
123: 1898| [47] [Mashiro]
124: 1901| [45] ["What does she mean, 'my goal lies elsewhere'!?"]
125: 1906| [45] [Natsuhiko wracked his numbed brain to think.]
126: 1911| [45] [She said she wouldn't kill them, which meant--]
127: 1919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1922| [45] ["She's really going to try and kill Watase!?"]
129: 1948| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1951| [45] ["B-but remember what Lieutenant Tachibana just said?"]
131: 1977| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1980| [45] ["'The cause behind the entire incident... was Watase after all. And Mr. Ukita as well'!"]
133: 2006| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 2009| [45] ["She said that like she was putting the blame on Mr. Ukita too, didn't she!?"]
135: 2017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2020| [45] ["Now that you mention it...!"]
137: 2074| [45] [When Kazami was strangling Watase, she said she had to kill him to "protect his good name".]
138: 2079| [45] [But it seemed like her objective had changed.]
139: 2084| [45] [However, it didn't seem likely that she'd go out of her way to kill Ukita to protect the honor of his name, too.]
140: 2168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2169| [45] [(Think... Why would she target those two!?)]
142: 2174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2175| [45] [(The main thing Watase and Mr. Ukita have in common is that they're both members of Q!)]
144: 2180| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2181| [45] [(Does Ms. Tachibana have a reason to hate Q!?)]
146: 2273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2276| [45] ["No, wait... she also said..."]
148: 2284| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 2287| [45] ["That Watase and Mr. Ukita were behind the cause of that girl's death."]
150: 2313| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 2316| [45] ["R-right..."]
152: 2324| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2327| [45] ["If you connect the dots-- that means Ms. Tachibana's trying to avenge Subject N!?"]
154: 2353| [47] [Mashiro]
155: 2356| [45] ["B-but why!?"]
156: 2382| [47] [Mashiro]
157: 2385| [45] ["How is she related to that Subject N girl!?"]
158: 2390| [45] [When asked that question, Natsuhiko--]
159: 2398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2401| [45] ["Ah..."]
161: 2406| [45] [--finally realized something.]
162: 2565| [45] [--The test subjects' naming scheme followed a very simple rule.]
163: 2762| [45] [And that there was something Subject N herself misunderstood--]
164: 2767| [45] [A quivering voice leaked from Natsuhiko's lips.]
165: 2775| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2778| [45] ["S-so that's what it was...!?"]
167: 2861| [47] [Yuuri]
168: 2864| [45] ["Huh?"]
169: 2872| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2875| [45] ["... I get it now..."]
171: 2883| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2886| [45] ["I've figured out Subject N's true identity."]
173: 2894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2897| [45] ["She wasn't a child born in LABO at all...!"]
175: 2957| [45] [After reaching that epiphany--]
176: 2962| [45] [--Natsuhiko fell into despair at the sheer cruelty of the truth.]
