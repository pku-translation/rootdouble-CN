  0:  111| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
  1:  115| [45] [--But everything was stable for the time being.]
  2:  120| [45] [Now the group had to pull themselves together and continue with the search whether they liked it or not.]
  3:  125| [45] [Watase addressed the others with that thought in mind.]
  4:  139| [47] [Watase]
  5:  142| [45] ["Okay then... it looks like all of us except for Tachibana are here, then."]
  6:  153| [47] [Watase]
  7:  156| [45] ["Our team got here by circling around from Area 5."]
  8:  164| [47] [Watase]
  9:  167| [45] ["Moribe, did your team find anything?"]
 10:  193| [47] [Jun]
 11:  196| [45] ["No... no sign of Yuuri or anyone else, and no AD either."]
 12:  222| [47] [Ena]
 13:  225| [45] ["Yeah, the same goes for an escape route too."]
 14:  233| [47] [Watase]
 15:  236| [45] ["What about you, old man?"]
 16:  262| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  265| [45] ["It's only been 20 minutes since I split up from you guys, hasn't it?%NOf course I didn't find anything."]
 18:  274| [47] [Watase]
 19:  277| [45] ["Our team got here from circling around from Area 6."]
 20:  285| [47] [Watase]
 21:  288| [45] ["Teach, your team find anything?"]
 22:  314| [47] [Ena]
 23:  317| [45] ["No... we couldn't locate Ms. Yuuri or the others, and we didn't see any AD either."]
 24:  325| [47] [Watase]
 25:  328| [45] ["What about you, old man?"]
 26:  354| [47] [Ukita]
 27:  357| [45] ["It's only been 20 minutes since I split up from you guys, hasn't it?%NOf course I didn't find anything."]
 28:  384| [47] [Watase]
 29:  387| [45] ["Our team got here from circling around from Area 6."]
 30:  395| [47] [Watase]
 31:  398| [45] ["Moribe, did your team find anything?"]
 32:  424| [47] [Jun]
 33:  427| [45] ["No... no sign of Yuuri or anyone else, and no AD either."]
 34:  465| [45] [Like always, their search had yielded nothing.]
 35:  473| [47] [Watase]
 36:  476| [45] ["I see... then did any of you notice anything strange?"]
 37:  481| [45] [Watase said that as a way to basically say "did anyone spot Salyu"--]
 38:  486| [45] [But then Jun gave a surprising answer.]
 39:  512| [47] [Jun]
 40:  515| [45] ["Ah, now that you mention it, I did. It's nothing major, but--"]
 41:  523| [47] [Jun]
 42:  526| [45] ["That 'floral scent' has suddenly disappeared for some reason."]
 43:  534| [47] [Watase]
 44:  537| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 45:  542| [45] [Watase was totally confused by her comment.]
 46:  550| [47] [Watase]
 47:  553| [45] ["What 'floral scent'?"]
 48:  579| [47] [Jun]
 49:  582| [45] ["Well, you know, it's been hanging around here and there in the facility.%NYou didn't smell it?"]
 50:  590| [47] [Watase]
 51:  593| [45] ["Wait, was there something like that?"]
 52:  598| [45] [Watase then glanced at Ukita and Ena.]
 53:  624| [47] [Ukita]
 54:  627| [45] ["Ah, now that you mention it, I do recall smelling that."]
 55:  653| [47] [Ena]
 56:  656| [45] ["Huh? Hmm... I don't think I ever did."]
 57:  661| [45] [Two contradicting statements.]
 58:  669| [47] [Watase]
 59:  672| [45] ["...?"]
 60:  677| [45] [It just didn't make sense to Watase.]
 61:  682| [45] [The four of them, plus Kazami and Yuuri, had traveled through the entire facility together, yet Watase and Ena didn't smell anything while Jun and Ukita did.]
 62:  690| [47] [Watase]
 63:  693| [45] ["What are you talking about...? Where did you smell that?"]
 64:  719| [47] [Jun]
 65:  722| [45] ["No, seriously, it's not a big deal, so forget about it."]
 66:  730| [47] [Jun]
 67:  733| [45] ["Anyway, what about you guys? You notice anything?"]
 68:  741| [47] [Watase]
 69:  744| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
 70:  749| [45] [Watase said that and changed his train of thought.]
 71:  757| [47] [Watase]
 72:  760| [45] ["Actually, Teach and I spotted Salyu earlier... but she ran off again."]
 73:  786| [47] [Jun]
 74:  789| [45] ["Again? Why?"]
 75:  797| [47] [Watase]
 76:  800| [45] ["... I don't know."]
 77:  805| [45] [Salyu's words crossed his mind for a moment.]
 78:  810| [45] ["Be careful of that captain. He's a dangerous man."]
 79:  815| [45] [But Ena didn't bring that up, perhaps out of consideration for Watase.]
 80:  841| [47] [Ena]
 81:  844| [45] ["I don't know why she ran off, but she still looked lively from what I could see."]
 82:  852| [47] [Ena]
 83:  855| [45] ["I think she's been regularly giving herself AD."]
 84:  881| [47] [Jun]
 85:  884| [45] ["Yeah, that's a silver lining, that's for sure...!"]
 86:  910| [47] [Ukita]
 87:  913| [45] ["Indeed... that was the one thing I was worried about."]
 88:  918| [45] [Everyone nodded at Ukita's comment.]
 89:  926| [47] [Watase]
 90:  929| [45] ["Though that said, that doesn't necessarily mean she has enough AD."]
 91:  937| [47] [Watase]
 92:  940| [45] ["She probably ran off in the direction of Area 6. Let's look for her together."]
 93:  969| [47] [Jun]
 94:  972| [45] ["What should we do about the Lieutenant?"]
 95:  980| [47] [Watase]
 96:  983| [45] ["I told her to return to the neuroscience laboratory once she'd healed up."]
 97: 1009| [47] [Jun]
 98: 1012| [45] ["Then this is a good opportunity, seeing as how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience lab."]
 99: 1072| [47] [Jun]
100: 1075| [45] ["What should we do about the Lieutenant?"]
101: 1101| [47] [Ena]
102: 1104| [45] ["She said she'd head back to the neuroscience laboratory once she got better."]
103: 1112| [47] [Watase]
104: 1115| [45] ["Then that's perfect, seeing how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience laboratory and all."]
105: 1160| [47] [Ena]
106: 1163| [45] ["What should we do about Ms. Tachibana?"]
107: 1171| [47] [Jun]
108: 1174| [45] ["She said she'd be going back to the neuroscience laboratory once she felt better again."]
109: 1182| [47] [Watase]
110: 1185| [45] ["Then that's perfect, seeing how Area 6 is right next to the neuroscience laboratory and all."]
111: 1211| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1214| [45] ["Then let's continue the search, shall we?"]
113: 1222| [47] [Ena]
114: 1225| [45] ["Yes. Let's get going."]
115: 1230| [45] [The group then started to walk off.]
116: 1338| [45] [Ena was walking in front of the others.]
117: 1343| [45] [She was fiddling around with her PDA, probably to check her map.]
118: 1348| [45] [Watase walked up to her and whispered into her ear.]
119: 1356| [47] [Watase]
120: 1359| [45] ["Teach."]
121: 1472| [47] [Ena]
122: 1475| [45] ["!!"]
123: 1480| [45] [Ena turned around in surprise.]
124: 1485| [45] [She put away her PDA and spoke in a sharp voice.]
125: 1511| [47] [Ena]
126: 1514| [45] ["Don't sneak up on me like that. You scared the living daylights out of me."]
127: 1534| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
128: 1545| [47] [Watase]
129: 1548| [45] ["O-oh, sorry...."]
130: 1556| [47] [Watase]
131: 1559| [45] ["But anyway, I couldn't help but notice you didn't tell Moribe or the old man about what Salyu said."]
132: 1585| [47] [Ena]
133: 1588| [45] ["You fool, of course I didn't. It would just make things unnecessarily complicated."]
134: 1596| [47] [Ena]
135: 1599| [45] ["That's the same reason I didn't tell them about the bomb."]
136: 1607| [47] [Ena]
137: 1610| [45] ["After all, it seems it was my pistol that made everyone so furious."]
138: 1618| [47] [Watase]
139: 1621| [45] ["I see..."]
140: 1647| [47] [Ena]
141: 1650| [45] ["But you know--"]
142: 1658| [47] [Ena]
143: 1661| [45] ["We need to constantly keep that bomb incident and what happened with Ms. Sannomiya in mind."]
144: 1669| [47] [Watase]
145: 1672| [45] ["Huh?"]
146: 1698| [47] [Ena]
147: 1701| [45] ["There must be a reason behind Ms. Sannomiya running away from us that we don't know about."]
148: 1709| [47] [Ena]
149: 1712| [45] ["Someone had to have planted that bomb. That's for sure."]
150: 1720| [47] [Ena]
151: 1723| [45] ["We might overlook something vital if we lower our guards. Something that may cost us our lives."]
152: 1731| [47] [Watase]
153: 1734| [45] ["..."]
154: 1785| [45] [Ena was speaking with a type of intensity that she'd never used before.]
155: 1790| [45] [A silent edge different from all her backtalk and hysteric shouting could be felt from her.]
156: 1798| [47] [Watase]
157: 1801| [45] ["Teach, what are you...?"]
158: 1827| [47] [Ena]
159: 1830| [45] ["I'm telling you to doubt everything around you."]
160: 1838| [47] [Ena]
161: 1841| [45] ["That includes the people nearby, this facility, and occasionally everything you see.%NYour own preconceptions may be tricking you, after all."]
162: 1857| [47] [Watase]
163: 1860| [45] ["... O-okay... I'll keep that in mind."]
164: 1886| [47] [Ena]
165: 1889| [45] ["Now that's a good boy. That's what I like to see in a student."]
166: 1897| [47] [Watase]
167: 1900| [45] ["I'm not your student, you know..."]
168: 1908| [47] [Ena]
169: 1911| [45] ["But since you don't have any memories, that means I must have more life experience than you do for now."]
170: 1919| [47] [Ena]
171: 1922| [45] ["Maybe this will make me sound arrogant, but just interpret it as your elder's opinion in that case."]
172: 1951| [47] [Watase]
173: 1954| [45] ["... That doesn't sound like something a teacher would say."]
174: 1962| [47] [Ena]
175: 1965| [45] ["Well, teachers are surprisingly suspicious creatures. You can't protect the students you've sworn to keep safe if you trust every little thing."]
176: 1973| [47] [Watase]
177: 1976| [45] ["... Is that true?"]
178: 1984| [47] [Ena]
179: 1987| [45] ["There, that's the spirit. You have to doubt what I say too."]
180: 2032| [45] [The group arrived at Area 6 while they were talking.]
181: 2076| [45] [--Watase began handing out orders once they arrived at the factory.]
182: 2168| [47] [Watase]
183: 2171| [45] ["We're forming up into teams again. Moribe, you're with Teach. Old man, you're with me. Search whatever you can."]
184: 2179| [47] [Watase]
185: 2182| [45] ["Once you're done, return to the neuroscience laboratory for the time being."]
186: 2208| [47] [Jun]
187: 2211| [45] ["... Roger. Then we'll cover the factory, okay?"]
188: 2219| [47] [Ena]
189: 2222| [45] ["... Got it."]
190: 2248| [47] [Ukita]
191: 2251| [45] ["I suppose I have no objections."]
192: 2259| [47] [Watase]
193: 2262| [45] ["All right then, be careful, guys."]
194: 2267| [45] [With those words, Watase then parted ways with Ena's team.]
