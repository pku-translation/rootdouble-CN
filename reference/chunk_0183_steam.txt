  0:   39| [55] [√Before Chapter 5]
  1:   66| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu spoke as they looked at the map posted at the bus stop.]
  2:   74| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   77| [45] ["How do you suppose we search for one girl in a town this big?"]
  4:   85| [47] [Salyu]
  5:   88| [45] ["Have you tried calling her?"]
  6:   96| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:   99| [45] ["Yeah. But she wouldn't pick up."]
  8:  104| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  105| [45] ["..."]
 10:  175| [45] [Salyu pondered for a second before coming up with an answer.]
 11:  201| [47] [Salyu]
 12:  204| [45] ["If you can't reach her by phone, then how about using telepathy?"]
 13:  212| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  215| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 15:  241| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  244| [45] ["When we first met at the scene of that accident, you used powerful telepathy."]
 17:  252| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  255| [45] ["Can't you use that to contact Mashiro without having to know where she is?"]
 19:  263| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  266| [45] ["... Telepathy, huh."]
 21:  271| [45] [According to Ukita, Natsuhiko's telepathy apparently reached as far as a kilometer away.]
 22:  276| [45] [And he knew Mashiro's characteristic brain waveform quite well after all the practice they had done.]
 23:  281| [45] [But Natsuhiko had never consciously used telepathy on his own.]
 24:  289| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  292| [45] ["Can I do it...?"]
 26:  318| [47] [Salyu]
 27:  321| [45] ["Mashiro said that the trick to using telepathy was to focus on the words you want to convey from the bottom of your heart."]
 28:  347| [47] [Salyu]
 29:  350| [45] ["It might be amateurish thinking on my part, but I think you can do it now that you're sincerely worried about Mashiro."]
 30:  358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  361| [45] ["Yeah... maybe I can."]
 32:  369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  372| [45] ["Okay, got it! I'll give it a try!"]
 34:  377| [45] [Natsuhiko resolved himself and placed a finger to his temple.]
 35:  382| [45] [It was the same basic stance Mashiro had used to facilitate telepathy.]
 36:  408| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  411| [45] ["Okay. I'll cheer you on. Go for it, Natsuhiko."]
 38:  419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  422| [45] ["Sorry, please be quiet for a second. I need to concentrate."]
 40:  448| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  451| [45] ["... Okay."]
 42:  463| [45] [Salyu fell silent.]
 43:  468| [45] [In the midst of the soft sound of the pouring rain, Natsuhiko concentrated with all his mind.]
 44:  473| [45] [He couldn't dare use mass untargeted telepathy. He absolutely needed to make sure his message had directionality.]
 45:  478| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  479| [45] [(--First I need to make myself keenly aware of Mashiro's characteristic brain waveform.)]
 47:  530| [45] [Her waveform was Type 2.]
 48:  535| [45] [The waveform associated with gentle people who try their hardest to help others.]
 49:  540| [45] [He thought of her and focused hard on the words he wanted to tell her.]
 50:  545| [45] ["--Mashiro, where are you? Why won't you pick up?"]
 51:  550| [45] ["Salyu and I are worried. Contact us if you're okay."]
 52:  563| [45] [He mentally repeated his message to Mashiro.]
 53:  568| [45] [Though it was embarrassing to put it into words, it was indeed true that he was concerned about her.]
 54:  573| [45] [That concern intensified in his heart.]
 55:  578| [45] ["--Can you hear me, Mashiro?"]
 56:  583| [45] ["Didn't I tell you before not to make me worry so much...?"]
 57:  588| [45] [As he finished wringing out those thoughts, suddenly--]
 58:  596| [45] [He mentally repeated that message over and over.]
 59:  601| [45] [Without thinking about anything else at all.]
 60:  606| [45] [And then suddenly--]
 61:  613| [45] [The surrounding sound of the rain disappeared.]
 62:  618| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  619| [45] [(...?)]
 64:  624| [45] [For a second, he thought the rain had stopped.]
 65:  629| [45] [But that wasn't it. The rain was still falling.]
 66:  634| [45] [He merely stopped hearing the rain because his five senses had dampened.]
 67:  690| [45] [And in place of his sense of hearing, he gained another sense--]
 68:  695| [45] [A strange sixth sense beyond his usual five.]
 69:  700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  701| [45] [(Wh... what's going on?)]
 71:  706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  707| [45] [(It's like I can feel my own brain cranking...!)]
 73:  712| [45] [The world was full to the brim with BC particles.]
 74:  717| [45] [And Natsuhiko felt as if he could sense their very movement through his brain.]
 75:  722| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  723| [45] [(... This...!)]
 77:  728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78:  729| [45] [(This is BC!?)]
 79:  734| [45] [Natsuhiko concentrated even further.]
 80:  739| [45] [He focused on the complex, minute electrical signals that formed his desired message.]
 81:  747| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82:  750| [45] [{--Mashiro, where are you!? Contact me!}]
 83:  801| [45] [The message loaded onto the BC particles in his brain and were expelled out into the world--!]
 84:  806| [45] [----]
 85:  811| [45] [--]
 86:  890| [47] [Salyu]
 87:  893| [45] ["--hiko. Natsuhiko?"]
 88:  898| [45] [Eventually, he snapped back to reality once he heard Salyu's voice.]
 89:  906| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90:  909| [45] ["Huh... what happened?"]
 91:  935| [47] [Salyu]
 92:  938| [45] ["You suddenly turned pale and surprised me. Are you okay?"]
 93:  946| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94:  949| [45] ["Y-yeah, probably."]
 95:  954| [45] [Now that he thought about it, he remembered what Ena had said.]
 96:  959| [45] ["BC use can cause the five senses to dampen, and in certain cases, even vital signs like body temperature and pulse can drop."]
 97:  964| [45] [That said, he hadn't heard a thing about complete hearing loss or turning pale.]
 98:  969| [45] [Perhaps those were side effects of the extreme concentration.]
 99:  977| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100:  980| [45] ["Well, I guess if I was able to concentrate that hard, maybe it actually did reach Mashiro..."]
101:  985| [45] [That would be assuming Mashiro was currently less than a kilometer away from them.]
102:  990| [45] [With that thought in mind, they waited for a little while, but still did not receive any contact from her.]
103:  998| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1001| [45] ["... Maybe it failed."]
105: 1006| [45] [Once that utterance eventually left his lips--]
106: 1017| [45] [An electronic sound chimed from within Natsuhiko's pocket.]
107: 1043| [47] [Salyu]
108: 1046| [45] ["What's that?"]
109: 1054| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1057| [45] ["An e-mail!"]
111: 1068| [45] [Natsuhiko took out his PDA and opened his e-mail.]
112: 1073| [45] [The display showed the following response:]
113: 1110| [45] [Subject: Holy cow...!]
114: 1114| [85] [　]
115: 1117| [45] [Sender: Mashiro Toba]
116: 1121| [85] [　]
117: 1124| [45] [Body:]
118: 1128| [45] [Was that your telepathy, Natsuhiko?]
119: 1132| [45] [So you really can use telepathy now, huh... Congrats!]
120: 1136| [45] [But it's a little disappointing that your first use of telepathy was to send such a cut and dry business-y message.]
121: 1140| [45] [Incidentally, I'm at the White Tiger Gate.]
122: 1144| [45] [I'll go to school once I'm done with my business, so no need to worry.]
123: 1178| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1181| [45] ["The White Tiger Gate...? Why would she be at a place like that?"]
125: 1186| [45] [Natsuhiko cocked his head after he finished reading the e-mail.]
126: 1212| [47] [Salyu]
127: 1215| [45] ["What's that?"]
128: 1224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1227| [45] ["It's a city gate on the west side of town."]
130: 1232| [45] [Rokumei City was surrounded by a fence in order to maintain public security.]
131: 1237| [45] [But obviously, there were entrances in the fence.]
132: 1242| [45] [There were six city gates in total, and the White Tiger Gate was one of them.]
133: 1550| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1553| [45] ["... Your telepathy reached that far?"]
135: 1561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1564| [45] ["Looks like it..."]
137: 1569| [45] [The White Tiger Gate was about 2 km away from where they were.]
138: 1574| [45] [An effective range of 2 km made his latest use of telepathy even more far-reaching than what he did at the scene of the accident.]
139: 1579| [45] [It was hard to believe all of a sudden, but if Mashiro said she heard it, then it was probably true.]
140: 1777| [47] [Salyu]
141: 1780| [45] ["So, what do we do? Mashiro's saying she'll go to school once she's done with her business,%Nso should we meet her there?"]
142: 1788| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1791| [45] ["... No. Let's go to her. I want to know what exactly this business of hers is."]
144: 1817| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1820| [45] ["Roger. I'll accompany you."]
146: 1825| [45] [It was not a distance that was impossible to run.]
147: 1830| [45] [So Natsuhiko and Salyu began running towards the city gate.]
