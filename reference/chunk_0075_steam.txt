  1:    5| [45] [Watase suddenly felt that he had to say something to Kazami.]
  2:   10| [45] [And at that moment-- a memory abruptly resurfaced in his mind.]
  3:   99| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  102| [45] ["H-how does it look?"]
  5:  128| [47] [Kazami]
  6:  131| [45] ["It's been ages since I last wore a skirt... It... doesn't look weird, does it?"]
  7:  139| [47] [Watase]
  8:  142| [45] ["Not at all. It looks really good on you, Kazami."]
  9:  256| [47] [Watase]
 10:  259| [45] ["Wha... what was that memory!?"]
 11:  264| [45] [It'd only been for a second-- but he'd seen himself with Kazami in what appeared to be a park.]
 12:  272| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  275| [45] ["? Did you remember something?"]
 14:  283| [47] [Watase]
 15:  286| [45] ["Well... for some reason, I remembered you wearing a skirt..."]
 16:  334| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  337| [45] ["--Huh!?"]
 18:  345| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  348| [45] ["Could that memory be...!?"]
 20:  356| [47] [Watase]
 21:  359| [45] ["What is it, Tachibana? You know what it was?"]
 22:  367| [47] [Watase]
 23:  370| [45] ["Tell me, what was that memory about?"]
 24:  378| [47] [Kazami]
 25:  381| [45] ["W-well..."]
 26:  389| [47] [Watase]
 27:  392| [45] ["Please! This could the key to unlocking more memories, right?"]
 28:  437| [45] [Kazami started blushing for some reason when she heard Watase's heartfelt plea--]
 29:  445| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  448| [45] ["Why did -that- have to be the one thing you remembered!?"]
 31:  456| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  459| [45] ["That's... that just doesn't feel fair!"]
 33:  467| [47] [Watase]
 34:  470| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean by...?"]
 35:  475| [45] [But at that moment-- Watase turned around in shock.]
 36:  541| [45] [The dark monitor next to him was reflecting his face.]
 37:  599| [45] [He recognized that face. It was the same as the one he'd seen in the photo in Kazami's locket.]
 38:  650| [47] [Watase]
 39:  651| [45] [(N-no way...)]
 40:  696| [47] [Watase]
 41:  697| [45] [(Then that means that memory was...!)]
 42:  709| [47] [Watase]
 43:  712| [45] ["H... hey, Tachibana, were we..."]
 44:  720| [47] [Watase]
 45:  723| [45] ["... going out with each other?"]
 46:  728| [45] [When Watase said that, Kazami--]
 47:  802| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  805| [45] ["... We used to."]
 49:  810| [45] [Confirmed his guess.]
 50:  818| [47] [Watase]
 51:  821| [45] ["'Used to'... then what about now?"]
 52:  829| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  832| [45] ["We broke up a while back."]
 54:  840| [47] [Watase]
 55:  843| [45] ["... I see."]
 56:  848| [45] [Watase had no clue as to what he should say.]
 57:  856| [47] [Kazami]
 58:  859| [45] ["You saw that photo in my locket, right?"]
 59:  867| [47] [Watase]
 60:  870| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 61:  878| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  881| [45] ["The reason your picture is still in there... is just because I can't find the time to take it out, that's all..."]
 63:  886| [45] [Watase didn't press her on that rather flimsy excuse.]
 64:  891| [45] [He decided to ask another question instead.]
 65:  899| [47] [Watase]
 66:  902| [45] ["... Why did we ever break up?"]
 67:  907| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  908| [45] ["..."]
 69:  916| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  919| [45] ["... You and I are very similar."]
 71:  927| [47] [Kazami]
 72:  930| [45] ["It was that part that drew us to each other, but the fact that we were -too- much alike meant that it got too painful for us to be together for long."]
 73:  938| [47] [Kazami]
 74:  941| [45] ["... That's probably why."]
 75:  949| [47] [Watase]
 76:  952| [45] ["I see..."]
 77:  957| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Kazami had mentioned something like that way back then.]
 78:  962| [45] [She'd said that he was an "intellectual rescue worker who always made rational decisions no matter what the crisis".]
 79:  967| [45] [That described Kazami perfectly, so it seemed they really were a lot alike.]
 80:  975| [47] [Watase]
 81:  978| [45] ["But man... I must have been a real dumbass to break up with you."]
 82:  986| [47] [Kazami]
 83:  989| [45] ["Huh?"]
 84:  997| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1000| [45] ["Women as good as you are only come by once in a lifetime, after all."]
 86: 1005| [45] [Those words came instinctively flowing to his mouth straight from the bottom of his heart.]
 87: 1053| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1056| [45] ["Wh... why are you saying that...?"]
 89: 1064| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1067| [45] ["Huh...? Was that weird?"]
 91: 1075| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1078| [45] ["I mean... it doesn't sound like anything you'd ever say."]
 93: 1086| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1089| [45] ["You would never talk that way at all..."]
 95: 1097| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1100| [45] ["... Maybe losing my memories made me a bit more honest?"]
 97: 1108| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1111| [45] ["If that's the case, maybe getting amnesia wasn't such a bad thing after all."]
 99: 1159| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1162| [45] ["No, never say that, not even as a joke...!"]
101: 1170| [47] [Watase]
102: 1173| [45] ["Yeah, I was just kidding. But you know--"]
103: 1181| [47] [Watase]
104: 1184| [45] ["I was being totally serious when I said you were a good woman."]
105: 1192| [47] [Watase]
106: 1195| [45] ["You've saved my life more times than I can count, and you're reliable to a fault."]
107: 1203| [47] [Watase]
108: 1206| [45] ["You're strong, surprisingly kind, and you even show a cute side from time to time..."]
109: 1214| [47] [Watase]
110: 1217| [45] ["... In all honesty, it makes me want to regret that we ever broke up."]
111: 1222| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1223| [45] ["..."]
113: 1278| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1281| [45] ["I'm... very happy... to hear you say that... but..."]
115: 1289| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1292| [45] ["Right now... we need to worry about escaping this place."]
117: 1300| [47] [Watase]
118: 1303| [45] ["R-right."]
119: 1308| [45] [Watase's face tensed up when he said that.]
120: 1313| [45] [He decided to push all that sentimentalism off to a far corner of his heart for now.]
121: 1321| [47] [Watase]
122: 1324| [45] ["... Then I'd better get back to searching now."]
123: 1332| [47] [Kazami]
124: 1335| [45] ["Oh, then I'll come along too."]
