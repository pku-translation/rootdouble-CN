  1:    5| [45] [Watase sighed and looked to Ena.]
  2:   13| [47] [Watase]
  3:   16| [45] ["... Teach..."]
  4:   24| [47] [Ena]
  5:   27| [45] ["Hmm?"]
  6:   35| [47] [Watase]
  7:   38| [45] ["I'm sorry... I failed to rescue your student..."]
  8:   46| [47] [Ena]
  9:   49| [45] ["..."]
 10:   54| [45] [Ena gasped, then smiled.]
 11:   62| [47] [Ena]
 12:   65| [45] ["It's okay... you still risked your life trying."]
 13:   73| [47] [Ena]
 14:   76| [45] ["And besides, knowing that Ms. Sannomiya is in the basement for sure is still progress."]
 15:   84| [47] [Watase]
 16:   87| [45] ["But still, she ran into a contaminated zone... so it's possible she's being exposed to radiation."]
 17:   95| [47] [Ena]
 18:   98| [45] ["Actually, there might be some hope on that front."]
 19:  103| [45] [Ena said that and took something out.]
 20:  148| [45] [It was an empty AD ampule.]
 21:  160| [47] [Watase]
 22:  163| [45] ["What's that?"]
 23:  171| [47] [Ena]
 24:  174| [45] ["It was lying near the staircase."]
 25:  182| [47] [Ena]
 26:  185| [45] ["If Ms. Sannomiya was the one who used it, then that gives her at least some protection."]
 27:  193| [47] [Watase]
 28:  196| [45] ["Then I guess she'll be okay if she stays out of any more contaminated zones, huh..."]
 29:  201| [45] [But he couldn't be optimistic. It was very unlikely that she had a Procyon.]
 30:  206| [45] [Ena continued talking.]
 31:  214| [47] [Ena]
 32:  217| [45] ["... She'll be fine. Truth be told, that girl's a prodigy who excels at almost everything."]
 33:  225| [47] [Watase]
 34:  228| [45] ["A prodigy?"]
 35:  236| [47] [Ena]
 36:  239| [45] ["Right. I just know she's the kind of girl who can figure out a way to survive by herself."]
 37:  247| [47] [Watase]
 38:  250| [45] ["I see... that definitely is... hopeful."]
 39:  255| [45] [Even if it was only a faint hope-- Watase felt he should believe in it.]
 40:  260| [45] [He then continued speaking in order to assuage Ena's concerns even further.]
 41:  268| [47] [Watase]
 42:  271| [45] ["... Still, I've gotta say, you're a great person, Teach."]
 43:  279| [47] [Ena]
 44:  282| [45] ["Now where'd this come from? Just so you know, flattery will get you nowhere."]
 45:  290| [47] [Watase]
 46:  293| [45] ["No, I mean it."]
 47:  301| [47] [Watase]
 48:  304| [45] ["You volunteered to come with us back at the staircase when you saw your student, remember?"]
 49:  312| [47] [Watase]
 50:  315| [45] ["A teacher who was willing to run through a fire just to save her student... is a great person in my book."]
 51:  323| [47] [Ena]
 52:  326| [45] ["That's only because I felt I had to save Ms. Sannomiya as soon as I saw her."]
 53:  334| [47] [Ena]
 54:  337| [45] ["I might have passed out too if I'd actually gone with you... there's nothing great about that. It just means I lack the ability to think things through."]
 55:  345| [47] [Watase]
 56:  348| [45] ["I see... but it's the exact same way with me too, you know?"]
 57:  356| [47] [Ena]
 58:  359| [45] ["Huh?"]
 59:  364| [45] [Ena stared at Watase with an inquisitive glance. He responded by talking about his own experience.]
 60:  372| [47] [Watase]
 61:  375| [45] ["When I first met Yuuri, she was trapped in a sea of flames."]
 62:  383| [47] [Watase]
 63:  386| [45] ["When I saw her like that, I felt I had to save her no matter what, and so I--"]
 64:  394| [47] [Ena]
 65:  397| [45] ["Ran into the fire?"]
 66:  405| [47] [Watase]
 67:  408| [45] ["No, Moribe stopped me right before I could."]
 68:  416| [47] [Ena]
 69:  419| [45] ["Oh my... that was rather reckless of you."]
 70:  427| [47] [Watase]
 71:  430| [45] ["Yeah, let's just say I was being an idiot back there."]
 72:  438| [47] [Watase]
 73:  441| [45] ["Maybe Yuuri's deemed me unreliable because she saw me trying to pull a stupid stunt like that."]
 74:  449| [47] [Watase]
 75:  452| [45] ["Though I guess I'd say she doesn't hate me. More like she doesn't have faith in me... and I've got amnesia on top of all that."]
 76:  457| [45] [Ena gave Watase a wry smile.]
 77:  465| [47] [Ena]
 78:  468| [45] ["I think it'd be best not to worry about it so much. There's just girls out there around Yuuri's age who are scared of all adult men, plain and simple."]
 79:  476| [47] [Watase]
 80:  479| [45] ["I hope that's the case... no wait, that still wouldn't make me happy..."]
 81:  487| [47] [Ena]
 82:  490| [45] ["Just man up."]
 83:  498| [47] [Ena]
 84:  501| [45] ["True, an amnesiac who passes out isn't exactly the most reliable of people, but I know you're trying your best."]
 85:  509| [47] [Ena]
 86:  512| [45] ["I'm sure Yuuri and the others know that too."]
 87:  520| [47] [Watase]
 88:  523| [45] ["Y-you're right. Complaining about it is just pathetic."]
 89:  528| [45] [Watase felt himself getting all pumped up again from Ena's stern encouragement.]
 90:  533| [45] [An intrepid smile then appeared on Ena's face.]
 91:  541| [47] [Ena]
 92:  544| [45] ["There, that's the spirit... by the way, mind if I ask you something?"]
 93:  552| [47] [Watase]
 94:  555| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 95:  563| [47] [Ena]
 96:  566| [45] ["How long do you plan on making me carry you like this?"]
 97:  574| [47] [Watase]
 98:  577| [45] ["Oh... s-sorry!"]
 99:  582| [45] [Watase quickly moved away from Ena as soon as he realized she was still carrying him on her shoulder.]
100:  644| [47] [Watase]
101:  647| [45] ["... Well, anyway, thanks for everything. I feel ready to go again."]
102:  673| [47] [Ena]
103:  676| [45] ["Sure, I'm always up for a lecture like that if you need it. Anyway, let's hurry on over to the control room."]
104:  684| [47] [Watase]
105:  687| [45] ["Yeah."]
106:  692| [45] [Watase and Ena nodded at each other and broke off into a run.]
107:  784| [45] [--By the time they had made it to the door to the control room, Yuuri was already there waiting for them.]
