  0:   15| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 7]
  1:   79| [45] [In the starless darkness--]
  2:   84| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself on the ground.]
  3:   89| [45] [The sound of a watch echoed faintly nearby.]
  4:   94| [45] [Natsuhiko awoke to that sound.]
  5:  102| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  105| [45] ["... Ugh..."]
  7:  113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  116| [45] ["... Wh... where am I...?"]
  9:  166| [45] [He was still in the ruined factory.]
 10:  316| [45] [Apparently, the men had tied him up while he was out cold.]
 11:  321| [45] [Just how much time had passed since he had lost consciousness?]
 12:  326| [45] [As he pondered that question, he heard people groaning beside him.]
 13:  334| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  337| [45] ["... Ugh."]
 15:  345| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  348| [45] ["N... Natsuhiko?"]
 17:  353| [45] [It was Mashiro and Salyu.]
 18:  358| [45] [They had both just woken up, it seemed.]
 19:  472| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  475| [45] ["Ah, guys! Are you okay!?"]
 21:  483| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  486| [45] ["Hmm... I guess I'm okay? I don't hurt anywhere, at least..."]
 23:  494| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  497| [45] ["But it looks like we can't move."]
 25:  505| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  508| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 27:  513| [45] [Natsuhiko finally noticed.]
 28:  524| [45] [His hands and feet were bound by stiff rope.]
 29:  529| [45] [And on closer inspection, Mashiro and Salyu were bound in the same way.]
 30:  537| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  540| [45] ["Ah, what is this!?"]
 32:  548| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  551| [45] ["I think it's to prevent us from escaping."]
 34:  559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  562| [45] ["Mmgh...! Gh...!"]
 36:  567| [45] [No matter how much strength he put into his arms and legs, the ropes wouldn't budge.]
 37:  572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  573| [45] [(Dammit... We need to free ourselves and stop those guys...!)]
 39:  578| [45] [As if in response to Natsuhiko's impatience, a strained cry echoed out from the darkness.]
 40:  583| [47] [Alice]
 41:  586| [45] ["Kyuu~...!"]
 42:  594| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  597| [45] ["Ah, they didn't break Alice... Thank goodness."]
 44:  605| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  608| [45] ["Alice, over here."]
 46:  652| [47] [Alice]
 47:  655| [45] ["Kyuu kyuu!"]
 48:  660| [45] [Alice ran over to Salyu as if in response to her voice.]
 49:  668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  671| [45] ["... Hmm, wait. Alice can walk on her own?"]
 51:  679| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  682| [45] ["It's a simple feature, but yes. She can walk in accordance to voice commands or by inputting route data."]
 53:  690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  693| [45] ["I see...! Then can we get Alice to bring us something we can use to cut the ropes?"]
 55:  701| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  704| [45] ["Ah, didn't think of that."]
 57:  709| [45] [After looking around, they spotted some glass shards scattered on the ground beneath the window.]
 58:  717| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  720| [45] ["Okay, Alice. Start command."]
 60:  728| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  731| [45] ["Go forward 15 m, pick up the glass shard there, and return to current position. End command."]
 62:  736| [47] [Alice]
 63:  739| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
 64:  783| [45] [Alice responded confidently and headed to the window.]
 65:  788| [45] [She spent a moment there looking for the object Salyu commanded her to find--]
 66:  793| [45] [--and eventually, she came back with a shard of glass in her mouth.]
 67:  837| [47] [Alice]
 68:  840| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
 69:  848| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  851| [45] ["You did it! Good girl, Alice!"]
 71:  856| [45] [Natsuhiko twisted himself around to take the glass shard from Alice.]
 72:  864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  867| [45] ["Hang on a second guys, I'll get myself free so I can cut your ropes..."]
 74:  872| [45] [Natsuhiko pressed the rope against the shard as hard as he could-- ]
 75:  921| [45] [--and somehow, he managed to cut his hands and feet free of the rope.]
 76:  929| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  932| [45] ["All right!"]
 78:  937| [45] [He then he cut Mashiro and Salyu free too.]
 79: 1038| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1041| [45] ["Whew... Finally free."]
 81: 1058| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1061| [45] ["Thank you, Natsuhiko."]
 83: 1066| [45] [The girls also appeared to be uninjured after all.]
 84: 1071| [45] [Apparently the terrorist's goal here was only to entrap the kids and nothing more.]
 85: 1097| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1100| [45] ["... But still, I do not understand the terrorists' intentions."]
 87: 1108| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1111| [45] ["There shouldn't have been any point in leaving us alive..."]
 89: 1119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1122| [45] ["No, their target is LABO, after all. They were probably afraid they'd draw too much attention if they killed us."]
 91: 1148| [47] [Mashiro]
 92: 1151| [45] ["How can you tell?"]
 93: 1159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1162| [45] ["I heard it from them directly. From their mental voices, that is."]
 95: 1188| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1191| [45] ["You heard their mental voices? With empathy?"]
 97: 1199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1202| [45] ["Yeah, probably..."]
 99: 1207| [45] [Even though he thought it was empathy, something still felt off about it to Natsuhiko.]
100: 1212| [45] [The ability Natsuhiko activated right before he fainted-- seemed a little different from empathy.]
101: 1217| [45] [Not only did he hear a voice, but he also saw a vision. Was that still empathy?]
102: 1222| [45] [But then he recalled the words he had once heard Ena say.]
103: 1309| [47] [Ena]
104: 1312| [45] ["The possibilities of BC are endless."]
105: 1320| [47] [Ena]
106: 1323| [45] ["Who knows? One day you may find a third ability beyond that of telepathy or empathy."]
107: 1421| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1422| [45] [(A third ability...!?)]
109: 1427| [45] [That was a possibility.]
110: 1432| [45] [Natsuhiko's BC ability was rapidly growing these last few days.]
111: 1437| [45] [Though he had yet to master either telepathy or empathy, he had become able to use both abilities within just a few days.]
112: 1442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1443| [45] [(Could it really be...?)]
114: 1448| [45] [But there was no time to stop and consider the possibility.]
115: 1453| [45] [Right now, the information he gained from that ability was far more important than the ability itself.]
116: 1461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1464| [45] ["... Anyway, according to their mental voices, it looks like it's true that they're targeting LABO."]
118: 1472| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1475| [45] ["And to make matters worse, D-day is today...!"]
120: 1501| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1504| [45] ["Today!? Th-then we gotta stop them!"]
122: 1530| [47] [Salyu]
123: 1533| [45] ["But how? Even if we report it to the authorities, we likely won't get any different results than yesterday."]
124: 1541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1544| [45] ["That's for sure...!"]
126: 1599| [45] [Even if they explained everything to the security department and the police, it seemed highly unlikely that they'd make it in time.]
127: 1604| [45] [Natsuhiko silently pondered.]
128: 1609| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1610| [45] [(Should we go directly to LABO and tip them off there...?)]
130: 1615| [45] [But that would be dangerous.]
131: 1620| [45] [There was a high probability that Q had a sleeper agent there. They could very well wind up caught in the terrorist attack themselves.]
132: 1625| [45] [That would almost certainly get them killed--!]
133: 1630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1631| [45] [(... In that case...)]
135: 1636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1637| [45] [(Shouldn't we run for it as soon as possible...?)]
137: 1642| [45] [He could bring Mashiro and Salyu straight home so they could take Yuuri out of the city.]
138: 1647| [45] [That seemed to be the most proper course of action to him.]
139: 1652| [45] [It would be a different story if it were just him, but there was no way he could expose the girls to danger.]
140: 1657| [45] [However--]
141: 1662| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1663| [45] [(But then I'd be abandoning all the people in town.)]
143: 1668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1669| [45] [(Is it okay to ignore all the people we don't know...?)]
145: 1674| [45] [He always had.]
146: 1679| [45] [That was what Natsuhiko's life had taught him.]
147: 1684| [45] [He didn't care about the the fires, the accidents, or the violent events he saw on the news on TV.]
148: 1689| [45] [They had nothing to do with him at all. They weren't important.]
149: 1694| [45] [Pretty much the only people important to him were himself, Yuuri, and perhaps Mashiro and Salyu too.]
150: 1699| [45] [That's what he had always thought...]
151: 1704| [45] [But in the back of his mind, he thought about all those people in town who had "nothing to do with him at all".]
152: 1709| [45] [The classmates he had associated with at a distance.]
153: 1714| [45] [The childhood friends who had left him after learning he was a Communicator.]
154: 1719| [45] [And Ena, who would not open her heart to them.]
155: 1724| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1725| [45] [(... Dammit, what does that all even matter?)]
157: 1730| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1731| [45] [(If the nuclear reactor melts down, everyone will die, won't they?)]
159: 1736| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 1737| [45] [(This town will become uninhabitable, won't it?)]
161: 1742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1743| [45] [(Which means that the obvious choice of action is to prioritize our own escape, isn't it...!?)]
163: 1748| [45] [But right then, suddenly--]
164: 1753| [45] [The memories of various statements Natsuhiko had heard recently came echoing back into his mind.]
165: 1842| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 1845| [45] ["But Hikorin, you might regret not doing anything."]
167: 1952| [47] [Jun]
168: 1955| [45] ["And I'm gonna protect this town my way. So you guys do whatever it is you can. Capisce?"]
169: 2033| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 2036| [45] ["Overcome the past. I'm sure you can do it, Hikorin."]
171: 2178| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2179| [45] [(...!)]
173: 2184| [45] [And then, Natsuhiko realized.]
174: 2189| [45] [Even if they tried to escape now, that wouldn't necessarily mean they could.]
175: 2194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2195| [45] [(Even residents need to go through strict checks and procedures to come in and out of the city...)]
177: 2200| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2201| [45] [(Can I still take Yuuri out of the city despite that?)]
179: 2206| [45] [It seemed difficult.]
180: 2211| [45] [He could go to LABO or he could try to escape. They were in danger regardless.]
181: 2216| [45] [In that case--]
182: 2221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2222| [45] [(I should go to LABO...!)]
184: 2227| [45] [Natsuhiko surprised himself with the conclusion he came to.]
185: 2232| [45] [But his convictions only grew stronger.]
186: 2237| [45] [Nine years ago, Natsuhiko and Yuuri went to LABO and got into an accident.]
187: 2242| [45] [The fear he felt that fateful day had yet to fade.]
188: 2247| [45] [He might face death once more. He might lose something precious.]
189: 2252| [45] [But that was no reason to stop.]
190: 2257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2258| [45] [(I have to go, don't I, Yuuri...?)]
192: 2263| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2264| [45] [(Or else I'll never be able to overcome the past.)]
194: 2282| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Mashiro gasped.]
195: 2308| [47] [Mashiro]
196: 2311| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, don't tell me..."]
197: 2319| [47] [Mashiro]
198: 2322| [45] ["You're not planning on going to LABO right now, are you?"]
199: 2345| [47] [Natsuhiko & Salyu]
200: 2348| [45] ["!?"]
201: 2353| [45] [Both Natsuhiko and Salyu's eyes opened wide at those words.]
202: 2361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2364| [45] ["How did you!?"]
204: 2390| [47] [Salyu]
205: 2393| [45] ["Did you use empathy?"]
206: 2419| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 2422| [45] ["I can tell even without using it... We've been together for so long, after all."]
208: 2427| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2428| [45] [(I see... there's no hiding it from Mashiro, huh...)]
210: 2433| [45] [Natsuhiko answered her with a smile of resignation.]
211: 2441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 2444| [45] ["... Say, Mashiro. I finally understand how you felt three nights ago."]
213: 2470| [47] [Mashiro]
214: 2473| [45] ["Huh?"]
215: 2481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2484| [45] ["Nobody in the whole town knows that a terrorist attack will happen at LABO today besides us."]
217: 2492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2495| [45] ["This situation... kind of makes you feel a sense of obligation, doesn't it?"]
219: 2521| [47] [Mashiro]
220: 2524| [45] ["..."]
221: 2532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2535| [45] ["... If I don't do something, the city's good as gone."]
223: 2543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2546| [45] ["This isn't some event happening on the other side of the TV. This has everything to do with us--"]
225: 2554| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2557| [45] ["So I really do have to go."]
227: 2562| [45] [He had thought that by avoiding danger, he could live in peace.]
228: 2567| [45] [But no matter how much he'd try to avoid the danger, his peace would crumble.]
229: 2572| [45] [And as Natsuhiko finally realized that, Salyu softly spoke up.]
230: 2598| [47] [Salyu]
231: 2601| [45] ["... Even if you go to LABO, you might not be able to do anything."]
232: 2609| [47] [Salyu]
233: 2612| [45] ["Even if you warn the security officials, there's a high possibility that they won't believe you."]
234: 2620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2623| [45] ["But if I don't go, I'm sure I'll regret it."]
236: 2631| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2634| [45] ["I don't want to have any more regrets."]
238: 2639| [45] [Natsuhiko had built up countless regrets prior to today.]
239: 2644| [45] [Countless times he thought "If only we hadn't gone to LABO that day...]
240: 2649| [45] [But now it was the opposite.]
241: 2654| [45] [He would regret it if he didn't go to LABO.]
242: 2680| [47] [Mashiro]
243: 2683| [45] ["Then we'll come too--"]
244: 2691| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 2694| [45] ["No, there's no need for you two to come. I'll be fine by myself."]
246: 2720| [47] [Salyu]
247: 2723| [45] ["Then what do we do?"]
248: 2731| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 2734| [45] ["I've got a favor to ask."]
250: 2742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 2745| [45] ["Go home right away and take Yuuri as far away as possible."]
252: 2771| [47] [Mashiro]
253: 2774| [45] ["..."]
254: 2782| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 2785| [45] ["Make her come with you, even if she screams and cries."]
256: 2793| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 2796| [45] ["In case the worst happens...!"]
258: 2801| [45] [Natsuhiko looked the girls in the eye.]
259: 2806| [45] [But Mashiro-- Mashiro glared back at him.]
260: 2832| [47] [Mashiro]
261: 2835| [45] ["... Don't give me that."]
262: 2843| [47] [Mashiro]
263: 2846| [45] ["You expect me to go home now, after all we've been through, just because you tell me to?"]
264: 2854| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 2857| [45] ["Huh...?"]
266: 2865| [47] [Mashiro]
267: 2868| [45] ["Nine years ago, you and Yuuri got into an accident at LABO, didn't you?"]
268: 2894| [47] [Mashiro]
269: 2897| [45] ["Do you have any idea how it felt for me?"]
270: 2923| [47] [Mashiro]
271: 2926| [45] ["I regretted not stopping you so badly that I wanted to die."]
272: 2934| [47] [Mashiro]
273: 2937| [45] ["Not even you can be dense enough to not realize that, can you?"]
274: 2945| [47] [Natsuhiko]
275: 2948| [45] ["...!"]
276: 2974| [47] [Mashiro]
277: 2977| [45] ["Even now I want to stop you... If we're going to run away, then I want you to run away with us!"]
278: 3003| [47] [Mashiro]
279: 3006| [45] ["But there's no stopping you, is there, Natsuhiko? You won't give up on going to LABO no matter what, will you!? It's the same as nine years ago!"]
280: 3011| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 3012| [45] ["..."]
282: 3038| [47] [Mashiro]
283: 3041| [45] ["So in that case... In that case, at least let me go with you."]
284: 3067| [47] [Mashiro]
285: 3070| [45] ["You say you don't want to have any more regrets? Well neither do I...!"]
286: 3075| [45] [Mashiro's voice was trembling.]
287: 3080| [45] [Those were probably words that Mashiro had kept locked inside her heart for years.]
288: 3088| [47] [Natsuhiko]
289: 3091| [45] ["But Mashiro, that's still...!"]
290: 3096| [45] [When Natsuhiko still persisted on stopping Mashiro from joining him, Salyu sighed and spoke up.]
291: 3122| [47] [Salyu]
292: 3125| [45] ["I agree with Mashiro. Nothing we say can stop you, Natsuhiko."]
293: 3133| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 3136| [45] ["Huh?"]
295: 3144| [47] [Salyu]
296: 3147| [45] ["You always say you're trying to avoid danger, but whenever it involves Mashiro or Yuuri, you break that oath all too easily."]
297: 3155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
298: 3158| [45] ["N-no, that's, well..."]
299: 3184| [47] [Salyu]
300: 3187| [45] ["That contradictory demeanor of yours is unmanageable. I've become painfully aware of that these past few days."]
301: 3213| [47] [Salyu]
302: 3216| [45] ["Since it's pointless to stop you, you leave me no choice. I'll go with you too."]
303: 3221| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped at those words.]
304: 3229| [47] [Natsuhiko]
305: 3232| [45] ["H-hey, what are you saying!? Were you not listening?"]
306: 3258| [47] [Mashiro]
307: 3261| [45] ["Y-yeah, it's going to be dangerous, you know!?"]
308: 3269| [47] [Mashiro]
309: 3272| [45] ["I have a 9-year score to settle, but why do you have to come with us too, Salyu?"]
310: 3298| [47] [Salyu]
311: 3301| [45] ["No, it's actually only obvious that I go."]
312: 3327| [47] [Salyu]
313: 3330| [45] ["If you two go to LABO alone, you'll have no way to deal with the terrorists if you come across them. Am I wrong?"]
314: 3338| [47] [Natsuhiko]
315: 3341| [45] ["Mmph..."]
316: 3367| [47] [Mashiro]
317: 3370| [45] ["Well, true, but... the terrorists were able to KO you last night, weren't they...?"]
318: 3396| [47] [Salyu]
319: 3399| [45] ["That's right. My regret is last night."]
320: 3407| [47] [Salyu]
321: 3410| [45] ["If I had defeated them, we wouldn't be having this much of a problem now."]
322: 3436| [47] [Salyu]
323: 3439| [45] ["So I'm going too. End of discussion. You cannot change my mind."]
324: 3465| [47] [Salyu]
325: 3468| [45] ["Besides, above all else-- my duty is to protect you, Natsuhiko."]
326: 3473| [45] [Salyu spoke in one breath. In the same, level-headed tone she used when they had first met.]
327: 3478| [45] [But between the lines, Mashiro and Natsuhiko could tell that she was worried about them.]
328: 3486| [47] [Natsuhiko]
329: 3489| [45] ["Aagh, geez... How can you two be so stubborn...!?"]
330: 3494| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu threw Natsuhiko's vitriol back at him.]
331: 3520| [47] [Mashiro]
332: 3523| [45] ["I don't want to hear it from you, Natsuhiko. The three of us just have the same idea in mind."]
333: 3549| [47] [Salyu]
334: 3552| [45] ["Total agreement."]
335: 3557| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly at their words.]
336: 3562| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 3563| [45] [(I guess there's no stopping you two either, huh...!)]
338: 3568| [45] [He was headed towards a terrorist target with two girls as his only allies.]
339: 3573| [45] [It was quite an absurd proposition and an extremely dangerous one at that.]
340: 3578| [45] [And yet Natsuhiko was starting to feel that he was okay with it.]
341: 3583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 3584| [45] [(Dammit, why...?)]
343: 3589| [47] [Natsuhiko]
344: 3590| [45] [(My fear from 9 years ago hadn't faded after all those years...)]
345: 3595| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 3596| [45] [(So why is it only softening now that I know I've got these two by my side?)]
347: 3601| [45] [He was beginning to understand how Mashiro felt more and more.]
348: 3606| [45] [How the simple notion that he was not alone was so encouraging.]
349: 3611| [45] [Natsuhiko grinned at the girls and spoke in a deliberately cheerful voice.]
350: 3619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
351: 3622| [45] ["... Okay, okay, you win, guys! I concede!"]
352: 3648| [47] [Mashiro]
353: 3651| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you mean!?"]
354: 3659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
355: 3662| [45] ["I can't waste any time arguing here, so I've got no choice but to take you two with me!"]
356: 3688| [47] [Mashiro]
357: 3691| [45] ["... Hey, what's with the attitude!?"]
358: 3717| [47] [Salyu]
359: 3720| [45] ["You're weaker than me, you know..."]
360: 3728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 3731| [45] ["Hahah, you got me there!"]
362: 3736| [45] [Though he was laughing, Natsuhiko swore to himself.]
363: 3741| [45] [That no matter what happened from here on out, he'd protect these two.]
364: 3746| [45] [He was physically weaker than Salyu, and he was less skilled with BC than Mashiro.]
365: 3751| [45] [So protecting them was the only way he could repay them for the courage they provided him.]
366: 3759| [47] [Natsuhiko]
367: 3762| [45] ["... Okay, then. Ready, guys?"]
368: 3788| [47] [Salyu]
369: 3791| [45] ["Roger."]
370: 3817| [47] [Mashiro]
371: 3820| [45] ["Mmm, I'm ready to go when you are."]
372: 3828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 3831| [45] ["Let's go, to protect the city...!"]
374: 3836| [45] [The kids nodded at each other and dashed off.]
