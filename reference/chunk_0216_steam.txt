  0:   53| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 7]
  1:  117| [45] [In the starless darkness--]
  2:  122| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself on the ground.]
  3:  127| [45] [The sound of a watch echoed faintly nearby.]
  4:  132| [45] [Natsuhiko awoke to that sound.]
  5:  140| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  143| [45] ["... Ugh..."]
  7:  151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  154| [45] ["... Wh... where am I...?"]
  9:  204| [45] [He was still in the ruined factory.]
 10:  354| [45] [Apparently, the men had tied him up while he was out cold.]
 11:  359| [45] [Just how much time had passed since he had lost consciousness?]
 12:  364| [45] [As he pondered that question, he heard people groaning beside him.]
 13:  372| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  375| [45] ["... Ugh."]
 15:  383| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  386| [45] ["N... Natsuhiko?"]
 17:  391| [45] [It was Mashiro and Salyu.]
 18:  396| [45] [They had both just woken up, it seemed.]
 19:  510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  513| [45] ["Ah, guys! Are you okay!?"]
 21:  521| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  524| [45] ["Hmm... I guess I'm okay? I don't hurt anywhere, at least..."]
 23:  532| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  535| [45] ["But it looks like we can't move."]
 25:  543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  546| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 27:  551| [45] [Natsuhiko finally noticed.]
 28:  562| [45] [His hands and feet were bound by stiff rope.]
 29:  567| [45] [And on closer inspection, Mashiro and Salyu were bound in the same way.]
 30:  575| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  578| [45] ["Ah, what is this!?"]
 32:  586| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  589| [45] ["I think it's to prevent us from escaping."]
 34:  597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  600| [45] ["Mmgh...! Gh...!"]
 36:  605| [45] [No matter how much strength he put into his arms and legs, the ropes wouldn't budge.]
 37:  610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  611| [45] [(Dammit... We need to free ourselves and stop those guys...!)]
 39:  616| [45] [As if in response to Natsuhiko's impatience, a strained cry echoed out from the darkness.]
 40:  621| [47] [Alice]
 41:  624| [45] ["Kyuu~...!"]
 42:  632| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  635| [45] ["Ah, they didn't break Alice... Thank goodness."]
 44:  643| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  646| [45] ["Alice, over here."]
 46:  690| [47] [Alice]
 47:  693| [45] ["Kyuu kyuu!"]
 48:  698| [45] [Alice ran over to Salyu as if in response to her voice.]
 49:  706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  709| [45] ["... Hmm, wait. Alice can walk on her own?"]
 51:  717| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  720| [45] ["It's a simple feature, but yes. She can walk in accordance to voice commands or by inputting route data."]
 53:  728| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  731| [45] ["I see...! Then can we get Alice to bring us something we can use to cut the ropes?"]
 55:  739| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  742| [45] ["Ah, didn't think of that."]
 57:  747| [45] [After looking around, they spotted some glass shards scattered on the ground beneath the window.]
 58:  755| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  758| [45] ["Okay, Alice. Start command."]
 60:  766| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  769| [45] ["Go forward 15 m, pick up the glass shard there, and return to current position. End command."]
 62:  774| [47] [Alice]
 63:  777| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
 64:  821| [45] [Alice responded confidently and headed to the window.]
 65:  826| [45] [She spent a moment there looking for the object Salyu commanded her to find--]
 66:  831| [45] [--and eventually, she came back with a shard of glass in her mouth.]
 67:  875| [47] [Alice]
 68:  878| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
 69:  886| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  889| [45] ["You did it! Good girl, Alice!"]
 71:  894| [45] [Natsuhiko twisted himself around to take the glass shard from Alice.]
 72:  902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  905| [45] ["Hang on a second guys, I'll get myself free so I can cut your ropes..."]
 74:  910| [45] [Natsuhiko pressed the rope against the shard as hard as he could-- ]
 75:  959| [45] [--and somehow, he managed to cut his hands and feet free of the rope.]
 76:  967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  970| [45] ["All right!"]
 78:  975| [45] [He then he cut Mashiro and Salyu free too.]
 79: 1076| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1079| [45] ["Whew... Finally free."]
 81: 1096| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1099| [45] ["Thank you, Natsuhiko."]
 83: 1104| [45] [The girls also appeared to be uninjured after all.]
 84: 1109| [45] [Apparently the terrorist's goal here was only to entrap the kids and nothing more.]
 85: 1135| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1138| [45] ["... But still, I do not understand the terrorists' intentions."]
 87: 1146| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1149| [45] ["There shouldn't have been any point in leaving us alive..."]
 89: 1157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1160| [45] ["No, their target is LABO, after all. They were probably afraid they'd draw too much attention if they killed us."]
 91: 1186| [47] [Mashiro]
 92: 1189| [45] ["How can you tell?"]
 93: 1197| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1200| [45] ["I heard it from them directly. From their mental voices, that is."]
 95: 1226| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 1229| [45] ["You heard their mental voices? With empathy?"]
 97: 1237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1240| [45] ["Yeah, probably..."]
 99: 1245| [45] [Even though he thought it was empathy, something still felt off about it to Natsuhiko.]
100: 1250| [45] [The ability Natsuhiko activated right before he fainted-- seemed a little different from empathy.]
101: 1255| [45] [Not only did he hear a voice, but he also saw a vision. Was that still empathy?]
102: 1260| [45] [But then he recalled the words he had once heard Ena say.]
103: 1347| [47] [Ena]
104: 1350| [45] ["The possibilities of BC are endless."]
105: 1358| [47] [Ena]
106: 1361| [45] ["Who knows? One day you may find a third ability beyond that of telepathy or empathy."]
107: 1459| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1460| [45] [(A third ability...!?)]
109: 1465| [45] [That was a possibility.]
110: 1470| [45] [Natsuhiko's BC ability was rapidly growing these last few days.]
111: 1475| [45] [Though he had yet to master either telepathy or empathy, he had become able to use both abilities within just a few days.]
112: 1480| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 1481| [45] [(Could it really be...?)]
114: 1486| [45] [But there was no time to stop and consider the possibility.]
115: 1491| [45] [Right now, the information he gained from that ability was far more important than the ability itself.]
116: 1499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1502| [45] ["... Anyway, according to their mental voices, it looks like it's true that they're targeting LABO."]
118: 1510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1513| [45] ["And to make matters worse, D-day is today...!"]
120: 1539| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1542| [45] ["Today!? Th-then we gotta stop them!"]
122: 1568| [47] [Salyu]
123: 1571| [45] ["But how? Even if we report it to the authorities, we likely won't get any different results than yesterday."]
124: 1579| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1582| [45] ["That's for sure...!"]
126: 1637| [45] [Even if they explained everything to the security department and the police, it seemed highly unlikely that they'd make it in time.]
127: 1642| [45] [Natsuhiko silently pondered.]
128: 1647| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1648| [45] [(Should we go directly to LABO and tip them off there...?)]
130: 1653| [45] [But that would be dangerous.]
131: 1658| [45] [There was a high probability that Q had a sleeper agent there. They could very well wind up caught in the terrorist attack themselves.]
132: 1663| [45] [That would almost certainly get them killed--!]
133: 1668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1669| [45] [(... In that case...)]
135: 1674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1675| [45] [(Shouldn't we run for it as soon as possible...?)]
137: 1680| [45] [He could bring Mashiro and Salyu straight home so they could take Yuuri out of the city.]
138: 1685| [45] [That seemed to be the most proper course of action to him.]
139: 1690| [45] [It would be a different story if it were just him, but there was no way he could expose the girls to danger.]
140: 1695| [45] [However--]
141: 1700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1701| [45] [(But then I'd be abandoning all the people in town.)]
143: 1706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1707| [45] [(Is it okay to ignore all the people we don't know...?)]
145: 1712| [45] [He always had.]
146: 1717| [45] [That was what Natsuhiko's life had taught him.]
147: 1722| [45] [He didn't care about the the fires, the accidents, or the violent events he saw on the news on TV.]
148: 1727| [45] [They had nothing to do with him at all. They weren't important.]
149: 1732| [45] [Pretty much the only people important to him were himself, Yuuri, and perhaps Mashiro and Salyu too.]
150: 1737| [45] [That's what he had always thought...]
151: 1742| [45] [But in the back of his mind, he thought about all those people in town who had "nothing to do with him at all".]
152: 1747| [45] [The classmates he had associated with at a distance.]
153: 1752| [45] [The childhood friends who had left him after learning he was a Communicator.]
154: 1757| [45] [And Ena, who would not open her heart to them.]
155: 1762| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 1763| [45] [(... Dammit, what does that all even matter?)]
157: 1768| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1769| [45] [(If the nuclear reactor melts down, everyone will die, won't they?)]
159: 1774| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 1775| [45] [(This town will become uninhabitable, won't it?)]
161: 1780| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1781| [45] [(Which means that the obvious choice of action is to prioritize our own escape, isn't it...!?)]
163: 1786| [45] [But right then, suddenly--]
164: 1791| [45] [The memories of various statements Natsuhiko had heard recently came echoing back into his mind.]
165: 1880| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 1883| [45] ["But Hikorin, you might regret not doing anything."]
167: 1990| [47] [Jun]
168: 1993| [45] ["And I'm gonna protect this town my way. So you guys do whatever it is you can. Capisce?"]
169: 2071| [47] [Yuuri]
170: 2074| [45] ["Overcome the past. I'm sure you can do it, Hikorin."]
171: 2216| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 2217| [45] [(...!)]
173: 2222| [45] [And then, Natsuhiko realized.]
174: 2227| [45] [Even if they tried to escape now, that wouldn't necessarily mean they could.]
175: 2232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2233| [45] [(Even residents need to go through strict checks and procedures to come in and out of the city...)]
177: 2238| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2239| [45] [(Can I still take Yuuri out of the city despite that?)]
179: 2244| [45] [It seemed difficult.]
180: 2249| [45] [He could go to LABO or he could try to escape. They were in danger regardless.]
181: 2254| [45] [In that case--]
182: 2259| [47] [Natsuhiko]
183: 2260| [45] [(I should go to LABO...!)]
184: 2265| [45] [Natsuhiko surprised himself with the conclusion he came to.]
185: 2270| [45] [But his convictions only grew stronger.]
186: 2275| [45] [Nine years ago, Natsuhiko and Yuuri went to LABO and got into an accident.]
187: 2280| [45] [The fear he felt that fateful day had yet to fade.]
188: 2285| [45] [He might face death once more. He might lose something precious.]
189: 2290| [45] [But that was no reason to stop.]
190: 2295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2296| [45] [(I have to go, don't I, Yuuri...?)]
192: 2301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2302| [45] [(Or else I'll never be able to overcome the past.)]
194: 2320| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Mashiro gasped.]
195: 2346| [47] [Mashiro]
196: 2349| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, don't tell me..."]
197: 2357| [47] [Mashiro]
198: 2360| [45] ["You're not planning on going to LABO right now, are you?"]
199: 2383| [47] [Natsuhiko & Salyu]
200: 2386| [45] ["!?"]
201: 2391| [45] [Both Natsuhiko and Salyu's eyes opened wide at those words.]
202: 2399| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2402| [45] ["How did you!?"]
204: 2428| [47] [Salyu]
205: 2431| [45] ["Did you use empathy?"]
206: 2457| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 2460| [45] ["I can tell even without using it... We've been together for so long, after all."]
208: 2465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2466| [45] [(I see... there's no hiding it from Mashiro, huh...)]
210: 2471| [45] [Natsuhiko answered her with a smile of resignation.]
211: 2479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 2482| [45] ["... Say, Mashiro. I finally understand how you felt three nights ago."]
213: 2508| [47] [Mashiro]
214: 2511| [45] ["Huh?"]
215: 2519| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2522| [45] ["Nobody in the whole town knows that a terrorist attack will happen at LABO today besides us."]
217: 2530| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2533| [45] ["This situation... kind of makes you feel a sense of obligation, doesn't it?"]
219: 2559| [47] [Mashiro]
220: 2562| [45] ["..."]
221: 2570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2573| [45] ["... If I don't do something, the city's good as gone."]
223: 2581| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2584| [45] ["This isn't some event happening on the other side of the TV. This has everything to do with us--"]
225: 2592| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2595| [45] ["So I really do have to go."]
227: 2600| [45] [He had thought that by avoiding danger, he could live in peace.]
228: 2605| [45] [But no matter how much he'd try to avoid the danger, his peace would crumble.]
229: 2610| [45] [And as Natsuhiko finally realized that, Salyu softly spoke up.]
230: 2636| [47] [Salyu]
231: 2639| [45] ["... Even if you go to LABO, you might not be able to do anything."]
232: 2647| [47] [Salyu]
233: 2650| [45] ["Even if you warn the security officials, there's a high possibility that they won't believe you."]
234: 2658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2661| [45] ["But if I don't go, I'm sure I'll regret it."]
236: 2669| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2672| [45] ["I don't want to have any more regrets."]
238: 2677| [45] [Natsuhiko had built up countless regrets prior to today.]
239: 2682| [45] [Countless times he thought "If only we hadn't gone to LABO that day...]
240: 2687| [45] [But now it was the opposite.]
241: 2692| [45] [He would regret it if he didn't go to LABO.]
242: 2718| [47] [Mashiro]
243: 2721| [45] ["Then we'll come too--"]
244: 2729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 2732| [45] ["No, there's no need for you two to come. I'll be fine by myself."]
246: 2758| [47] [Salyu]
247: 2761| [45] ["Then what do we do?"]
248: 2769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 2772| [45] ["I've got a favor to ask."]
250: 2780| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 2783| [45] ["Go home right away and take Yuuri as far away as possible."]
252: 2809| [47] [Mashiro]
253: 2812| [45] ["..."]
254: 2820| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 2823| [45] ["Make her come with you, even if she screams and cries."]
256: 2831| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 2834| [45] ["In case the worst happens...!"]
258: 2839| [45] [Natsuhiko looked the girls in the eye.]
259: 2844| [45] [But Mashiro-- Mashiro glared back at him.]
260: 2870| [47] [Mashiro]
261: 2873| [45] ["... Don't give me that."]
262: 2881| [47] [Mashiro]
263: 2884| [45] ["You expect me to go home now, after all we've been through, just because you tell me to?"]
264: 2892| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 2895| [45] ["Huh...?"]
266: 2903| [47] [Mashiro]
267: 2906| [45] ["Nine years ago, you and Yuuri got into an accident at LABO, didn't you?"]
268: 2932| [47] [Mashiro]
269: 2935| [45] ["Do you have any idea how it felt for me?"]
270: 2961| [47] [Mashiro]
271: 2964| [45] ["I regretted not stopping you so badly that I wanted to die."]
272: 2972| [47] [Mashiro]
273: 2975| [45] ["Not even you can be dense enough to not realize that, can you?"]
274: 2983| [47] [Natsuhiko]
275: 2986| [45] ["...!"]
276: 3012| [47] [Mashiro]
277: 3015| [45] ["Even now I want to stop you... If we're going to run away, then I want you to run away with us!"]
278: 3041| [47] [Mashiro]
279: 3044| [45] ["But there's no stopping you, is there, Natsuhiko? You won't give up on going to LABO no matter what, will you!? It's the same as nine years ago!"]
280: 3049| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 3050| [45] ["..."]
282: 3076| [47] [Mashiro]
283: 3079| [45] ["So in that case... In that case, at least let me go with you."]
284: 3105| [47] [Mashiro]
285: 3108| [45] ["You say you don't want to have any more regrets? Well neither do I...!"]
286: 3113| [45] [Mashiro's voice was trembling.]
287: 3118| [45] [Those were probably words that Mashiro had kept locked inside her heart for years.]
288: 3126| [47] [Natsuhiko]
289: 3129| [45] ["But Mashiro, that's still...!"]
290: 3134| [45] [When Natsuhiko still persisted on stopping Mashiro from joining him, Salyu sighed and spoke up.]
291: 3160| [47] [Salyu]
292: 3163| [45] ["I agree with Mashiro. Nothing we say can stop you, Natsuhiko."]
293: 3171| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 3174| [45] ["Huh?"]
295: 3182| [47] [Salyu]
296: 3185| [45] ["You always say you're trying to avoid danger, but whenever it involves Mashiro or Yuuri, you break that oath all too easily."]
297: 3193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
298: 3196| [45] ["N-no, that's, well..."]
299: 3222| [47] [Salyu]
300: 3225| [45] ["That contradictory demeanor of yours is unmanageable. I've become painfully aware of that these past few days."]
301: 3251| [47] [Salyu]
302: 3254| [45] ["Since it's pointless to stop you, you leave me no choice. I'll go with you too."]
303: 3259| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped at those words.]
304: 3267| [47] [Natsuhiko]
305: 3270| [45] ["H-hey, what are you saying!? Were you not listening?"]
306: 3296| [47] [Mashiro]
307: 3299| [45] ["Y-yeah, it's going to be dangerous, you know!?"]
308: 3307| [47] [Mashiro]
309: 3310| [45] ["I have a 9-year score to settle, but why do you have to come with us too, Salyu?"]
310: 3336| [47] [Salyu]
311: 3339| [45] ["No, it's actually only obvious that I go."]
312: 3365| [47] [Salyu]
313: 3368| [45] ["If you two go to LABO alone, you'll have no way to deal with the terrorists if you come across them. Am I wrong?"]
314: 3376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
315: 3379| [45] ["Mmph..."]
316: 3405| [47] [Mashiro]
317: 3408| [45] ["Well, true, but... the terrorists were able to KO you last night, weren't they...?"]
318: 3434| [47] [Salyu]
319: 3437| [45] ["That's right. My regret is last night."]
320: 3445| [47] [Salyu]
321: 3448| [45] ["If I had defeated them, we wouldn't be having this much of a problem now."]
322: 3474| [47] [Salyu]
323: 3477| [45] ["So I'm going too. End of discussion. You cannot change my mind."]
324: 3503| [47] [Salyu]
325: 3506| [45] ["Besides, above all else-- my duty is to protect you, Natsuhiko."]
326: 3511| [45] [Salyu spoke in one breath. In the same, level-headed tone she used when they had first met.]
327: 3516| [45] [But between the lines, Mashiro and Natsuhiko could tell that she was worried about them.]
328: 3524| [47] [Natsuhiko]
329: 3527| [45] ["Aagh, geez... How can you two be so stubborn...!?"]
330: 3532| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu threw Natsuhiko's vitriol back at him.]
331: 3558| [47] [Mashiro]
332: 3561| [45] ["I don't want to hear it from you, Natsuhiko. The three of us just have the same idea in mind."]
333: 3587| [47] [Salyu]
334: 3590| [45] ["Total agreement."]
335: 3595| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled wryly at their words.]
336: 3600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 3601| [45] [(I guess there's no stopping you two either, huh...!)]
338: 3606| [45] [He was headed towards a terrorist target with two girls as his only allies.]
339: 3611| [45] [It was quite an absurd proposition and an extremely dangerous one at that.]
340: 3616| [45] [And yet Natsuhiko was starting to feel that he was okay with it.]
341: 3621| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 3622| [45] [(Dammit, why...?)]
343: 3627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
344: 3628| [45] [(My fear from 9 years ago hadn't faded after all those years...)]
345: 3633| [47] [Natsuhiko]
346: 3634| [45] [(So why is it only softening now that I know I've got these two by my side?)]
347: 3639| [45] [He was beginning to understand how Mashiro felt more and more.]
348: 3644| [45] [How the simple notion that he was not alone was so encouraging.]
349: 3649| [45] [Natsuhiko grinned at the girls and spoke in a deliberately cheerful voice.]
350: 3657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
351: 3660| [45] ["... Okay, okay, you win, guys! I concede!"]
352: 3686| [47] [Mashiro]
353: 3689| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you mean!?"]
354: 3697| [47] [Natsuhiko]
355: 3700| [45] ["I can't waste any time arguing here, so I've got no choice but to take you two with me!"]
356: 3726| [47] [Mashiro]
357: 3729| [45] ["... Hey, what's with the attitude!?"]
358: 3755| [47] [Salyu]
359: 3758| [45] ["You're weaker than me, you know..."]
360: 3766| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 3769| [45] ["Hahah, you got me there!"]
362: 3774| [45] [Though he was laughing, Natsuhiko swore to himself.]
363: 3779| [45] [That no matter what happened from here on out, he'd protect these two.]
364: 3784| [45] [He was physically weaker than Salyu, and he was less skilled with BC than Mashiro.]
365: 3789| [45] [So protecting them was the only way he could repay them for the courage they provided him.]
366: 3797| [47] [Natsuhiko]
367: 3800| [45] ["... Okay, then. Ready, guys?"]
368: 3826| [47] [Salyu]
369: 3829| [45] ["Roger."]
370: 3855| [47] [Mashiro]
371: 3858| [45] ["Mmm, I'm ready to go when you are."]
372: 3866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 3869| [45] ["Let's go, to protect the city...!"]
374: 3874| [45] [The kids nodded at each other and dashed off.]
