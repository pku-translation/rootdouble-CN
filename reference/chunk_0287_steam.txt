  1:   74| [45] [--While Natsuhiko and Yuuri were talking, Watase was concealing himself in the darkness.]
  2:   79| [45] [He'd heard someone's footsteps on his way to the factory, and had quickly found a place to hide.]
  3:   84| [47] [Watase]
  4:   85| [45] [(Dammit, who's there...!?)]
  5:   90| [45] [He couldn't tell whose footsteps they were.]
  6:   95| [45] [Were they Ukita's? Jun's? Kazami's? Or--]
  7:  100| [47] [Watase]
  8:  101| [45] [(No, it's too dangerous for me to bump into anyone right now, no matter who they are.)]
  9:  106| [45] [Watase held his breath and waited for that person to leave.]
 10:  131| [45] [It didn't take long before the footsteps grew fainter and fainter, then disappeared completely.]
 11:  139| [47] [Watase]
 12:  142| [45] ["Phew..."]
 13:  147| [45] [Watase breathed a sigh of relief.]
 14:  152| [45] [If someone spotted him, then it'd cause all sorts of problems with bringing Mashiro Toba back to the secret room.]
 15:  157| [47] [Watase]
 16:  158| [45] [(I have to save that Mashiro girl as fast as I can...)]
 17:  212| [45] [Watase broke off into a dash while keeping his guard up.]
 18:  312| [45] [He headed for the cargo lift room in the corner of the factory.]
 19:  372| [45] [But once he made it there--]
 20:  447| [47] [Watase]
 21:  450| [45] ["...!?"]
 22:  455| [45] [--what he found left him stunned.]
 23:  463| [47] [Watase]
 24:  466| [45] ["... No way! How did...!?"]
 25:  471| [45] [Very little had changed about the room since the last time he'd been there.]
 26:  477| [45] [But there was one part about it that was strange. Very strange.]
 27:  482| [45] [Or rather, it was the lack of something that was strange.]
 28:  534| [45] [--The girl who'd been lying by the lift...]
 29:  539| [45] [The same girl who'd been confirmed dead after Kazami and Jun's failed CPR attempts...]
 30:  589| [45] [... was gone.]
 31:  597| [47] [Watase]
 32:  600| [45] ["... Where did her body go...!?"]
 33:  605| [45] [With this being the second dead body that'd vanished on him that day--]
 34:  610| [45] [--Watase just stood frozen in complete shock.]
