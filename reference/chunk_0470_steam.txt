  0:   81| [45] [--The name of the man who had told Watase the truth at the ruins of the hospital was Keiji Ukita.]
  1:   86| [45] [On that day, he left Watase with the words "if you want to be one of our comrades, then feel free to contact me at any time".]
  2:   91| [45] [Watase wracked his mind over what to do all throughout the next month--]
  3:   96| [45] [--and then finally contacted Ukita.]
  4:  165| [45] [--They secretly met at the same place as last time-- the ruins of the hospital.]
  5:  170| [45] [Watase arrived there shortly after leaving work. Before long, Ukita also showed up with a tense look on his face.]
  6:  209| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  212| [45] ["It's been a long time, Mr. Kasasagi."]
  8:  238| [47] [Ukita]
  9:  241| [45] ["Have you decided to become one of us?"]
 10:  249| [47] [Watase]
 11:  252| [45] ["No... I wanna ask you something before that."]
 12:  278| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  281| [45] ["What is it?"]
 14:  289| [47] [Watase]
 15:  292| [45] ["Why are you betraying LABO?"]
 16:  300| [47] [Watase]
 17:  303| [45] ["I can't trust a man who'd betray his own organization without first hearing a clear reason that I can accept."]
 18:  308| [45] [A bitter look rose to Ukita's face when he heard that question.]
 19:  334| [47] [Ukita]
 20:  337| [45] ["... Because I feel sorry for the confined test subjects. That's all."]
 21:  345| [47] [Watase]
 22:  348| [45] ["What? But aren't you guys the ones who are abducting Communicators and using them for human experimentation?"]
 23:  374| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  377| [45] ["No, that's only done by a small number of employees known as 'Senior Fellows'-- high ranked researchers, in other words."]
 25:  385| [47] [Ukita]
 26:  388| [45] ["Junior Fellows-- normal researchers-- like me know that LABO is a BC research facility, but don't know about the test subjects."]
 27:  414| [47] [Ukita]
 28:  417| [45] ["But I accidentally discovered the truth, you see..."]
 29:  443| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  446| [45] ["If there are inhumane acts being committed at my workplace, then I want to put a stop to them."]
 31:  454| [47] [Watase]
 32:  457| [45] ["Out of a pure sense of justice?"]
 33:  483| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  486| [45] ["Well, something like that."]
 35:  512| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  515| [45] ["After all, not a single worker at LABO has tried to prevent the horrible things going on at their own workplace."]
 37:  541| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  544| [45] ["When no one else will act to correct blatant wrongdoing, it offends your sense of justice, does it not?"]
 39:  552| [47] [Watase]
 40:  555| [45] ["Quite a human reason. Wasn't expecting to hear that from a scientist."]
 41:  581| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  584| [45] ["Contrary to what many think, the majority of scientists are human. That majority just isn't cut out to work at LABO."]
 43:  610| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  613| [45] ["I know it's much more pathetic than your reason-- but is it acceptable to you?"]
 45:  618| [47] [Watase]
 46:  619| [45] ["..."]
 47:  627| [47] [Watase]
 48:  630| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 49:  635| [45] [Watase didn't think Ukita's reason was pathetic at all.]
 50:  640| [45] [He could easily understand the desire to save those in jeopardy when their human rights were crushed.]
 51:  645| [47] [Watase]
 52:  646| [45] [(If Wataru were here, she'd probably feel the same way...)]
 53:  651| [45] [Watase held his hand out to Ukita.]
 54:  678| [47] [Watase]
 55:  681| [45] ["I'll trust you. I'll help you out as much as I'm needed to."]
 56:  689| [47] [Ukita]
 57:  692| [45] ["... I am grateful beyond words to hear that."]
 58:  697| [45] [Ukita then gave Watase a firm handshake.]
 59:  702| [45] [His hand was as thin as a dead tree, but his palm was filled with heat.]
 60:  752| [45] [--From that day onwards, Watase and Ukita began making preparations to put their terrorist plot into action.]
 61:  879| [45] [They held their secret meetings to formulate said plot in Watase's apartment.]
 62:  884| [45] [Before the meeting, Watase followed Ukita's instructions and checked the apartment to make sure it wasn't bugged anywhere.]
 63:  889| [45] [He was horrified to discover that there were indeed several bugs in his apartment, but he destroyed all of them.]
 64:  894| [45] [He was a bit cautious after that, but no new bugs were planted.]
 65:  899| [45] [It appeared he had probably long since ceased to be an observation target for Rokumei City.]
 66:  935| [47] [Watase]
 67:  938| [45] ["--Okay then, I need to know everything, Mr. Ukita."]
 68:  946| [47] [Watase]
 69:  949| [45] ["Tell me all the details about the plan and its goal."]
 70:  975| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  978| [45] ["Very well. This is what we've thought up so far."]
 72:  983| [45] [Ukita nodded and began talking.]
 73: 1009| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1012| [45] ["The objects of our hate are 'Rokumei City' and 'LABO'."]
 75: 1020| [47] [Ukita]
 76: 1023| [45] ["We want to deal a fatal blow to the both of them simultaneously."]
 77: 1031| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1034| [45] ["Our first goal towards achieving that is rescuing the captive test subjects."]
 79: 1042| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1045| [45] ["What? How's that related to dealing a blow to LABO?"]
 81: 1053| [47] [Ukita]
 82: 1056| [45] ["They'll act as living witnesses to expose the truth."]
 83: 1082| [47] [Ukita]
 84: 1085| [45] ["No matter how loud we shout, our voices will be smothered or we'll be dismissed as nutjobs--"]
 85: 1111| [47] [Ukita]
 86: 1114| [45] ["But if we rescue the test subjects, then we'll have the best witnesses we could possibly hope for on LABO's wrongdoings."]
 87: 1122| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1125| [45] ["You know how society and the media are-- They won't be able to ignore a story like that from such a direct source of information."]
 89: 1133| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1136| [45] ["I see, that makes sense. That would result in an investigation into all the other things Rokumei City's been covering up all this time one after another."]
 91: 1144| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1147| [45] ["But even so, how are we supposed to break into LABO to do that?"]
 93: 1155| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1158| [45] ["LABO has strict security on par with that of a nuclear power plant, right?"]
 95: 1184| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1187| [45] ["Indeed. That's where you and your rescue squad come in."]
 97: 1195| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1198| [45] ["What?"]
 99: 1224| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1227| [45] ["LABO's security has but one hole in it."]
101: 1253| [47] [Ukita]
102: 1256| [45] ["It's the automatic 'disaster prevention system'-- their biggest blind spot."]
103: 1264| [47] [Watase]
104: 1267| [45] ["So you're planning to exploit the disaster prevention system...?"]
105: 1275| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1278| [45] ["Yes. When a fire breaks out in LABO, they automatically send a report to you guys at 'Sirius', right?"]
107: 1304| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1307| [45] ["That should allow you guys to break into LABO without being stopped by security."]
109: 1315| [47] [Watase]
110: 1318| [45] ["...!"]
111: 1326| [47] [Watase]
112: 1329| [45] ["I get it... so you're saying we should take advantage of the chaos following the fire to get those test subjects out!"]
113: 1334| [45] [Now he finally understood why Ukita had recruited him.]
114: 1360| [47] [Ukita]
115: 1363| [45] ["But this is just your way in."]
116: 1389| [47] [Ukita]
117: 1392| [45] ["LABO's security system has layer upon layer of protection that will provide several obstacles towards the plan's execution."]
118: 1418| [47] [Ukita]
119: 1421| [45] ["I'll explain them one by one."]
120: 1426| [45] [Ukita took out his PDA.]
121: 1477| [45] [A map was on its screen.]
122: 1485| [47] [Ukita]
123: 1488| [45] ["This is a map of LABO. Q's comrades were able to steal this map from the contractors who built the facility."]
124: 1496| [47] [Ukita]
125: 1499| [45] ["Anyway, take a look at this. The test subjects are being held captive in the deepest depths beneath LABO."]
126: 1507| [47] [Watase]
127: 1510| [45] ["You mean in floor B2?"]
128: 1515| [45] [He'd heard that LABO had two surface floors and two basement floors.]
129: 1520| [45] [So he assumed that they'd be on the lowest floor--]
130: 1528| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1531| [45] ["No. Deeper than that."]
132: 1578| [47] [Ukita]
133: 1581| [45] ["In the center of the basement floors is 'Area N'... but the truth is, there's an elevator there that goes down."]
134: 1589| [47] [Watase]
135: 1592| [45] ["What!? So there's a B3!?"]
136: 1640| [47] [Ukita]
137: 1643| [45] ["Precisely. It's a large basement floor located deep underground known as 'Area Zero'--"]
138: 1651| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1654| [45] ["That's where the two test subjects are being held. A place where no sunlight ever reaches."]
140: 1662| [47] [Watase]
141: 1665| [45] ["So we've got two test subjects, huh... Do we know their names, ages, and genders?"]
142: 1673| [47] [Ukita]
143: 1676| [45] ["No. All I was able to discover is that they're called 'Subject N' and "Subject Y-II'."]
144: 1684| [47] [Watase]
145: 1687| [45] ["Y-II? So there's a Y-I?"]
146: 1723| [47] [Ukita]
147: 1726| [45] ["No... they say 'Subject Y' was 'discarded' several years ago."]
148: 1734| [47] [Ukita]
149: 1737| [45] ["They most likely died in LABO, just like 'Subject A'."]
150: 1745| [47] [Watase]
151: 1748| [45] ["... I see."]
152: 1753| [45] [Just then, Ukita's voice interrupted his thoughts.]
153: 1761| [47] [Ukita]
154: 1764| [45] ["... Let's get back on topic. So the test subjects we need to save are in Area Zero--"]
155: 1811| [47] [Ukita]
156: 1814| [45] ["However, in order to get down there, you'll need two security cards from top brass researchers."]
157: 1861| [47] [Ukita]
158: 1864| [45] ["What's more, there's apparently a retinal scan ID process involved."]
159: 1872| [47] [Watase]
160: 1875| [45] ["They sure didn't pull their punches when it came to security on the thing..."]
161: 1922| [47] [Ukita]
162: 1925| [45] ["Indeed. To make matters worse, even if you can get the test subjects out of Area Zero, there's another problem. As soon as you get out of Area N..."]
163: 2021| [47] [Ukita]
164: 2024| [45] ["A 'Case N'-- the code to prevent a test subject from escaping-- will be declared."]
165: 2032| [47] [Watase]
166: 2035| [45] ["A Case N?"]
167: 2082| [47] [Ukita]
168: 2085| [45] ["A code that locks down the countless security gates in the facility."]
169: 2093| [47] [Ukita]
170: 2096| [45] ["What's more, it causes indestructible bulkheads to block all routes to the surface, preventing anyone from getting out."]
171: 2104| [47] [Ukita]
172: 2107| [45] ["Furthermore, the security team and staff will realize something's gone horribly wrong when a Case N is announced."]
173: 2115| [47] [Ukita]
174: 2118| [45] ["Any staff still inside the facility will become desperate to find the escaped test subjects... while the security teams outside the facility will form a perimeter around the facility to prevent them from getting away."]
175: 2180| [47] [Watase]
176: 2183| [45] ["That does sound like quite the challenge... Then is there any way to prevent a Case N from being declared?"]
177: 2209| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2212| [45] ["That'd be impossible."]
179: 2220| [47] [Ukita]
180: 2223| [45] ["The Case N declaration system is conducted by the supercomputer 'Brain Cell', which supervises all of LABO."]
181: 2231| [47] [Ukita]
182: 2234| [45] ["It has three control systems that mutually complement each other. It's impossible to knock them all offline at the same time."]
183: 2242| [47] [Watase]
184: 2245| [45] ["... Talk about thorough."]
185: 2271| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2274| [45] ["Yes. Though apparently you can take the test subjects all the way to Area 5 if you go through standard procedures..."]
187: 2282| [47] [Watase]
188: 2285| [45] ["Area 5? Why's that the one place it's okay to take them to?"]
189: 2293| [47] [Ukita]
190: 2296| [45] ["There are rooms in that area where they conduct examinations and experiments on the test subjects."]
191: 2304| [47] [Ukita]
192: 2307| [45] ["Therefore, it's the only place where the test subjects are allowed to be taken to--"]
193: 2333| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2336| [45] ["But even in the case they are taken to Area 5, it appears a Case N is still declared if they ever approach the elevators and emergency staircases."]
195: 2344| [47] [Watase]
196: 2347| [45] ["So what you're saying is that it's impossible to leave the facility with the test subjects even if we manage to get in there...?"]
197: 2373| [47] [Ukita]
198: 2376| [45] ["Yes. But we must do it regardless. We have to make the impossible possible."]
199: 2381| [45] [Watase nodded.]
200: 2386| [45] [There were three major problems with the plan.]
201: 2391| [45] [The first one was finding a way to get past the security card and retinal scan checks to get down to Area Zero.]
202: 2396| [45] [The second one was finding a way to get the test subjects out of there without being discovered by the staff still in the facility.]
203: 2401| [45] [The third and final one was finding a way to escape the facility with the test subjects even after a Case N had been declared.]
204: 2427| [47] [Ukita]
205: 2430| [45] ["Let's cover the first problem first: how to get down to Area Zero..."]
206: 2456| [47] [Ukita]
207: 2459| [45] ["We'll probably have to render some high ranked researchers unconscious on the day we execute our plan, then take them with us and force them to do the retinal scan."]
208: 2485| [47] [Ukita]
209: 2488| [45] ["That's also how we'll get the cards. That way, we can get down to Area Zero by making it look like we're going through standard procedures."]
210: 2496| [47] [Watase]
211: 2499| [45] ["I don't like the idea of doing that... but we have no choice, huh."]
212: 2504| [45] [Watase accepted Ukita's proposal.]
213: 2530| [47] [Ukita]
214: 2533| [45] ["Let's move on to the next issue then. As for how we can deal with the staff in the facility--"]
215: 2541| [47] [Ukita]
216: 2544| [45] ["We've decided to use the Case N declaration against them."]
217: 2552| [47] [Watase]
218: 2555| [45] ["...? What do you mean?"]
219: 2581| [47] [Ukita]
220: 2584| [45] ["It's a little complicated, but hear me out. It'll go something like this:"]
221: 2589| [45] [And with that lead in, Ukita began explaining.]
222: 2615| [47] [Ukita]
223: 2618| [45] ["First things first, LABO has this machine in it called a WX particle amplifier. It will go haywire if handled incorrectly."]
224: 2626| [47] [Ukita]
225: 2629| [45] ["'Brain Cell' will automatically take action to stop the machine once it goes haywire--"]
226: 2655| [47] [Ukita]
227: 2658| [45] ["But it will take time for it to stop it. If we intentionally cause it to go haywire, that process will take 12 hours."]
228: 2666| [47] [Ukita]
229: 2669| [45] ["And if a Case N is declared at the same time the WX particle amplifier is going haywire..."]
230: 2677| [47] [Ukita]
231: 2680| [45] ["... then it will be impossible to call off the Case N until the machine has stopped going haywire.%NIt will be absolutely impossible for them to open up the sealed bulkheads."]
232: 2688| [47] [Watase]
233: 2691| [45] ["What? Why won't they be able to open up the bulkheads?"]
234: 2717| [47] [Ukita]
235: 2720| [45] ["The WX amplifier is basically a machine that spreads elementary particles that amplify the effects of BC."]
236: 2746| [47] [Ukita]
237: 2749| [45] ["Can you imagine what would happen if a test subject escaped while that machine was going haywire?"]
238: 2775| [47] [Ukita]
239: 2778| [45] ["It's likely they'd use BC to seek help from people outside. In the worst case scenario, the townspeople could end up receiving the test subject's telepathy."]
240: 2786| [47] [Watase]
241: 2789| [45] ["I see... now I understand why they won't be able to open the bulkheads. It's just yet another part of their whole cover-up."]
242: 2797| [47] [Watase]
243: 2800| [45] ["But what does that have to do with how security teams will try to deal with it?"]
244: 2826| [47] [Ukita]
245: 2829| [45] ["Right. I was about to use that as the basis to explain what we should do."]
246: 2837| [47] [Ukita]
247: 2840| [45] ["First, we'll start a fire in the facility and force the staff and security teams to evacuate. We won't rescue the test subjects just yet at that point."]
248: 2848| [47] [Ukita]
249: 2851| [45] ["But if the WX particle amplifier goes haywire and a Case N is declared after they've all evacuated--"]
250: 2877| [47] [Ukita]
251: 2880| [45] ["Then there'll be no one left in the facility."]
252: 2888| [47] [Watase]
253: 2891| [45] ["Everything sounded like a good idea up until that point. But won't that mean we won't be able to get outside?"]
254: 2917| [47] [Ukita]
255: 2920| [45] ["Incorrect. There is still a single place we can escape from even with the bulkheads locked down."]
256: 2928| [47] [Watase]
257: 2931| [45] ["What!? Where's that!?"]
258: 2957| [47] [Ukita]
259: 2960| [45] ["The WX particle amplifier's coolant pipes."]
260: 2971| [45] [Ukita fiddled around with his PDA again after he said that.]
261: 3018| [45] [When he did, the screen changed to show the WX particle amplifier's manual.]
262: 3090| [47] [Ukita]
263: 3093| [45] ["The water used for the WX particle amplifier's coolant is drawn in from Lake Rokumei."]
264: 3101| [47] [Ukita]
265: 3104| [45] ["The coolant's intake and drainage pipes are 1 m in diameter. Just big enough for a person to fit in."]
266: 3112| [47] [Ukita]
267: 3115| [45] ["The pipes are filled with hot water that circulates at high speeds--"]
268: 3132| [47] [Ukita]
269: 3135| [45] ["But the whole thing's set up so that the water automatically stops flowing if you destroy the coolant's 'filtering mechanism'."]
270: 3143| [47] [Watase]
271: 3146| [45] ["Wait, hold on. Won't opening a hole in the intake pipe flood all of LABO?"]
272: 3151| [45] [Watase pointed to a part of the diagram and spoke.]
273: 3168| [47] [Watase]
274: 3171| [45] ["According to this diagram, the 'intake pipe' is located under Lake Rokumei's water level."]
275: 3179| [47] [Watase]
276: 3182| [45] ["Meaning water will pour out of the pipe all at once if you open a hole in it, running water or not... and LABO will be flooded."]
277: 3199| [47] [Ukita]
278: 3202| [45] ["Right, which is why we'll open a hole in the drainage pipe."]
279: 3219| [47] [Ukita]
280: 3222| [45] ["There's a giant pump inside the drainage pipe. That will prevent us from passing through--"]
281: 3249| [47] [Ukita]
282: 3252| [45] ["So I want you to destroy it."]
283: 3257| [45] [Ukita said that with a broad grin on his face.]
284: 3265| [47] [Watase]
285: 3268| [45] ["Did you say... destroy it? How?"]
286: 3294| [47] [Ukita]
287: 3297| [45] ["If you destroy the pump first, then your main obstacle will be the water in the pipe."]
288: 3305| [47] [Ukita]
289: 3308| [45] ["But if we stop the water from running and open up a hole on the bottom half of the pipe--"]
290: 3316| [47] [Watase]
291: 3319| [45] ["... Oh, I get it! Then we can drain the water!"]
292: 3327| [47] [Ukita]
293: 3330| [45] ["Glad you get it."]
294: 3348| [45] [The drainage pipe's exit was above Lake Rokumei's water level.]
295: 3353| [45] [Meaning that unlike the intake pipe, opening a hole in there would cause much less water to pour out.]
296: 3361| [47] [Ukita]
297: 3364| [45] ["So our next issue is how to destroy the pump after we've drained the water, but--"]
298: 3391| [47] [Ukita]
299: 3394| [45] ["This is where I'd appreciate some ideas from you."]
300: 3402| [47] [Ukita]
301: 3405| [45] ["Can you think of any specialized rescue equipment that can be used to destroy the pump?"]
302: 3413| [47] [Watase]
303: 3416| [45] ["Let's see... special equipment to destroy a pump, huh..."]
304: 3421| [45] [Watase thought the whole thing through, then quickly found an answer.]
305: 3429| [47] [Watase]
306: 3432| [45] ["... I know. A jackhammer should probably do the trick."]
307: 3458| [47] [Ukita]
308: 3461| [45] ["A jackhammer?"]
309: 3469| [47] [Watase]
310: 3472| [45] ["You know, the tool used to smash down bedrock. We use it to rescue those who are trapped behind fallen debris."]
311: 3480| [47] [Watase]
312: 3483| [45] ["So it shouldn't look all that suspicious if we use the fire as a pretext to bring one down to the basement."]
313: 3509| [47] [Ukita]
314: 3512| [45] ["Indeed, that sounds like it would work nicely...! But how much time do you think it'd take for one of those things to destroy the pump?"]
315: 3520| [47] [Watase]
316: 3523| [45] ["Well, if we kept working without a break... I'd say about 3 hours or so."]
317: 3531| [47] [Watase]
318: 3534| [45] ["But you said that the bulkheads will remained closed for about 12 hours if a Case N is declared, right?"]
319: 3542| [47] [Watase]
320: 3545| [45] ["So it might take a little time, but it shouldn't be a problem."]
321: 3571| [47] [Ukita]
322: 3574| [45] ["...!"]
323: 3582| [47] [Watase]
324: 3585| [45] ["After we force the facility into lockdown, we'll take our time destroying the pump... and then we can escape to Lake Rokumei with the test subjects."]
325: 3593| [47] [Watase]
326: 3596| [45] ["Those dumbasses at LABO will just be waiting outside the facility the whole time for the lockdown to be lifted. And when the bulkheads finally open..."]
327: 3604| [47] [Watase]
328: 3607| [45] ["... they'll find nothing more than an empty husk."]
329: 3634| [47] [Ukita]
330: 3637| [45] ["Incredible! It's the perfect plan!"]
331: 3642| [45] [Ukita broke out into a reassured smile.]
332: 3647| [45] [Satisfied, Watase returned Ukita's smile with one of his own.]
333: 3655| [47] [Watase]
334: 3658| [45] ["All right, then let's go with this plan! Things are about to get busy!"]
335: 3684| [47] [Ukita]
336: 3687| [45] ["Yes! There's a lot of things we'll need to prepare in order to execute our plan!"]
337: 3695| [47] [Watase]
338: 3698| [45] ["It's about time we got to thinking about the starting point though: how do we cause the fire in the facility?"]
339: 3706| [47] [Ukita]
340: 3709| [45] ["Leave that to me. I'll contact other Q members and get incendiary bombs and the other necessary equipment from them."]
341: 3717| [47] [Watase]
342: 3720| [45] ["Thanks, you're a lifesaver."]
343: 3725| [45] [And so Watase and Ukita began formulating their plan on a grand scale.]
344: 3778| [45] [--Ukita contacted other Q members and gave them the outline of the plan.]
345: 3783| [45] [Q gave their answer on the spot.]
346: 3788| [45] ["It's a good plan. We approve of it as well. We'll back you up in every way we can".]
347: 3793| [45] [Once they got that answer, Watase and Ukita collaborated with the other Q members located in Rokumei City to move forward with the plan.]
348: 3798| [45] [First, they got their answer on how to cause the fire.]
349: 3803| [45] ["We will prepare 100 incendiary time bombs. Set those up in LABO and make them go off all at the same time."]
350: 3876| [47] [Watase]
351: 3879| [45] ["I'm grateful for that. The problem is how to set the bombs in the first place..."]
352: 3905| [47] [Ukita]
353: 3908| [45] ["That will indeed be difficult. Someone will spot the bombs shortly after they're planted and cause a big fuss."]
354: 3916| [47] [Watase]
355: 3919| [45] ["Then can't we hide the bombs in something to disguise them? That way they won't suspect they're bombs when they see them."]
356: 3927| [47] [Watase]
357: 3930| [45] ["Like, for example... by putting them in fire extinguishers."]
358: 3956| [47] [Ukita]
359: 3959| [45] ["Fire extinguishers?"]
360: 4013| [47] [Watase]
361: 4016| [45] ["Our squad directs LABO's disaster prevention."]
362: 4024| [47] [Watase]
363: 4027| [45] ["We replace their old fire extinguishers with new ones once every two years as part of that program. That's our chance."]
364: 4035| [47] [Watase]
365: 4038| [45] ["If we use that opportunity to switch the fire extinguishers out with ones filled with the bombs--"]
366: 4046| [47] [Ukita]
367: 4049| [45] ["I see! Then we could set bombs up all over LABO in no time!"]
368: 4082| [47] [Ukita]
369: 4085| [45] ["And no one ever looks at what's inside a fire extinguisher, so we won't have to worry about anyone finding them! It's the perfect camouflage!"]
370: 4093| [47] [Watase]
371: 4096| [45] ["All right, then we'll go with that."]
372: 4104| [47] [Watase]
373: 4107| [45] ["We're scheduled to replace the fire extinguishers in September of next year. After that, LABO will be filled with bombs disguised as fire extinguishers."]
374: 4160| [45] [--They also received various orders from Q.]
375: 4165| [45] ["As for us, we would like you to physically destroy LABO. It is a symbol of Rokumei City's wrongdoings."]
376: 4170| [45] ["By destroying it, we can let the world know of our resentment".]
377: 4175| [45] ["We have prepared a powerful time bomb that will blow LABO sky high. Plant it inside the facility".]
378: 4248| [47] [Watase]
379: 4251| [45] ["Mmm, it's easy enough to set up that time bomb... but I'd rather we do it in a way to prevent casualties."]
380: 4277| [47] [Ukita]
381: 4280| [45] ["But destroying LABO has a huge benefit to us."]
382: 4306| [47] [Ukita]
383: 4309| [45] ["If we cause an explosion powerful enough to blow up the entire facility, then won't LABO's staff waiting outside believe that both we and the test subjects died in it?"]
384: 4317| [47] [Watase]
385: 4320| [45] ["I see, so that way, we'll pull the wool right over our pursuers' eyes... but there's one major problem with that."]
386: 4328| [47] [Watase]
387: 4331| [45] ["If I've got this right, in order to get down to Area Zero, we have to knock out two high ranked researchers and take them down with us for authentication, correct?"]
388: 4339| [47] [Watase]
389: 4342| [45] ["But that means they'll be stuck in the facility after the Case N is declared. Then they'll get caught up in the explosion."]
390: 4368| [47] [Ukita]
391: 4371| [45] ["That's true..."]
392: 4379| [47] [Watase]
393: 4382| [45] ["On the other hand, I think it's far too risky to take them with us when we escape, so I'd rather not. It's a rather tight escape plan."]
394: 4408| [47] [Ukita]
395: 4411| [45] ["... All right, then how about this?"]
396: 4437| [47] [Ukita]
397: 4440| [45] ["We'll set the time bomb so that it goes off one minute after the lockdown lifts."]
398: 4448| [47] [Ukita]
399: 4451| [45] ["That should give both of them just enough time to escape."]
400: 4459| [47] [Watase]
401: 4462| [45] ["Is there a way we can figure out the time the lockdown will be lifted in advance?"]
402: 4488| [47] [Ukita]
403: 4491| [45] ["Brain Cell's monitor will show the expected time for when the lockdown is to be lifted."]
404: 4499| [47] [Ukita]
405: 4502| [45] ["We'll check that, then set the bomb's timer for one minute after that."]
406: 4528| [47] [Ukita]
407: 4531| [45] ["... Though to be honest, it's a rather desperate measure."]
408: 4539| [47] [Watase]
409: 4542| [45] ["Can't do anything about that. I mean, we're trying to carry out a terrorist plot without killing anyone. It sounds nigh-impossible."]
410: 4568| [47] [Ukita]
411: 4571| [45] ["But aren't we being naive... for coming up with that idea?"]
412: 4579| [47] [Watase]
413: 4582| [45] ["No, it's the right thing to do. We'll be lower than shit if we kill anyone-- no better than the guys at LABO."]
414: 4608| [47] [Ukita]
415: 4611| [45] ["... Yes, you're right!"]
416: 4673| [45] [--And thus their plan approached its final stages.]
417: 4678| [45] [It was then that Q sent their third set of orders--]
418: 4683| [45] ["We're uneasy about only two people carrying out the plan. We would prefer it if you could get about two more people for the job".]
419: 4688| [45] ["We would like you to invite Mr. Seiji Dojima and Mr. Kazuki Hiyama, Comrade Kasasagi's coworkers, to become our comrades".]
420: 4693| [45] [Watase understood what they were getting at.]
421: 4698| [45] [But though he was okay with just himself being a part of it, was it really okay for him to get his coworkers wrapped up in this terrorist plot?]
422: 4703| [47] [Watase]
423: 4704| [45] [(... Those guys have the same background as me. Dojima lost his girlfriend in the Great Arson while Hiyama lost his younger brother.)]
424: 4709| [47] [Watase]
425: 4710| [45] [(So if they learn the truth, they too should hate Rokumei City's barbarism enough to want revenge... just like me...!)]
426: 4763| [45] [--So while he was reluctant at first, Watase eventually contacted Dojima and Hiyama.]
427: 4835| [47] [Ukita]
428: 4838| [45] ["... So, how'd your coworkers react to the news?"]
429: 4846| [47] [Watase]
430: 4849| [45] ["The exact same way I did... They shook with anger and agreed to join Q."]
431: 4875| [47] [Ukita]
432: 4878| [45] ["I see... then that means all the necessary pieces are now in place."]
433: 4883| [45] [And thus Watase and Ukita's plan was now complete.]
434: 4888| [45] [They'd plant incendiary bombs in fire extinguishers and artificially start a fire.]
435: 4893| [45] [Next, they'd cause the WX particle amplifier to go haywire, rescue the test subjects, and cause a Case N to be declared.]
436: 4898| [45] [Once the lockdown began, they'd set the time bomb in the facility, then escape through the coolant's drainage pipe.]
437: 4903| [45] [Then once the bomb went off, all traces of Watase and Ukita's crimes-- as well as any way of finding out if the test subjects were dead or alive-- would go up in flames.]
438: 4911| [47] [Watase]
439: 4914| [45] ["... So all that's left is to actually do this, huh."]
440: 4940| [47] [Ukita]
441: 4943| [45] ["Very well."]
442: 4948| [45] [Ukita took out his PDA.]
443: 4974| [47] [Ukita]
444: 4977| [45] ["Q has sent us one last order to this PDA. I'll read it for us."]
445: 4985| [47] [Watase]
446: 4988| [45] ["What's it say?"]
447: 5014| [47] [Ukita]
448: 5017| [45] ["--We are grateful for all your efforts, Comrades Kasasagi and Ukita."]
449: 5025| [47] [Ukita]
450: 5028| [45] ["We will now commence preparing the bombs and weapons necessary to carry out this plan."]
451: 5037| [47] [Ukita]
452: 5040| [45] ["These include 100 incendiary bombs disguised as fire extinguishers, a 3 kg 'tetryl' explosive that will be used to destroy LABO, and three 'NZ-75' pistols for self-defense."]
453: 5048| [47] [Ukita]
454: 5051| [45] ["The tetryl and pistols will be mixed in with the rescue squad's special equipment and delivered on D-day."]
455: 5059| [47] [Ukita]
456: 5062| [45] ["Your target is the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization. Your objectives are to destroy the facility and abduct the two test subjects."]
457: 5070| [47] [Ukita]
458: 5073| [45] ["The plan will be carried out approximately one year from now-- on September 16, 2030."]
459: 5081| [47] [Watase]
460: 5084| [45] ["... The anniversary of the Great Rokumei City Arson, huh."]
461: 5089| [45] [That day probably held unpleasant memories for Q's members, whoever they were.]
462: 5094| [45] [It was clearly no coincidence that they picked that day of all days to commence their plan.]
463: 5102| [47] [Ukita]
464: 5105| [45] ["--Until that day, each comrade is to make further preparations."]
465: 5114| [47] [Ukita]
466: 5117| [45] ["There are countless things you must do in advance, such as hand-to-hand and firearms combat training."]
467: 5125| [47] [Ukita]
468: 5128| [45] ["Naturally, you mustn't tell anyone else about the plan over the course of the next year, to say the least of opening your heart to anyone."]
469: 5136| [47] [Ukita]
470: 5139| [45] ["Rokumei City is full of countless Communicators. If you open your heart to someone, they might read your mind and find out all about the plan."]
471: 5147| [47] [Ukita]
472: 5150| [45] ["All Communicators are not like us-- they're monsters with strange powers. The now deceased Subject A wasn't the exception. She was the standard."]
473: 5158| [47] [Ukita]
474: 5161| [45] ["Think of all Communicators as abominations. Think of Rokumei City as a city full of monsters."]
475: 5169| [47] [Ukita]
476: 5172| [45] ["We must put an end to this abnormal town's history."]
477: 5180| [47] [Ukita]
478: 5183| [45] ["You may find that to be a rather extreme mindset, but unless you take precise caution, our flawless plan will come crashing down."]
479: 5191| [47] [Ukita]
480: 5194| [45] ["Bear all of that in mind as you wait for the day of reckoning."]
481: 5202| [47] [Ukita]
482: 5205| [45] ["The day where the truth shall be brought to light and 118 lost souls shall at last rest in peace--"]
483: 5210| [45] [Once Ukita had finished reading the long piece of text, he shot Watase a pointed gaze.]
484: 5236| [47] [Ukita]
485: 5239| [45] ["... That's a rare view to voice these days, wouldn't you agree?"]
486: 5247| [47] [Watase]
487: 5250| [45] ["Communicators are abominations, huh..."]
488: 5276| [47] [Ukita]
489: 5279| [45] ["Perhaps that's going too far, but it is indeed true that we cannot open our hearts to anyone."]
490: 5305| [47] [Watase]
491: 5308| [45] ["... Yeah, you said it."]
492: 5369| [45] [And so Watase and his comrades began their long year of preparation.]
493: 5374| [45] [All the way until September 2030--]
