  1:    9| [45] [--With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko turned back, and--]
  2:  134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  137| [45] ["Whoa!"]
  4:  142| [45] [Before he had noticed her, Salyu was standing right behind him.]
  5:  147| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled how this had happened before as he spoke.]
  6:  155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  158| [45] ["H-how long have you been there, Salyu?"]
  8:  184| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  187| [45] ["Just got here. I heard a commotion."]
 10:  195| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  198| [45] ["... You heard that?"]
 12:  206| [47] [Salyu]
 13:  209| [45] ["No, I didn't hear the details. But..."]
 14:  214| [45] [Salyu paused for a moment before continuing.]
 15:  240| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  243| [45] ["... It was an extremely worrying situation."]
 17:  251| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  254| [45] ["Huh?"]
 19:  262| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  265| [45] ["Alice gave me a reaction I had never heard before once she analyzed Mashiro's voice."]
 21:  291| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  294| [45] ["The emotions she read from Mashiro included anger, dejection, and sadness."]
 23:  302| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  305| [45] ["I-it can understand that much?"]
 25:  331| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  334| [45] ["Probably. Although I personally cannot judge the accuracy of the analysis."]
 27:  342| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  345| [45] ["You personally can't...?"]
 29:  350| [45] [Salyu said something somewhat incomprehensible.]
 30:  376| [47] [Salyu]
 31:  379| [45] ["But at the very least, that is what Alice's analysis stated."]
 32:  387| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  390| [45] ["That was the first time Mashiro's voice contained such complex emotion."]
 34:  398| [47] [Salyu]
 35:  401| [45] ["Did something happen?"]
 36:  409| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  412| [45] ["No..."]
 38:  417| [45] [Natsuhiko was at a loss for an explanation.]
 39:  422| [45] [After all, not even he quite understood what Mashiro was feeling.]
 40:  430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  433| [45] ["... It's nothing. Ah, well, we just kinda..."]
 42:  459| [47] [Salyu]
 43:  462| [45] ["Kinda...?"]
 44:  470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  473| [45] ["... We kinda had a little fight."]
 46:  499| [47] [Salyu]
 47:  502| [45] ["A fight? Why?"]
 48:  510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  513| [45] ["Beats me. But, if you could avoid it, I'd like to ask you not to pry into it too much."]
 50:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  524| [45] ["It's not good to poke your nose into others' fights."]
 52:  550| [47] [Salyu]
 53:  553| [45] ["Is that how it works?"]
 54:  561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  564| [45] ["That's how it works."]
 56:  590| [47] [Salyu]
 57:  593| [45] ["... I see."]
 58:  598| [45] [Alice then let out a frail voice.]
 59:  603| [47] [Alice]
 60:  606| [45] ["Kyuu..."]
 61:  632| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  635| [45] ["..."]
 63:  640| [45] [Salyu's expression stiffened.]
 64:  645| [45] [She stared hard at Natsuhiko.]
 65:  650| [47] [Salyu]
 66:  651| [45] ["..."]
 67:  659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  662| [45] ["... What?"]
 69:  688| [47] [Salyu]
 70:  691| [45] ["Well... According to Alice's analysis, you're perplexed?"]
 71:  699| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  702| [45] ["Huh? W-well, yeah, I guess."]
 73:  728| [47] [Salyu]
 74:  731| [45] ["Because of Mashiro? Or because of me?"]
 75:  739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  742| [45] ["Huh... well, both of you, I guess."]
 77:  768| [47] [Salyu]
 78:  771| [45] ["..."]
 79:  776| [45] [Salyu glared at Natsuhiko discontentedly.]
 80:  781| [45] [But still she didn't head back inside.]
 81:  786| [45] [An awkward silence wound between them.]
 82:  791| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83:  792| [45] [(Wh-what...? What's Salyu trying to do here?)]
 84:  797| [45] [He wanted her to just leave him alone, but he dared not say it.]
 85:  802| [45] [He'd feel a little awkward to rub Salyu the wrong way right after having a fight with Mashiro.]
 86:  807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87:  808| [45] [(... Is there anything we can talk about...?)]
 88:  813| [45] [And then he suddenly remembered. A similar situation happened before.]
 89:  818| [45] [So in order to distract them from the awkward situation, Natsuhiko tried to ask about that certain topic.]
 90:  826| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91:  829| [45] ["Um... Salyu?"]
 92:  855| [47] [Salyu]
 93:  858| [45] ["What?"]
 94:  866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95:  869| [45] ["Now that I think about it, the day before yesterday, we had an odd conversation like this in front of the entrance too, didn't we?"]
 96:  895| [47] [Salyu]
 97:  898| [45] ["An odd conversation...?"]
 98:  906| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99:  909| [45] ["You asked me things like if I liked the stars, or what the meaning behind my name was."]
100:  935| [47] [Salyu]
101:  938| [45] ["Mm, I did indeed."]
102:  946| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103:  949| [45] ["What kind of questions were those?"]
104:  954| [45] [Salyu answered with a look on her face that said it should've been obvious.]
105:  980| [47] [Salyu]
106:  983| [45] ["I was trying to introduce myself."]
107:  991| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108:  994| [45] ["Huh? Introduce yourself?"]
109: 1002| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1005| [45] ["That... was a self-introduction?"]
111: 1031| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1034| [45] ["Yes. I had just moved in, so I was trying to convey what sort of temperament I had."]
113: 1042| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1045| [45] ["W-was that it? But it didn't seem like a self-introduction at all to me..."]
115: 1071| [47] [Salyu]
116: 1074| [45] ["That's because you completely shut me down."]
117: 1082| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1085| [45] ["Wait, so you mean when you asked if -I- liked stars, you meant...?"]
119: 1111| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1114| [45] ["Yes. I meant that -I- liked stars."]
121: 1140| [47] [Salyu]
122: 1143| [45] ["So I was trying to start a conversation about stars, but when you said you didn't like them or hate them, I lost the motivation to talk."]
123: 1151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1154| [45] ["I-I'm sorry about that..."]
125: 1159| [45] [Natsuhiko ended up apologizing on impulse.]
126: 1164| [45] [And then after regathering his thoughts, he continued.]
127: 1172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1175| [45] ["Then what was that about asking the meaning behind my name?"]
129: 1201| [47] [Salyu]
130: 1204| [45] ["That was-- just because I noticed something."]
131: 1212| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1215| [45] ["You noticed something?"]
133: 1241| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1244| [45] ["All of your names have something in common. Though it just might be a forced interpretation on my part."]
135: 1249| [45] [Salyu pointed at the night sky as she spoke.]
136: 1346| [47] [Salyu]
137: 1349| [45] ["Japan has the legend of Tanabata, the evening of the seventh. Are you familiar with it, Natsuhiko?"]
138: 1357| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1360| [45] ["Hmm? Yeah."]
140: 1368| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 1371| [45] ["It's that thing where Orihime and Hikoboshi are separated by the Heavenly River, the Milky Way, and can only meet that one night each year..."]
142: 1379| [47] [Salyu]
143: 1382| [45] ["Yes. First off, that 'Hikoboshi', or 'Altair'."]
144: 1390| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1393| [45] ["Natsuhiko Tenkawa. Tenkawa means 'heaven river' like the Heavenly River that 'Hiko' boshi, a summer star, lies beside."]
146: 1401| [47] [Salyu]
147: 1404| [45] ["That's probably not a coincidence."]
148: 1412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1415| [45] ["Ah..."]
150: 1420| [45] [Natsuhiko actually hadn't noticed that before.]
151: 1428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 1431| [45] ["Wait, could that be the meaning behind my name then...?"]
153: 1439| [47] [Salyu]
154: 1442| [45] ["Probably."]
155: 1447| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Yuuri mentioned something similar long ago in the past.]
156: 1452| [45] [Back then, Yuuri had said:]
157: 1457| [45] ["Hikoboshi is your star, isn't it, Natsuhiko? Your names do sound the same."]
158: 1465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 1468| [45] ["I see... but how does that match everyone else?"]
160: 1476| [47] [Salyu]
161: 1479| [45] ["Mm, next is 'Orihime'."]
162: 1487| [47] [Salyu]
163: 1490| [45] ["In western astrology, Orihime is called 'Vega', part of the constellation Lyra."]
164: 1498| [47] [Salyu]
165: 1501| [45] ["Lyra is a harp, much like a koto. Koto. Kotono. So it's Yuuri's star."]
166: 1509| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 1512| [45] ["I see, so that's where you're going."]
168: 1517| [45] [As Salyu had admitted before, it was a little forced, but it certainly did seem to match.]
169: 1525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 1528| [45] ["Then what about Mashiro? Does Mashiro fit in somewhere?"]
171: 1536| [47] [Salyu]
172: 1539| [45] ["On the night of Tanabata, it's said that a flock of birds form a bridge over the Heavenly River with their wings."]
173: 1547| [47] [Salyu]
174: 1550| [45] ["Toba means 'bird wing', so Mashiro 'Toba' completes the set."]
175: 1558| [47] [Salyu]
176: 1561| [45] ["So basically, all of your names relate to the legend of Tanabata."]
177: 1569| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 1572| [45] ["Whoa~! I never even noticed."]
179: 1577| [45] [That was something that neither Natsuhiko, Yuuri, nor Mashiro had ever noticed before.]
180: 1582| [45] [And it was something that Natsuhiko had never expected that Salyu, having been born in France, would point out.]
181: 1658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 1661| [45] ["Salyu, you really know your stars, don't you?"]
183: 1666| [45] [Salyu ever so slightly puffed out her chest in pride and replied.]
184: 1692| [47] [Salyu]
185: 1695| [45] ["I know lots of things, but I've always liked stars in particular."]
186: 1703| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 1706| [45] ["Oh, and what about you, Salyu? I do remember you mentioning the word 'Sairuiu' or 'tear rain' before, though..."]
188: 1732| [47] [Salyu]
189: 1735| [45] ["Mm, that part might be the most forced, but--"]
190: 1761| [47] [Salyu]
191: 1764| [45] ["If it rains on Tanabata, it's called 'Sairuiu', which is said to be the tears shed by Orihime and Hikoboshi."]
192: 1772| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 1775| [45] ["Hahah, then I guess all four of us have Tanabata names then, huh?"]
194: 1801| [47] [Salyu]
195: 1804| [45] ["Yes."]
196: 1809| [45] [Salyu suddenly sank into silence.]
197: 1814| [45] [She then steeled herself and spoke up.]
198: 1840| [47] [Salyu]
199: 1843| [45] ["--Um, Natsuhiko."]
200: 1851| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 1854| [45] ["Hmm?"]
202: 1880| [47] [Salyu]
203: 1883| [45] ["Was what I said interesting?"]
204: 1891| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 1894| [45] ["Huh? What's this all of a sudden?"]
206: 1920| [47] [Salyu]
207: 1923| [45] ["I just want to make sure."]
208: 1931| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 1934| [45] ["Y-yeah. It was interesting. Informative, too..."]
210: 1960| [47] [Salyu]
211: 1963| [45] ["I see. Good."]
212: 1968| [45] [Then finally, Salyu smiled ever so slightly.]
213: 1994| [47] [Salyu]
214: 1997| [45] ["... In that case, I have to do my daily routine, so I'll be heading back to my room."]
215: 2005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2008| [45] ["Hmm? Abrupt as ever, huh."]
217: 2034| [47] [Salyu]
218: 2037| [45] ["You told me I shouldn't pry into other peoples' fights, so I won't say anything more than this."]
219: 2063| [47] [Salyu]
220: 2066| [45] ["But you guys are friends who have matching names. I think it's best you get along."]
221: 2074| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 2077| [45] ["Huh?"]
223: 2103| [47] [Salyu]
224: 2106| [45] ["As for me... I'd be happier if you and Mashiro did get along."]
225: 2154| [45] [And with that, Salyu quickly went back inside.]
226: 2159| [45] [Natsuhiko just stood by himself outside, staring at the door in astonishment.]
227: 2164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 2165| [45] [(Wh... what just happened...?)]
229: 2170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
230: 2171| [45] [(No way... no way...!)]
231: 2176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 2177| [45] [(Did Salyu just console me!?)]
233: 2182| [45] [It was hard to believe it since it happened out of nowhere, but he couldn't think of any other possibility.]
234: 2190| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2193| [45] ["... Is Salyu..."]
236: 2201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 2204| [45] ["Actually a good kid after all?"]
238: 2209| [45] [Natsuhiko whispered with a wry smile.]
239: 2214| [45] [But although Salyu may have said all that--]
240: 2219| [45] [Natsuhiko still didn't quite understand the reason Mashiro was so mad.]
241: 2224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
242: 2225| [45] [(I know you told me to get along with her... but how?)]
243: 2230| [45] [Natsuhiko mulled over that thought as he went back inside.]
