  1:  116| [45] [Those words spurred him on.]
  2:  121| [47] [Man]
  3:  122| [45] [(I'll save her!)]
  4:  127| [45] [The man ran into the blazing room, his heart filled with determination.]
  5:  267| [47] [Man]
  6:  270| [45] ["Ghh!"]
  7:  275| [45] [But he was halted the moment he made it inside.]
  8:  280| [45] [Searing waves of heat barred his path.]
  9:  329| [45] [The girl was only a short ways away, but crossing even that distance would be difficult.]
 10:  334| [45] [At that moment, he heard a voice right next to him.]
 11:  421| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 12:  424| [45] ["What the heck are you doing, Captain!?"]
 13:  429| [45] [The woman who'd tried to warn him had followed him into the room without him even noticing.]
 14:  437| [47] [Man]
 15:  440| [45] ["Uh, w-well, I, umm..."]
 16:  445| [45] [But before he could finish his sentence--]
 17:  468| [47] [Man]
 18:  471| [45] ["Agh, hot!"]
 19:  476| [45] [He felt an intense heat on his head.]
 20:  481| [45] [And a second later, a horrible stench filled his nose.]
 21:  486| [47] [Man]
 22:  487| [45] [(My hair's on fire!?)]
 23:  492| [45] [That caused the man to fly into a panic.]
 24:  515| [47] [Man]
 25:  518| [45] ["Uwaah! Aaaah! Shit! Shit!"]
 26:  523| [45] [The man frantically swatted at his head in an attempt to put out the fire.]
 27:  549| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 28:  552| [45] ["Captain, why're you acting like a total greenhorn...!?"]
 29:  578| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 30:  581| [45] ["Lieutenant, something's wrong with the captain!"]
 31:  589| [47] [Lieutenant]
 32:  592| [45] ["I'm about to provide backup with the hose--!"]
 33:  625| [45] [The woman's voice echoing from outside the room was soon replaced with the roar of the hose.]
 34:  651| [45] [Its water filled the room like mist.]
 35:  656| [45] [But the fire engulfing the man's head didn't go out, driving him to desperation.]
 36:  668| [47] [Man]
 37:  671| [45] ["Goddammit! Go away, go away!"]
 38:  680| [45] [All thoughts of saving the girl had vanished from his mind.]
 39:  689| [45] [With no idea of what to do, he tried to put out the fire by directly bathing himself in the hose's water.]
 40:  698| [45] [But the moment he walked into the jetstream's path--]
 41:  752| [47] [Man]
 42:  755| [45] ["Gah!"]
 43:  760| [45] [Its sheer force knocked him backwards.]
 44:  808| [47] [Man]
 45:  811| [45] ["!!!"]
 46:  816| [45] [The man fell face up, the back of his head slamming onto the floor.]
 47:  824| [47] [Man]
 48:  827| [45] ["Ghh..."]
 49:  883| [45] [His vision swiftly grew dark.]
 50:  900| [47] [Lieutenant]
 51:  903| [45] ["Aah! Captain!"]
 52:  917| [45] [He heard someone's voice from far away.]
 53:  934| [47] [Lieutenant]
 54:  937| [45] ["Captain, why did...!?"]
 55:  951| [45] [That voice too quickly faded away.]
 56:  965| [47] [Man]
 57:  966| [45] [(Wh-what the hell is this... is -this- how it ends?)]
 58:  980| [47] [Man]
 59:  981| [45] [(How... pathe...--)]
 60:  998| [45] [--And with that, he thought no more.]
