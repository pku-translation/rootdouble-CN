  1:  333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:  334| [45] ["..."]
  3:  372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  375| [45] ["... Mmm..."]
  5:  413| [45] [When Natsuhiko woke up that day, he found himself on his own bed.]
  6:  418| [45] [Which was only to be expected. He had always slept and woken up in this room for as long as he could remember.]
  7:  423| [45] [He got up, put on his glasses he had set aside, and stretched his arms out wide.]
  8:  437| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  440| [45] ["Hwaaahh~aah..."]
 10:  445| [45] [He felt as though he had awoken from a worrying dream-- but he couldn't remember what it was.]
 11:  657| [45] [A cursory look at his watch showed that it was "9/10" at "6:19".]
 12:  662| [45] [His watch was perfectly measuring the flow of time today, as usual. Not even once had it broken these past ten years.]
 13:  713| [45] [He climbed out of bed, changed into his uniform, and left his room.]
 14: 1001| [45] [Once he entered the living room, he heard some light humming coming from the kitchen.]
 15: 1016| [47] [???]
 16: 1019| [45] ["Hmhmhmhmm~mm..."]
 17: 1028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18: 1031| [45] ["Good morning."]
 19: 1036| [45] [Once he called out to her,]
 20: 1044| [47] [???]
 21: 1047| [45] ["Ah, good morning!"]
 22: 1052| [45] [the one humming cheerfully replied.]
 23: 1057| [45] [The newscaster on TV was rambling on in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.]
 24: 1069| [47] [Newscaster]
 25: 1072| [45] ["--Next on the news."]
 26: 1077| [47] [Newscaster]
 27: 1080| [45] ["Early this morning, Rokumei City's 'BC Training Center' received objectionable literature from an extremist group."]
 28: 1085| [47] [Newscaster]
 29: 1088| [45] ["A connection to the recently held BC seminar was also identified. The police are now working with the city security department to--"]
 30: 1100| [45] [Natsuhiko casually let the news in one ear and out the other, thinking to himself.]
 31: 1105| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32: 1106| [45] [(Almost time for her to wake up, huh...)]
 33: 1118| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed his mind, he heard the living room door open.]
 34: 1198| [47] [Yuuri]
 35: 1201| [45] ["Mnyu mnyu~..."]
 36: 1249| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37: 1252| [45] ["Good morning, Yuuri."]
 38: 1266| [47] [Yuuri]
 39: 1269| [45] ["Mnyu... Hikorin, Mashiron, good... morning..."]
 40: 1295| [45] [Yuuri sank onto the table as she muttered the nicknames she had for those two.]
 41: 1300| [45] [And right around that time, the other girl came out of the kitchen.]
 42: 1361| [47] [Mashiro]
 43: 1364| [45] ["Good morning, Yuuri! Breakfast is just about done~"]
 44: 1369| [45] [Brightly sounding the morning meal call was "Mashiro"-- Natsuhiko's childhood friend.]
 45: 1374| [45] [Yuuri was about to fall back to sleep before Mashiro's voice woke her up.]
 46: 1382| [47] [Yuuri]
 47: 1385| [45] ["... Nu--? Yay, food time, food time~"]
 48: 1393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49: 1396| [45] ["What's on the menu today?"]
 50: 1444| [47] [Mashiro]
 51: 1447| [45] ["Hash browns, bacon and eggs, salad, omelettes, and orange juice."]
 52: 1455| [47] [Mashiro]
 53: 1458| [45] ["A classic all-American breakfast."]
 54: 1466| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1469| [45] ["Wow, starting the day off with a full meal, huh."]
 56: 1477| [47] [Yuuri]
 57: 1480| [45] ["Looks delicious~"]
 58: 1629| [47] [Mashiro]
 59: 1632| [45] ["Now, then, boys and girls. Put your hands together--"]
 60: 1674| [47] [All 3]
 61: 1677| [45] ["Thanks for the food~"]
 62: 1682| [45] [And thus, they began their breakfast as usual.]
 63: 1714| [47] [Yuuri]
 64: 1717| [45] ["Yup~ it's delicious~ Just like you'd expect from Mashiron~"]
 65: 1725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1728| [45] ["Yeah, it's amazing how you can make all of this in such a short amount of time."]
 67: 1754| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 1757| [45] ["Hahah, I'm just used to it. I mean, I -have- been doing this for over half a year now."]
 69: 1762| [45] [Mashiro gave an embarrassed grin upon being complimented.]
 70: 1767| [45] [Just another typical breakfast at the Tenkawa residence.]
 71: 1772| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1773| [45] [(Now that I think about it, it's a little strange, huh... We're not even family.)]
 73: 1778| [45] [Though they were all sharing a meal at the same table, none of the people here were related.]
 74: 1891| [45] [--The only family Natsuhiko had was his mother.]
 75: 1896| [45] [His father passed away before Natsuhiko could remember.]
 76: 1901| [45] [His mother worked hard to support them, to the point she became a serious workaholic.]
 77: 1906| [45] [She spent most of her time at work, seldom returning home.]
 78: 1982| [45] [As Natsuhiko sat lost in thought, a concerned voice called out to him.]
 79: 1990| [47] [Yuuri]
 80: 1993| [45] ["Huh? Hikorin, you've barely touched your food. Does your tummy hurt?"]
 81: 2001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 2004| [45] ["Ah, no, I'm fine. I just wanted to savor the food as I ate."]
 83: 2046| [47] [Yuuri]
 84: 2049| [45] ["Really? That's good."]
 85: 2255| [45] [--This girl's name was "Yuuri Kotono".]
 86: 2259| [45] [She was Natsuhiko's childhood friend, and two years his senior.]
 87: 2264| [45] [She started living in this house with Natsuhiko long ago due to extenuating circumstances.]
 88: 2268| [45] [They grew up like siblings and even today they seemed like real family members.]
 89: 2273| [45] [Yuuri was a kind girl and would always worry about Natsuhiko, almost to a fault.]
 90: 2335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 2338| [45] ["... I might not look it, but I've got a sturdy body. I've always got a healthy appetite."]
 92: 2361| [45] [And with that declaration, he stuffed his cheeks with bread, causing a different cheerful voice to chime in this time.]
 93: 2387| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 2390| [45] ["Oh, I like how you eat, Natsuhiko. Makes all that effort worth it."]
 95: 2596| [45] [--This girl's name was "Mashiro Toba".]
 96: 2601| [45] [She didn't exactly live with Natsuhiko.]
 97: 2606| [45] [She was another one of Natsuhiko's childhood friends, but she only started having breakfast here about half a year ago.]
 98: 2610| [45] [In the absence of his mother, Natsuhiko generally did most of the chores in the Tenkawa residence.]
 99: 2614| [45] [But skillful and adaptable as he was, even Natsuhiko had something he wasn't good at, and that something was cooking.]
100: 2618| [45] [Prior to Natsuhiko entering high school, a commuting housekeeper had prepared his meals, but this spring, she had to resign for personal reasons.]
101: 2622| [45] [And that's when Natsuhiko's mother asked Mashiro to help prepare breakfast and dinner since they lived in the same neighborhood.]
102: 2682| [45] [--Natsuhiko bowed his head to Mashiro's words and muttered softly.]
103: 2690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 2693| [45] ["But still... sorry for making you do this all the time, Mashiro."]
105: 2719| [47] [Mashiro]
106: 2722| [45] ["Whaddaya mean? Your mother pays me after all, so it's kinda like a part-time job."]
107: 2748| [47] [Mashiro]
108: 2751| [45] ["And besides, it's not like I do it for you or anything. If I had to say, I do it more for Yuuri.%NRight, Yuuri?"]
109: 2793| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 2796| [45] ["Hmm, I'm happy to hear that, but..."]
111: 2804| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 2807| [45] ["Ah, I see how it is. Well, I don't care either way as long as I get to eat delicious food."]
113: 2812| [45] [And then, as if to interrupt their peaceful chit-chat, an unsettling voice rang out.]
114: 2817| [47] [Newscaster]
115: 2820| [45] ["Next on the news."]
116: 2825| [47] [Newscaster]
117: 2828| [45] ["Last night, a fire broke out at the 'BC Development Center', a research facility in Rokumei City. Six research buildings burned down."]
118: 2872| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 2875| [45] ["A fire...?"]
120: 2924| [45] [Suddenly, silence spread across the dining table, but the newscaster continued matter-of-factly.]
121: 2929| [47] [Newscaster]
122: 2932| [45] ["At the time of the fire, several staff members and researchers were inside the facility--"]
123: 2937| [47] [Newscaster]
124: 2940| [45] ["But the fire department rescue squad was dispatched and fortunately brought everyone out alive."]
125: 3036| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 3039| [45] ["Everyone was saved. That's great~"]
127: 3047| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 3050| [45] ["Hm? Ah, yeah, I guess."]
129: 3076| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 3079| [45] ["Huh? Now that's an uncaring thing to say. You're so cold, Natsuhiko."]
131: 3087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 3090| [45] ["You think so? Nothing really productive happens if you let things on the other side of the TV screen get to you, does it?"]
133: 3132| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 3135| [45] ["Hmm... but it did happen in this town, so you can't really say we're completely uninvolved..."]
135: 3143| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 3146| [45] ["Things have gotten dangerous around here lately. Like some sort of incident's just waiting to happen..."]
137: 3154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 3157| [45] ["You're overthinking things. I'm sure this town's safe."]
139: 3162| [45] [The town they lived in was quite good about public order.]
140: 3167| [45] [It was unthinkable that any of them would get caught up in an incident.]
141: 3233| [45] [However, at that time--]
142: 3238| [45] [Yuuri shook her head and quietly spoke.]
143: 3264| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 3267| [45] ["... Hikorin, you shouldn't let yourself become too careless."]
145: 3281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 3284| [45] ["Huh?"]
147: 3292| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 3295| [45] ["Dreadful incidents don't just happen on the other side of the TV screen, you know."]
149: 3321| [47] [Yuuri]
150: 3324| [45] ["After all, something completely unexpected could happen to you too, Hikorin..."]
151: 3329| [45] [Natsuhiko's expression stiffened upon hearing such an ominous prediction.]
152: 3334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 3335| [45] [(No way...)]
154: 3340| [45] [He tried to say that, but his voice wouldn't come out.]
155: 3406| [47] [--Dreadful incidents don't happen twice.]
156: 3413| [47] [His peaceful days would continue forever, without even the slightest disturbance.]
157: 3420| [47] [At least that's what he always thought--]
158: 3472| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 3473| [45] [(...??)]
160: 3690| [45] [Yet a disturbance was exactly what Natsuhiko suddenly noticed out of the corner of his eye.]
161: 3695| [45] [His prized watch from years ago--]
162: 3700| [45] [--had broken sometime when he wasn't looking.]
163: 3705| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 3706| [45] [(Why...? When did it...?)]
165: 3772| [47] [--Natsuhiko was still unaware--]
166: 3779| [47] [--of why that watch of his had broken.]
167: 3786| [47] [The watch dial read--]
168: 3801| [47] ["9/16"]
169: 3809| [47] ["6:19"]
170: 3825| [47] [That was the time Natsuhiko's watch broke.]
