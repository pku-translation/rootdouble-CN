  1:   12| [45] [Salyu nodded lightly.]
  2:   38| [47] [Salyu]
  3:   41| [45] ["I was a little, no, quite afraid of leaving the house."]
  4:   67| [47] [Salyu]
  5:   70| [45] ["So at first, I never felt the desire to know the outside world."]
  6:   96| [47] [Salyu]
  7:   99| [45] ["But even so... as I came to this town, I finally came to realize something:"]
  8:  125| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  128| [45] ["Deep down, I really did want to go outside after all."]
 10:  136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  139| [45] ["... I see."]
 12:  144| [45] [Natsuhiko remembered another girl who was waiting at home and could not leave.]
 13:  149| [45] [Salyu spoke in a depressed tone.]
 14:  175| [47] [Salyu]
 15:  178| [45] ["... That said, I'm still afraid."]
 16:  186| [47] [Salyu]
 17:  189| [45] ["Contact with other people is always accompanied by fear. Honestly speaking-- I was afraid of both you and Mashiro."]
 18:  197| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  200| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 20:  226| [47] [Salyu]
 21:  229| [45] ["I'm sorry if you find that discomforting."]
 22:  237| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  240| [45] ["N-no, not at all."]
 24:  248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  251| [45] ["... You did well to speak up about it. I'm actually glad you did."]
 26:  277| [47] [Salyu]
 27:  280| [45] ["It helps a lot to hear that."]
 28:  285| [45] [Salyu sighed slightly. She appeared to be genuinely relieved.]
 29:  290| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly tried to change the topic.]
 30:  298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  301| [45] ["I-if there's anything you want to say to me, feel free to just say it, okay?"]
 32:  327| [47] [Salyu]
 33:  330| [45] ["Okay... actually, I was particularly scared of you."]
 34:  338| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  341| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 36:  367| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  370| [45] ["Back when we first met, you were so cold to me. I thought I had done something bad,%Nbut I didn't understand what and that made me sad."]
 38:  378| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  381| [45] ["Our conversations often didn't mesh, and there were several times where I felt uneasy."]
 40:  389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  392| [45] ["I-I'm... I'm so sorry about that!"]
 42:  418| [47] [Salyu]
 43:  421| [45] ["No, it's okay."]
 44:  447| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  450| [45] ["You gradually grew kinder to me. It made me quite happy."]
 46:  458| [47] [Salyu]
 47:  461| [45] ["And little by little, my fear of you faded away and being with you became a happy thing."]
 48:  487| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  490| [45] ["So I decided to try my best to come in contact with other people, no matter how scary it may seem."]
 50:  498| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  501| [45] ["...!"]
 52:  506| [45] [Natsuhiko looked Salyu in the face long and hard.]
 53:  511| [45] [Her every earnest word touched his heart.]
 54:  519| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  522| [45] ["Salyu, that's so... so admirable of you...!"]
 56:  548| [47] [Salyu]
 57:  551| [45] ["No, I didn't come to that way of thinking by myself. What you told me this afternoon gave me the boost I needed."]
 58:  559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  562| [45] ["Huh?"]
 60:  588| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  591| [45] ["You said 'you don't have to understand what's on other people's minds'. It was really comforting to hear that."]
 62:  599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  602| [45] ["... Yeah. It was a little comforting for me to say it too."]
 64:  628| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  631| [45] ["You're like me?"]
 66:  639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  642| [45] ["Yeah, just like you."]
 68:  647| [45] [She smiled slightly at that statement.]
 69:  673| [47] [Salyu]
 70:  676| [45] ["... So many things really have happened since I came to this city. So many things I could never learn at home."]
 71:  684| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  687| [45] ["It's an honor to be a part of your learning experience."]
 73:  713| [47] [Salyu]
 74:  716| [45] ["Mmm... but there was one slightly sinful influence in this experience."]
 75:  724| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  727| [45] ["A sinful influence?"]
 77:  753| [47] [Salyu]
 78:  756| [45] ["Yes. Spending time with all of you has given me a taste of the forbidden fruit of fun."]
 79:  761| [45] [Salyu cast her head down in shame.]
 80:  766| [45] [A faint shadow cast over her stiff expression.]
 81:  792| [47] [Salyu]
 82:  795| [45] ["... When I was at home, I only spoke the bare minimum with my parents and tutors."]
 83:  821| [47] [Salyu]
 84:  824| [45] ["So never in my life had I experienced either fear or fun."]
 85:  850| [47] [Salyu]
 86:  853| [45] ["But now that I've come to this town, I look back to my past... and find nothing that qualifies as a nostalgic memory."]
 87:  879| [47] [Salyu]
 88:  882| [45] ["I wouldn't say I'd have been better off not knowing... but still, it makes me a little sad nonetheless."]
 89:  887| [45] [Salyu's expression indeed looked sad--]
 90:  892| [45] [And so Natsuhiko spoke up without thinking.]
 91:  900| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  903| [45] ["What are you talking about, Salyu?"]
 93:  929| [47] [Salyu]
 94:  932| [45] ["Huh?"]
 95:  940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96:  943| [45] ["If you don't have any nostalgic memories, then why don't we make up for all that lost time by making heaps of them now?"]
 97:  951| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98:  954| [45] ["I'm sure Mashiro and Yuuri would be glad to... I mean, I know I would."]
 99:  962| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100:  965| [45] ["You've made so many friends, don't you see? So there's nothing you need to worry about."]
101:  991| [47] [Salyu]
102:  994| [45] ["..."]
103:  999| [45] [Salyu looked up and made direct eye contact with Natsuhiko.]
104: 1025| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1028| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, you're kind of an optimist."]
106: 1036| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1039| [45] ["W-what's wrong with that? That's just part of my nature, I guess."]
108: 1065| [47] [Salyu]
109: 1068| [45] ["I think so too, but..."]
110: 1094| [47] [Salyu]
111: 1097| [45] ["That might be why your words often relieve me of my worries."]
112: 1123| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1126| [45] ["I'll say it again. Thank you, Natsuhiko."]
114: 1131| [45] [Salyu smiled sweetly.]
115: 1139| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1142| [45] ["!"]
117: 1147| [45] [Natsuhiko was shocked.]
118: 1152| [45] [It was the first time he had seen Salyu truly smile like that.]
119: 1157| [45] [It was so unexpectedly cute-- or rather, it was -exactly- as cute as he had expected--]
120: 1165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1168| [45] ["Ah, um, well... it was nothing, I guess...!"]
122: 1173| [45] [As Natsuhiko stammered, Alice let out a voice he hadn't heard before.]
123: 1385| [47] [Alice]
124: 1388| [45] ["Kyukyuuu~...!"]
125: 1453| [47] [Salyu]
126: 1456| [45] ["!?"]
127: 1461| [45] [Salyu's face stiffened that very moment.]
128: 1487| [47] [Salyu]
129: 1490| [45] ["Huh...?"]
130: 1495| [45] [She looked as if she could not believe what she had heard from Alice.]
131: 1503| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1506| [45] ["Wh-what's wrong?"]
133: 1532| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1535| [45] ["Mmm... nothing..."]
135: 1540| [45] [Salyu looked at Natsuhiko, her face beet red.]
136: 1566| [47] [Salyu]
137: 1569| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, what were you thinking just now?"]
138: 1577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1580| [45] ["Huh... n-nothing really..."]
140: 1663| [47] [Salyu]
141: 1666| [45] ["... Honest?"]
142: 1674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1677| [45] ["... Honest."]
144: 1700| [47] [Salyu]
145: 1701| [45] ["..."]
146: 1706| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1707| [45] ["..."]
148: 1712| [45] [Silence filled the room.]
149: 1717| [45] [But it wasn't an uncomfortable silence at all--]
150: 1722| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 1723| [45] [(But if the silence keeps going, it's gonna get awkward real quick...!)]
152: 1728| [45] [The flustered Natsuhiko quickly tried to change the subject.]
153: 1736| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 1739| [45] ["A-anyway! You're glad you came to this town, right?"]
155: 1765| [47] [Salyu]
156: 1768| [45] ["Huh? I... I guess."]
157: 1773| [45] [Salyu looked as if she were caught off-guard for a second.]
158: 1778| [45] [But then she took a deep breath and returned to her usual poker face.]
159: 1833| [47] [Salyu]
160: 1836| [45] ["I certainly don't regret coming here."]
161: 1844| [47] [Salyu]
162: 1847| [45] ["Nor do I regret enrolling in Rokumei Academy or living in the Tenkawa household."]
163: 1855| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 1858| [45] ["I see... but about that, why did you start living at our place?"]
