  0:   53| [45] [--Next was the memory--]
  1:  103| [45] [--of when Ukita had told Watase about the things LABO was doing after Communicator A's death.]
  2:  110| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  111| [45] [(If I remember correctly--)]
  4:  116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  117| [45] [(This is when Watase was boiling with hatred and rage, when he heard that LABO was still creating "monsters" like Communicator A.)]
  6:  122| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  123| [45] [(That was what led Watase to becoming a terrorist...)]
  8:  128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  129| [45] [(But was that not it? What was the real trigger for Watase...?)]
 10:  161| [47] [Watase]
 11:  164| [45] ["What happened to Subject A!? Is she still living in LABO!?"]
 12:  172| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  175| [45] ["No, she died."]
 14:  183| [47] [Watase]
 15:  186| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
 16:  194| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  197| [45] ["After causing that incident, A was used by LABO as a human test subject-- and then died there just a year after she'd been confined."]
 18:  205| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  208| [45] ["She probably died a cruel death. In the end, A too was nothing more than a victim of Rokumei City's wrongdoings."]
 20:  231| [47] [Watase]
 21:  234| [45] ["..."]
 22:  239| [45] [A sense of emptiness filled Watase's body.]
 23:  244| [45] [Having immediately lost the target of his hatred-- he switched it over to a new one.]
 24:  299| [47] [Watase]
 25:  302| [45] ["What happened with the Rokumei City government... after that?"]
 26:  310| [47] [Watase]
 27:  313| [45] ["What happened with LABO after they lost their valuable test subject due to A's death?"]
 28:  321| [47] [Ukita]
 29:  324| [45] ["They abducted new test subjects and used them to continue their BC research."]
 30:  332| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  335| [45] ["Out of all the Communicators who live in Rokumei City-- those who possess particularly superb abilities are confined in LABO and made into test subjects."]
 32:  373| [45] [--A floral scent drifted from somewhere at that moment.]
 33:  516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  517| [45] [(This is it! This is the part I have to repair!)]
 35:  522| [45] [And with that thought, Natsuhiko sent deep affection for Communicators to Watase's heart.]
 36:  703| [45] [When he did, the false memory faded--]
 37:  753| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  756| [45] ["And so more monsters like A have been growing in number one by one."]
 39:  794| [47] [Watase]
 40:  797| [45] ["Why would they ever do something like that!?"]
 41:  835| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  838| [45] ["One of their goals is, naturally, to study BC."]
 43:  876| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  879| [45] ["And the other one... is to create a kind of biological weapon."]
 45:  946| [45] [--and the lies were replaced with the truth.]
 46:  970| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  973| [45] ["However, to continue their research... they are victimizing children."]
 48:  978| [45] [Watase felt sympathy well up in his heart when he heard that.]
 49:  983| [47] [Watase]
 50:  984| [45] [(Even if they're Communicators, victimizing kids is just...!)]
 51:  989| [45] [It was absolutely unforgivable.]
 52:  997| [47] [Ukita]
 53: 1000| [45] ["But no one's realized this. So there's no one who can talk about or leak this."]
 54: 1008| [47] [Ukita]
 55: 1011| [45] ["The truth will forever continue to be covered-up and vanish into the deepest darkness."]
 56: 1019| [47] [Watase]
 57: 1022| [45] ["... I see..."]
 58: 1030| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1033| [45] ["So the Rokumei City government... Wataru's killers..."]
 60: 1041| [47] [Watase]
 61: 1044| [45] ["... are doing the same thing they did 15 years ago all over again...!"]
 62: 1049| [45] [Flames of rage burned up within Watase.]
 63: 1054| [45] [Rage for the masterminds who were pulling the strings in the background all this time.]
 64: 1088| [45] [--Once he had finished viewing that memory, Natsuhiko thought for a moment.]
 65: 1093| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1094| [45] [(So Watase's hatred... wasn't directed at Communicators...)]
 67: 1099| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1100| [45] [(But rather the Rokumei City government, the ones who caused everything?)]
 69: 1105| [45] [It appeared that this was Watase's true memory.]
 70: 1110| [45] [Natsuhiko felt a bit of relief, then left the memory...]
 71: 1137| [45] [--The repairs to the memory were all done.]
 72: 1143| [45] [Natsuhiko left the memory with a mental sigh of relief...]
 73: 1173| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1176| [45] ["And so more monsters like A have been growing in number one by one."]
 75: 1184| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1187| [45] ["Why would they ever do something like that!?"]
 77: 1195| [47] [Ukita]
 78: 1198| [45] ["One of their goals is, naturally, to study BC."]
 79: 1206| [47] [Ukita]
 80: 1209| [45] ["And the other one... is to create a kind of biological weapon."]
 81: 1217| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1220| [45] ["Did you say... a biological weapon!?"]
 83: 1228| [47] [Ukita]
 84: 1231| [45] ["The incident with A was merely an accident, but if you look at it from another angle, you'll find that Communicators who have become monsters can be used in interesting ways."]
 85: 1239| [47] [Ukita]
 86: 1242| [45] ["For example, let's say you send one of them into the capital of an enemy nation."]
 87: 1250| [47] [Ukita]
 88: 1253| [45] ["What do you think would happen next?"]
 89: 1261| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1264| [45] ["They'd amplify the malice of the city's residents... leading to mass chaos and destruction...?"]
 91: 1272| [47] [Ukita]
 92: 1275| [45] ["Precisely. They could intentionally cause the same thing that happened in Rokumei City 15 years ago."]
 93: 1283| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1286| [45] ["If left alone for a few days, arson and crimes would spread through the whole city, criminals would run rampant, and public order would likely be impossible to restore."]
 95: 1294| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1297| [45] ["But the attacked party wouldn't even realize that they'd been attacked."]
 97: 1305| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1308| [45] ["For the core concept behind this biological weapon is that it devastates people's minds."]
 99: 1316| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1319| [45] ["A weapon that only damages a country's citizens without actually damaging the country itself. Truly a weapon of the new era."]
101: 1327| [47] [Watase]
102: 1330| [45] ["But isn't Rokumei City just a local government!? What would drive them to do that!?"]
103: 1338| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1341| [45] ["The truth is, the Rokumei City government has this intimate relationship with a certain foreign company."]
105: 1349| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1352| [45] ["On the outside, they're just a pharmaceutical company, but behind the facade, they're an arms dealer. Merchants of death, as the term goes."]
107: 1360| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1363| [45] ["Almost all of the sinister research being carried out is done at their request."]
109: 1371| [47] [Ukita]
110: 1374| [45] ["... But no one's realized this. So there's no one who can talk about or leak this."]
111: 1382| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1385| [45] ["The truth will forever continue to be covered-up and vanish into the deepest darkness."]
113: 1393| [47] [Watase]
114: 1396| [45] ["... I see..."]
115: 1404| [47] [Watase]
116: 1407| [45] ["So Rokumei City..."]
117: 1415| [47] [Watase]
118: 1418| [45] ["... is trying to create more of those monsters responsible for Wataru and our parents' deaths...!"]
119: 1423| [45] [Flames of rage burned up within Watase.]
120: 1428| [45] [His fear of the intense might of the Communicators transformed into hatred.]
121: 1476| [45] [--The memory was no different from the last time--]
122: 1481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1482| [45] [(Did I fail the repair job...?)]
124: 1487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1488| [45] [(Do I have to strengthen his favor for Communicators more?)]
126: 1493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1494| [45] [(I should strengthen his favor for those he thinks of as Communicators as much as possible...)]
128: 1499| [45] [Turning his attention elsewhere, Natsuhiko left the memory for the time being...]
