  0:   65| [45] [--After Watase had chased after Salyu into a contaminated zone--]
  1:   70| [45] [He fainted there and was taken back by Jun.]
  2:   75| [45] [Jun entrusted him to Ena and urgently went to go call Kazami.]
  3:  111| [45] [Ena shuddered as she looked at Watase's unconscious body.]
  4:  116| [47] [Ena]
  5:  117| [45] [(... They're enough to knock out a grown man... I guess WX particles are more dangerous than I had thought.)]
  6:  128| [45] [As Ena thought to herself, Jun and Kazami eventually returned.]
  7:  266| [47] [Jun]
  8:  269| [45] ["Okay, Ms. Tsubakiyama, please take care of the captain for us, all right?"]
  9:  323| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  326| [45] ["I'm so sorry... Rescue workers shouldn't be causing trouble for a bystander like this."]
 11:  331| [47] [Ena]
 12:  334| [45] ["It's unavoidable in this situation. More importantly, I'm counting on you to extinguish the fires."]
 13:  360| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  363| [45] ["Yes. Moribe, let's go."]
 15:  417| [47] [Jun]
 16:  420| [45] ["Roger!"]
 17:  598| [45] [The two rescue workers rushed down the stairs to the raging flames on the floor below.]
 18:  606| [45] [Ena saw them off and left the stairwell, dragging Watase by his shoulder.]
 19:  731| [47] [Ena]
 20:  734| [45] ["... *huff* *huff*..."]
 21:  739| [45] [Ena panted heavily as she carried Watase.]
 22:  744| [45] [Naturally, even Ena had to train her body when she joined the ESP Bureau.]
 23:  749| [45] [But that still didn't change how heavy a large man like Watase was.]
 24:  754| [47] [Ena]
 25:  755| [45] [(He's quite the troublesome one, huh... I took so much time to feign being a normal woman, and now I'm working against all that.)]
 26:  760| [45] [Though she was cursing his name in her heart, it wasn't as if she completely ignored Watase's efforts.]
 27:  765| [45] [When Salyu had run away into a contaminated zone and shook off Jun and Watase, not even Ena herself could follow after the girl.]
 28:  770| [45] [And the reason Ena couldn't was simply because she was afraid of entering the contaminated zone.]
 29:  775| [45] [But Watase dashed into the contaminated zone without hesitation-- even though he was under the impression that it was contaminated with radiation.]
 30:  780| [45] [Even though he had lost all his memories as a rescue worker.]
 31:  785| [45] [Ena would have to say it was an extremely reckless act.]
 32:  790| [47] [Ena]
 33:  791| [45] [(But I guess I don't really hate that kind of thing...)]
 34:  796| [45] [Ena knew two others who were like Watase:]
 35:  801| [45] [Her father, and a dog.]
 36:  806| [47] [Ena]
 37:  807| [45] [(... Now that I think about it, their rescue squad's named "Sirius", isn't it...?)]
 38:  812| [47] [Ena]
 39:  813| [45] [(That name kind of brings me back...)]
 40:  818| [45] [That was the name of a dog Ena had kept in the past.]
 41:  863| [45] [--It had already been nine years ago since that day.]
 42:  868| [45] [After her father's death, Ena had moved out of Rokumei City to a neighboring town, where she one day found a dog.]
 43:  873| [45] [There was a wooden tag around the dog's neck with the following message:]
 44:  878| [45] ["I am a smart dog. My name is Sirius. Please adopt me."]
 45:  883| [45] [--The handwriting was definitely a child's, and there was a telephone number written below.]
 46:  888| [45] [That child was probably the previous owner. When Ena's mother called that number, the boy on the other end seemed really happy.]
 47:  893| [45] [And Sirius was a "smart dog" indeed.]
 48:  898| [45] [Whenever Ena felt down, he would rub his nose against her to console her.]
 49:  903| [45] [He loved small children, so whenever she took him out for a walk in the park, the children would always play with him.]
 50:  908| [45] [He even dived into a river to try and save a drowning child.]
 51:  913| [47] [Ena]
 52:  914| [45] [(... But in the end, Sirius couldn't fix the situation...)]
 53:  919| [47] [Ena]
 54:  920| [45] [(I ended up having to save both the kid and Sirius.)]
 55:  925| [45] [But nevertheless, Ena loved the gentle Sirius for giving it his best.]
 56:  930| [45] [However, he died right before Ena joined the ESP Bureau...]
 57:  983| [47] [Ena]
 58:  984| [45] [(Now that I think about it, carrying Captain Kasasagi like this now is kind of like the situation back then, isn't it...)]
 59:  989| [45] [It was a little amusing when she thought about it like that.]
 60:  994| [45] [For the first time after seeing Kuroda and Higa's dead bodies, Ena finally found a moment of peace.]
 61:  999| [45] [But in spite of that--]
 62: 1031| [47] [Ena]
 63: 1034| [45] ["... Sheesh, Captain Kasasagi, you sure do weigh a ton...!"]
 64: 1039| [47] [Ena]
 65: 1040| [45] [(Sirius the dog wasn't this heavy.)]
 66: 1045| [47] [Ena]
 67: 1046| [45] [(Geez... Get it together, Sirius the human.)]
 68: 1052| [45] [--As soon as that thought crossed Ena's mind, Watase woke up.]
