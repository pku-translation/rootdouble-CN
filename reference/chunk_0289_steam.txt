  1:   62| [45] [Even after Watase had left the shelter-- Natsuhiko glared at the shut door for a while.]
  2:   67| [45] [Yuuri accosted him.]
  3:   93| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:   96| [45] ["Hikorin... why did you talk like that to Captain Kasasagi?"]
  5:  104| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  107| [45] ["I'm sorry... I lost my temper... When I saw how badly injured Mashiro was, I just couldn't forgive Watase for it..."]
  7:  133| [47] [Yuuri]
  8:  136| [45] ["Huh!? So Mashiron's injuries really were because of Captain Kasasagi?"]
  9:  144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  147| [45] ["Yeah, Watase shot her before he lost his memories."]
 11:  170| [45] [Natsuhiko gave Yuuri a summary of the events that led him up to here:]
 12:  222| [45] [After Yuuri erased her phantom, Watase caught up to Mashiro and Natsuhiko and shot them...]
 13:  271| [45] [At the end of that struggle, Natsuhiko passed out in Area N.]
 14:  320| [45] [Afterwards, he saw the six-hour escape drama through Watase's five senses--]
 15:  325| [45] [Once Yuuri had heard the entire story, she spoke painfully.]
 16:  358| [47] [Yuuri]
 17:  361| [45] ["So that's what happened..."]
 18:  369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  372| [45] ["Yeah. So, I know the current 'amnesiac Watase' is almost like a completely different person from the pre-amnesiac Watase, but..."]
 20:  380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  383| [45] ["I really still can't find it in me to forgive him."]
 22:  427| [45] [It tore his heart apart to look at Mashiro's pale face as she lay on the ground.]
 23:  432| [45] [It seemed that Mashiro had used up the last remaining bit of her strength to send that final telepathy.]
 24:  437| [45] [She had probably passed out as soon as she finished communicating with Natsuhiko.]
 25:  445| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  448| [45] ["Please be okay... Please wake up...!"]
 27:  456| [47] [Yuuri]
 28:  459| [45] ["Yes..."]
 29:  464| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri held Mashiro's hands and prayed.]
 30:  471| [45] [--But they couldn't spend all their time praying.]
 31:  476| [45] [Natsuhiko was worried about Mashiro, but there were many things he needed to confirm if he wanted to escape outside with her.]
 32:  484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  487| [45] ["... Hey, Yuuri..."]
 34:  555| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  558| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 36:  566| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  569| [45] ["Mashiro and I know next to nothing about LABO."]
 38:  577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  580| [45] ["We don't know the true meaning behind what happened here today."]
 40:  588| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  591| [45] ["But Yuuri, you've been here in LABO, so do you know anything about what's going on?"]
 42:  641| [45] [When he saw Yuuri's memories, he learned that LABO was a BC research facility.]
 43:  646| [45] [But there were still many mysteries left unsolved.]
 44:  697| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  700| [45] ["What was that thing in Area N-- that 'WX particle amplifier'?"]
 46:  718| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  721| [45] ["If there's no nuclear reactor, then what's spreading through the facility?"]
 48:  729| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  732| [45] ["What's the phenomenon that they've been calling a 'meltdown'?"]
 50:  785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  788| [45] ["What does the Procyon really measure? Exactly what kind of drug is AD actually?"]
 52:  793| [47] [Yuuri]
 53:  794| [45] ["..."]
 54:  802| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  805| [45] ["I've come up with several questions, but..."]
 56:  813| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  816| [45] ["Do you know any of the answers, Yuuri?"]
 58:  881| [45] [Yuuri softly nodded.]
 59:  907| [47] [Yuuri]
 60:  910| [45] ["... Yes, I know everything."]
 61:  918| [47] [Yuuri]
 62:  921| [45] ["I've learned all sorts of things through my nine-year stay at LABO."]
 63:  947| [47] [Yuuri]
 64:  950| [45] ["Including truths that have been withheld from society... and things I would rather not have known."]
 65:  976| [47] [Yuuri]
 66:  979| [45] ["Once you know the truth, there might be no going back, okay? Are you still sure you want to know?"]
 67:  987| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  990| [45] ["... Fine by me."]
 69:  998| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1001| [45] ["Tell me, Yuuri. Tell me what exactly is going on here."]
 71: 1006| [45] [Yuuri quietly began to answer Natsuhiko's question.]
 72: 1032| [47] [Yuuri]
 73: 1035| [45] ["... I'll take it all one thing at a time, okay?"]
 74: 1043| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1046| [45] ["First, I'll tell you exactly what a 'WX particle' is--"]
 76: 1054| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1057| [45] ["But before I get into that, you do know what 'BC particles' are, right, Hikorin?"]
 78: 1065| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1068| [45] ["Huh? Ah, yeah."]
 80: 1121| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, he remembered what he learned from a class they had earlier.]
 81: 1168| [47] [Ena]
 82: 1171| [45] ["The 'BC particle'-- that's the general term for the elementary particle related to the use of BC."]
 83: 1179| [47] [Ena]
 84: 1182| [45] ["They're elementary particles that are molded and transmitted by the brain activity of all living animals, and thus humans."]
 85: 1190| [47] [Ena]
 86: 1193| [45] ["First of all, these 'BC particles' I've mentioned fill our surroundings and have the capability to move through all matter."]
 87: 1201| [47] [Ena]
 88: 1204| [45] ["Which of course includes your skulls and your brains within..."]
 89: 1212| [47] [Ena]
 90: 1215| [45] ["Also, brain activity itself is 'thought information' which is generated by the brain's electrical signals."]
 91: 1223| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1226| [45] ["This 'thought information' is transmittable to the outside."]
 93: 1260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1263| [45] ["I know, but what about them...?"]
 95: 1268| [45] [It was right after he said those words that Natsuhiko picked up on Yuuri's implication.]
 96: 1273| [45] [LABO was a BC research facility, so for her to bring up BC particles meant--]
 97: 1299| [47] [Yuuri]
 98: 1302| [45] ["WX particles are a type of BC particle."]
 99: 1310| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1313| [45] ["The amount of information, that is to say, the amount of energy transmitted by BC particles normally increases when a Communicator uses BC, but..."]
101: 1321| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1324| [45] ["The 'WX particle amplifier' can mechanically amplify that energy even in the absence of a Communicator."]
103: 1332| [47] [Yuuri]
104: 1335| [45] ["The BC particles are put into a state of blank information, but extremely high energy, which gives them distinct properties."]
105: 1343| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1346| [45] ["In this state, they're called 'W-eXtreme particles', or WX particles for short."]
107: 1351| [45] [--Now that she mentioned it, Natsuhiko's mother did talk about something like that in Yuuri's memories.]
108: 1403| [45] [She'd said that BC particles written with information were called "M particles". Particles not written with information were called "W particles".]
109: 1408| [45] [From what Natsuhiko could surmise, it appeared that WX particles were derived from W particles...]
110: 1416| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1419| [45] ["When you say they have distinct properties, what exactly do you mean?"]
112: 1452| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 1455| [45] ["First of all, in conditions where WX particles are spread about, the efficiency of BC usage rapidly increases."]
114: 1463| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1466| [45] ["For example, they amplify even the weakest of telepathy to strong telepathy."]
116: 1474| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1477| [45] ["They also allow BC to be used continuously for an extended amount of time."]
118: 1503| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1506| [45] ["For example, Hikorin, even though today was the first time you used Senses Sympathy, you were able to remain connected to Captain Kasasagi for over six hours, right?"]
120: 1514| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1517| [45] ["Ah...!"]
122: 1522| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, it was quite an amazing feat for him to have pulled off.]
123: 1527| [45] [Especially considering how it took Yuuri an entire month of training as a child to obtain the same ability Natsuhiko obtained in a flash.]
124: 1532| [45] [Natsuhiko's BC ability did indeed advance rapidly-- but apparently he had at least some backing from these WX particles.]
125: 1540| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1543| [45] ["LABO used the WX particle amplifier to conduct various research and development relating to BC abilities."]
127: 1600| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1603| [45] ["But you see, it's difficult to use that machine."]
129: 1611| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1614| [45] ["Machine operation and energy management must be controlled via supercomputer..."]
131: 1622| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1625| [45] ["... But today, they lost control of it."]
133: 1680| [47] [Yuuri]
134: 1683| [45] ["The WX particle amplifier went haywire."]
135: 1691| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1694| [45] ["Haywire?"]
137: 1699| [45] [Yuuri quietly nodded.]
138: 1732| [47] [Yuuri]
139: 1735| [45] ["I don't know the cause, but an abnormal situation arose where 'WX particle generation continued for hours'."]
140: 1761| [47] [Yuuri]
141: 1764| [45] ["That is the truth behind what's going on in this facility."]
142: 1773| [47] [Yuuri]
143: 1776| [45] ["The phenomenon labeled a 'meltdown' was the unbridled generation of WX particles which spread throughout the facility."]
144: 1784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 1787| [45] ["So that's what it was...!"]
146: 1792| [45] [So it really wasn't a nuclear reactor meltdown at all.]
147: 1797| [45] [It was apparently just a one-word shorthand for "extremely high-energy BC particle proliferation".]
148: 1852| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 1855| [45] ["So then the Procyon's readings... are actually a measurement of BC particle energy?"]
150: 1864| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 1867| [45] ["That's correct, Hikorin. The Procyon isn't an instrument for measuring radiation exposure,%Nbut BC energy."]
152: 1875| [47] [Yuuri]
153: 1878| [45] ["It's a device that measures and quantifies the amount of energy in the BC and WX particles in that area."]
154: 1887| [47] [Yuuri]
155: 1890| [45] ["Incidentally, mSv doesn't stand for millisieverts in the case: rather, it stands for milliscalar value."]
156: 1898| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 1901| [45] ["A unit of information energy contained in BC particles."]
158: 1931| [45] [As he listened to Yuuri's explanation, Natsuhiko gradually understood more and more about LABO:]
159: 1936| [45] [LABO wasn't merely misrepresenting itself as a nuclear power research institution in name.]
160: 1941| [45] [Several parts of their research coincided with nuclear power science here and there.]
161: 1949| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1952| [45] ["... Was the identical abbreviation intentional? Or just a coincidence?"]
163: 1978| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 1981| [45] ["It was intentional, of course."]
165: 1989| [47] [Yuuri]
166: 1992| [45] ["Everything that could potentially be handed over to third parties, like the Procyon and AD, were designed to be disguised as things relating to nuclear power."]
167: 2018| [47] [Yuuri]
168: 2021| [45] ["All as part of the efforts that went into hiding the truth of LABO from society."]
169: 2026| [45] [Now that Natsuhiko thought about it, that was right. There were probably several more similar countermeasures against industrial espionage in place.]
170: 2031| [45] [Such as the use of several secret codewords like "Case N", "meltdown", and "AD".]
171: 2036| [45] [LABO had been carefully hiding its true nature in consideration of worst case scenarios like this one.]
172: 2091| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2094| [45] ["... Let's get back on topic. If the Procyon is a BC energy measuring instrument, then what's AD?"]
174: 2102| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 2105| [45] ["AD is a drug that absorbs and neutralizes BC particle energy."]
176: 2113| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 2116| [45] ["As for its effects--"]
178: 2124| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 2127| [45] ["First: it prevents you from using BC."]
180: 2135| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2138| [45] ["Second: it prevents other people's BC from affecting you."]
182: 2171| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 2174| [45] ["In other words, it's a drug that protects your mind and body from other people's BC at the cost of your own. That is what AD is."]
184: 2182| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2185| [45] ["I see. So that's what happened to me back then...!"]
186: 2190| [45] [Natsuhiko remembered.]
187: 2195| [45] [When his mind was connected to Watase's, Natsuhiko would sink into the darkness whenever Watase injected himself with AD.]
188: 2200| [45] [It wasn't that Natsuhiko's sensations would cut off; it was that Watase, the BC target, would become temporarily immune to the effects of BC.]
189: 2205| [45] [Natsuhiko's mind would try to connect with Watase's, but AD would reject it.]
190: 2210| [45] [As a result, Natsuhiko would be unable to receive any of the information that Watase's mind was supposed to be sending--]
191: 2215| [45] [--and so without any information, Natsuhiko would be thrown into the darkness.]
192: 2223| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2226| [45] ["Is it true that its effective period is an hour?"]
194: 2252| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 2255| [45] ["It is. So is the fact that AD is effective in environments under 4000 mSv."]
196: 2263| [47] [Yuuri]
197: 2266| [45] ["Conversely speaking, that means that when BC energy surpasses 4000 mSv, the effects of AD disappear."]
198: 2274| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 2277| [45] ["You're once again prone to the influence of other people's BC, and if you're a Communicator, you can use BC again as well."]
200: 2282| [45] [That would explain why Natsuhiko's consciousness returned every time Watase went into a contaminated zone.]
201: 2287| [45] [And how the two of them remained constantly connected once the facility's mSv value rose past 4000 mSv--]
202: 2292| [45] [Both were a result of the conflict between BC, the "power to connect people"%Nand AD, "the drug that resists the power".]
203: 2300| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 2303| [45] ["... Ah, but now that you mention it..."]
205: 2329| [47] [Yuuri]
206: 2332| [45] ["What is it?"]
207: 2340| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 2343| [45] ["Why was the amount of energy in the facility gradually rising?"]
209: 2352| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 2355| [45] ["Well you see, that's because the 'BC insulator' could no longer keep absorbing the WX particle energy."]
211: 2363| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 2366| [45] ["Huh?"]
213: 2371| [45] [Natsuhiko knew about BC insulators.]
214: 2423| [45] [He'd even had a conversation about them with Salyu just a few days ago.]
215: 2466| [47] [Salyu]
216: 2469| [45] ["Why do we have to move to a specialized classroom for BC classes?"]
217: 2477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 2480| [45] ["The BC room's walls are made with a 'BC insulator', a special building material meant to block out BC."]
219: 2497| [45] [As Natsuhiko remembered that exchange, Yuuri continued.]
220: 2553| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 2556| [45] ["Actually, all the walls and security gates in this facility are made with 'BC insulators'."]
222: 2564| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 2567| [45] ["You know how BC insulators obstruct BC? They do that by absorbing the energy from BC particles."]
224: 2575| [47] [Yuuri]
225: 2578| [45] ["WX particles are a subclass of BC particles, so they're no exception."]
226: 2586| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 2589| [45] ["The energy from the WX particles generated in Area N is being absorbed by the surrounding walls and security gates."]
228: 2622| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 2625| [45] ["But there's a limit to how much they can absorb. If they're continuously exposed to WX particles, their absorptivity gradually wears down."]
230: 2633| [47] [Yuuri]
231: 2636| [45] ["As the absorptivity decreases, the amount of energy from the WX particles leaking out of Area N increases proportionally--"]
232: 2644| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 2647| [45] ["Which is why the Procyon's value has been gradually rising."]
234: 2655| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2658| [45] ["Then what's with the disparity in values across the areas? Why did places like Area 4 have higher values than other areas?"]
236: 2713| [47] [Yuuri]
237: 2716| [45] ["Hmm... Probably because the fires and explosions here and there caused damage to the BC insulators, I guess?"]
238: 2724| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 2727| [45] ["The insulators in the more heavily damaged areas suffered further decreased absorptivity... causing WX particle energy to rise even further."]
240: 2732| [45] [--Now that Natsuhiko thought about it, that did sound plausible.]
241: 2782| [45] [B2 of Area 4, the most heavily contaminated area, had been horribly damaged by fire.]
242: 2787| [45] [Considering how much it had burned, a good majority of the insulator must have been damaged.]
243: 2792| [45] [The next highly contaminated area, B2 of Area 5, was right next to Area 4, and so the contamination may have spread all the way over there.]
244: 2797| [45] [There was no definitive proof, but Yuuri's conjecture seemed plausible enough.]
245: 2830| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 2833| [45] ["Wow, Yuuri... You seem to know just about everything about this facility."]
247: 2859| [47] [Yuuri]
248: 2862| [45] ["Eheheh, well, I -have- lived here for over nine years, after all. It's only natural that I know a lot."]
249: 2888| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 2891| [45] ["... Though I may have been locked up in here, it is technically where I live. I have grown a little attached to it."]
251: 2896| [45] [Yuuri gave an ambivalent smile.]
252: 2901| [45] [Her smile pained Natsuhiko's heart as he asked more questions.]
253: 2909| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 2912| [45] ["Thanks to you, I now understand more or less what LABO is and what WX particles are, but--"]
255: 2920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 2923| [45] ["There's another important thing. What are the dangers of WX particles?"]
257: 2984| [47] [Yuuri]
258: 2987| [45] ["...!"]
259: 2995| [47] [Natsuhiko]
260: 2998| [45] ["The amplifier's manual said that WX particles were harmful to the body."]
261: 3006| [47] [Natsuhiko]
262: 3009| [45] ["And when Watase and the others went somewhere with a high Procyon reading, they displayed strange symptoms."]
263: 3060| [45] [Natsuhiko recalled the contents of the manual that Watase and Kazami had found in the engine room.]
264: 3065| [45] [It had said the following:]
265: 3103| [45] [--the properties of WX particles have extremely harmful effects to the body.]
266: 3106| [45] [Examples of this include dysesthesia, brain dysfunctions, genetic abnormalities, etc.]
267: 3109| [45] [The symptoms are dependent on the level of particle energy, as listed below:]
268: 3113| [45] ["WX particle amplifier operation manual"]

272: 3125| [45] [This document is an instruction manual for the WX particle amplifier.]
273: 3128| [45] [Due to the fact that there is great danger involved in its operation,%Nplease read the manual carefully before you proceed.]
274: 3131| [85] [ã€€]
275: 3134| [45] [Furthermore, the properties of WX particles have extremely harmful effects to the body.]
276: 3137| [45] [Examples of this include dysesthesia, brain dysfunctions, genetic abnormalities, etc.]
277: 3140| [45] [The symptoms are dependent on the level of particle energy, as listed below:]
278: 3144| [45] [<Without AD>]
279: 3147| [85] [ã€€]
280: 3150| [45] [      0 mSv-2000 mSv: No effects]

286: 3168| [45] [8000 mSv-: unconsciousness]
287: 3171| [85] [ã€€]
288: 3174| [45] [(The intensity and probability of displaying the aforementioned symptoms vary depending on the energy levels.)]
289: 3178| [45] [<With AD>]
290: 3181| [85] [ã€€]
291: 3184| [45] [      0 mSv-6000 mSv : No effects]

298: 3205| [85] [ã€€]
299: 3208| [45] [(*AD adds up to 4000 mSv of protection, hence the increased levels)]
300: 3212| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%Nã€€%Nã€€%N]
301: 3215| [45] [When using the amplifier normally, the particle energy levels should not exceed 2000 mSv.]
302: 3218| [85] [ã€€]
303: 3221| [45] [When used for advanced experiments, the particle energy levels should not exceed 4000 mSv.]
304: 3275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
305: 3278| [45] ["Hey, Yuuri... is it true that WX particles cause brain dysfunction and cancer?"]
306: 3286| [47] [Yuuri]
307: 3289| [45] ["Yes. They may not be radioactive, but they are still dangerous nonetheless."]
308: 3297| [47] [Yuuri]
309: 3300| [45] ["WX particles with enormous amounts of energy enter and affect the brain, causing various brain dysfunctions."]
310: 3308| [47] [Yuuri]
311: 3311| [45] ["Furthermore, they can also affect the genes, causing mutations and cancer..."]
312: 3337| [47] [Yuuri]
313: 3340| [45] ["Perhaps that's why even Mr. Ukita was afraid of the values increasing, despite how he should be fully aware of the facility's true nature."]
314: 3345| [45] [That in itself wasn't strange.]
315: 3350| [45] [What truly was strange was--]
316: 3358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
317: 3361| [45] ["But then how come I didn't suffer any negative effects from staying in Area N for so long?"]
318: 3369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
319: 3372| [45] ["I'm still perfectly fine now, and you seem fine to me too."]
320: 3380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
321: 3383| [45] ["I don't think I've gotten any 'genetic disorders' or 'brain dysfunction', but... why's that?"]
322: 3388| [45] [Melancholy shrouded Yuuri's face when she heard Natsuhiko's question.]
323: 3414| [47] [Yuuri]
324: 3417| [45] ["... We're okay, Hikorin."]
325: 3425| [47] [Yuuri]
326: 3428| [45] ["You and I are the only ones trapped in this place who will remain unaffected no matter how high the WX particle reading gets."]
327: 3436| [47] [Yuuri]
328: 3439| [45] ["It's because we have Rank S Aptitude, you see."]
329: 3447| [47] [Natsuhiko]
330: 3450| [45] ["...? What does that have to do with it?"]
331: 3476| [47] [Yuuri]
332: 3479| [45] ["The truth is, the negative effects of WX particles occur more easily the lower your BC 'aptitude' is."]
333: 3487| [47] [Yuuri]
334: 3490| [45] ["That's because WX particle resistance is proportional to BC aptitude."]
335: 3498| [47] [Yuuri]
336: 3501| [45] ["People with Rank F Aptitude have no resistance to WX particles whatsoever, but those of us with Rank S Aptitude have complete resistance."]
337: 3509| [47] [Yuuri]
338: 3512| [45] ["Our brains and genes are unaffected by the effects of WX particles."]
339: 3538| [47] [Yuuri]
340: 3541| [45] ["... It's because of what happened nine years ago that we became like this."]
341: 3549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 3552| [45] ["Huh? Nine years ago--"]
343: 3560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
344: 3563| [45] ["So you mean the reason our aptitudes rose so high had something to do with WX particles?"]
345: 3568| [45] [Yuuri nodded.]
346: 3623| [47] [Yuuri]
347: 3626| [45] ["... When WX particles contact the human body, they first cause a strong influence on the brain, causing various functional disorders."]
348: 3679| [47] [Yuuri]
349: 3682| [45] ["The headaches and vomiting are a result of those disorders. The same goes for the numbness of skin and other symptoms."]
350: 3690| [47] [Yuuri]
351: 3693| [45] ["When the particles come in contact with genes, they damage them."]
352: 3701| [47] [Natsuhiko]
353: 3704| [45] ["They damage genes!?"]
354: 3737| [47] [Yuuri]
355: 3740| [45] ["Yes. Though many other things besides WX particles have that effect, such as radiation, particle beams, and electromagnetic waves."]
356: 3748| [47] [Yuuri]
357: 3751| [45] ["In any case, once gene damage occurs, the body quickly works to repair that damage."]
358: 3777| [47] [Yuuri]
359: 3780| [45] ["Prolonged exposure to WX particles can overwhelm the repair process, causing fatal damage, but..."]
360: 3788| [47] [Yuuri]
361: 3791| [45] ["With endless cycles of damage and repair-- the human body has, on rare occasions, gained resistance to WX particles."]
362: 3799| [47] [Yuuri]
363: 3802| [45] ["The brain also changes accordingly, and the functional disorders cease."]
364: 3828| [47] [Yuuri]
365: 3831| [45] ["And as resistance rises, aptitude rises in proportion..."]
366: 3839| [47] [Yuuri]
367: 3842| [45] ["That was the process both your body and mine underwent when our aptitudes rose to Rank S nine years ago."]
368: 3850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
369: 3853| [45] ["I see... Well, that finally puts that old mystery to rest."]
370: 3858| [45] [Normally, aptitude doesn't change throughout one's lifetime.]
371: 3910| [45] [But Natsuhiko and Yuuri were an exception because their bodies were flooded with WX particles during the fire nine years ago.]
372: 3918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 3921| [45] ["So that's why you didn't like taking AD, huh."]
374: 3929| [47] [Natsuhiko]
375: 3932| [45] ["Because you didn't need it to begin with, and all it did was prevent you from using BC."]
376: 3965| [47] [Yuuri]
377: 3968| [45] ["Yes..."]
378: 3976| [47] [Natsuhiko]
379: 3979| [45] ["So if the two of us go to Area N, we won't get cancer or anything?"]
380: 4005| [47] [Yuuri]
381: 4008| [45] ["Right... as in we won't get any worse than we already are, that is..."]
382: 4016| [47] [Natsuhiko]
383: 4019| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
384: 4024| [45] [Natsuhiko had a terrifying feeling about what she was implying.]
385: 4029| [45] [For he felt that Yuuri was trying to tell him about the real danger of WX particles.]
386: 4037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 4040| [45] ["Any worse than we already are...? What do you mean?"]
388: 4066| [47] [Yuuri]
389: 4069| [45] ["Think carefully about what I just said, okay...?"]
390: 4077| [47] [Yuuri]
391: 4080| [45] ["Having high aptitude means your genes have changed so that you can withstand an environment that normal people cannot."]
392: 4106| [47] [Yuuri]
393: 4109| [45] ["Your genes have gone through endless cycles of damage and repair, bringing them further and further away from their original form..."]
394: 4135| [47] [Yuuri]
395: 4138| [45] ["So, in other words--... stay calm and listen closely, Hikorin..."]
396: 4146| [47] [Yuuri]
397: 4149| [45] ["You and I already have considerable genetic abnormalities."]
398: 4175| [47] [Yuuri]
399: 4178| [45] ["You may even go so far as to say that all Communicators in general are the result of genetic abnormalities."]
400: 4201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
401: 4204| [45] ["!!"]
402: 4231| [47] [Yuuri]
403: 4234| [45] ["What determines whether or not somebody is a Communicator is the IGF2R gene.%NThis gene relates to the structure of the brain."]
404: 4242| [47] [Yuuri]
405: 4245| [45] ["Normally, there are nine types of IGF2R genes, numbered 1 through 9."]
406: 4253| [47] [Yuuri]
407: 4256| [45] ["But on rare occasion, people are born with a mutant variant form of that gene..."]
408: 4264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
409: 4267| [45] ["And those are Communicators...?"]
410: 4293| [47] [Yuuri]
411: 4296| [45] ["Yes."]
412: 4301| [45] [The tone of Yuuri's voice gradually grew dispirited.]
413: 4327| [47] [Yuuri]
414: 4330| [45] ["There are six degrees of IGF2R gene abnormalities."]
415: 4338| [47] [Yuuri]
416: 4341| [45] ["Depending on the extent of variation, IGF2R genes can also be ranked from Type E to Type S."]
417: 4349| [47] [Yuuri]
418: 4352| [45] ["As I've explained before, aptitude and resistance are directly proportional, but--"]
419: 4360| [47] [Yuuri]
420: 4363| [45] ["Basically, both things just point to how those IGF2R genes are mutated variants.%NThat's the truth behind aptitude."]
421: 4371| [47] [Yuuri]
422: 4374| [45] ["IGF2R Gene Type E corresponds with Rank E Aptitude. Type D with Rank D... all the way to Type S with Rank S."]
423: 4400| [47] [Yuuri]
424: 4403| [45] ["And the higher one's aptitude... the more severe one's mutation..."]
425: 4411| [47] [Yuuri]
426: 4414| [45] ["And the shorter that Communicator's lifespan becomes--"]
427: 4439| [47] [Natsuhiko]
428: 4442| [45] ["...!!"]
429: 4447| [45] [A chill ran down Natsuhiko's spine.]
430: 4452| [45] [And yet Yuuri kept painfully speaking the harsh truth.]
431: 4484| [47] [Yuuri]
432: 4487| [45] ["Communicators are extremely prone to cancer. The same goes for all sorts of neurological diseases."]
433: 4495| [47] [Yuuri]
434: 4498| [45] ["Though they may not show it when they're young, as Communicators age, their likelihood of death rapidly increases."]
435: 4506| [47] [Yuuri]
436: 4509| [45] ["So now do you understand... what I meant when I said we wouldn't get any worse?"]
437: 4517| [47] [Yuuri]
438: 4520| [45] ["We were already burdened with a premature death sentence nine years ago."]
439: 4528| [47] [Yuuri]
440: 4531| [45] ["It's only been 16 years since the Grand Communicator Discovery. That's why most people in the world have yet to realize this fact..."]
441: 4539| [47] [Yuuri]
442: 4542| [45] ["Most of the scant few Communicators who were born before the Grand Discovery have already died."]
443: 4568| [47] [Yuuri]
444: 4571| [45] ["I heard from the professor that your father was also a Communicator."]
445: 4579| [47] [Yuuri]
446: 4582| [45] ["Furthermore, he was a Rank B Aptitude Communicator, an even rarer existence at the time. That's why he died at the age of 32..."]
447: 4590| [47] [Natsuhiko]
448: 4593| [45] ["No way...!"]
449: 4601| [47] [Natsuhiko]
450: 4604| [45] ["If LABO knows about that truth, then why haven't they announced it!?"]
451: 4630| [47] [Yuuri]
452: 4633| [45] ["Can they? They haven't even completely figured out the cause of the premature deaths."]
453: 4659| [47] [Yuuri]
454: 4662| [45] ["If they made the announcement regardless... then all the Communicators would surely despair over the looming fate of death."]
455: 4685| [47] [Natsuhiko]
456: 4688| [45] ["..."]
457: 4693| [45] [Natsuhiko choked on his words.]
458: 4726| [47] [Natsuhiko]
459: 4727| [45] [(So that means we're already--)]
460: 4732| [45] [Even if they escaped from the facility, they still wouldn't have long lives ahead of them.]
461: 4737| [45] [Their remaining lives would be shorter than his father's 32 years on this earth.]
462: 4742| [47] [Natsuhiko]
463: 4743| [45] [(15 years? 10 years? ... Just how much longer do we have left to live!?)]
464: 4748| [45] [Natsuhiko was horribly agitated by the hopeless truth.]
465: 4753| [45] [Feelings of nothingness rended his heart into pieces.]
466: 4758| [45] [He held his head with a trembling hand.]
467: 4763| [45] [But at that moment--]
468: 4768| [45] [He saw a wristwatch in the corner of his eye.]
469: 4773| [47] [Natsuhiko]
470: 4774| [45] [(...!)]
471: 4841| [45] [His father's watch.]
472: 4846| [45] [When his mother gave this watch to Natsuhiko, she may have already known about his fate as a Communicator.]
473: 4851| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa cried back then, despite rarely ever crying. Natsuhiko felt like that was perhaps the most telling sign of her emotions.]
474: 4858| [45] [But even so--]
475: 4863| [47] [Natsuhiko]
476: 4864| [45] [(Dad told me to 'be strong'...!)]
477: 4869| [47] [Natsuhiko]
478: 4870| [45] [(He told me to become a man that can protect and support others!)]
479: 4875| [45] [His father's final message from that faraway day rekindled in Natsuhiko's mind.]
480: 4880| [45] [Natsuhiko took his crushed spirit and forced it back on its feet.]
481: 4911| [45] [He then looked at Yuuri and spoke.]
482: 4919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
483: 4922| [45] ["Yuuri... it's been tough bearing the knowledge of this truth all by yourself, hasn't it?"]
484: 4948| [47] [Yuuri]
485: 4951| [45] ["Huh... Hikorin... it's not tough for you?"]
486: 4959| [47] [Natsuhiko]
487: 4962| [45] ["Sure, it's a shock. To know that you and Mashiro might die premature deaths. That part's a lot tougher than knowing about my own death."]
488: 4970| [47] [Natsuhiko]
489: 4973| [45] ["But... so what? I can't just give up on life here and now just because of that, you know?"]
490: 4999| [47] [Yuuri]
491: 5002| [45] ["...!"]
492: 5010| [47] [Natsuhiko]
493: 5013| [45] ["It doesn't matter if our remaining life is long or short."]
494: 5021| [47] [Natsuhiko]
495: 5024| [45] ["Let's just live it all we can."]
496: 5032| [47] [Natsuhiko]
497: 5035| [45] ["You think so too, don't you, Yuuri?"]
498: 5043| [47] [Natsuhiko]
499: 5046| [45] ["That's why-- that's why you asked me to save you, wasn't it?"]
500: 5107| [47] [Yuuri]
501: 5110| [45] ["..."]
502: 5136| [47] [Yuuri]
503: 5139| [45] ["Y... yes!"]
504: 5144| [45] [The anxiety on Yuuri's face finally brightened up.]
505: 5149| [45] [Natsuhiko breathed a mental sigh of relief, then spoke up in a firm voice.]
506: 5157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
507: 5160| [45] ["Then to do that-- we need to do something about all the unsolved mysteries!"]
508: 5186| [47] [Yuuri]
509: 5189| [45] ["What do you mean by 'unsolved mysteries'--?"]
510: 5244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
511: 5247| [45] ["First, the bulkheads."]
512: 5255| [47] [Natsuhiko]
513: 5258| [45] ["Why have the bulkheads remained locked down? Since there's no radioactive material,%Nit wouldn't spread outside even if the bulkheads opened, right?"]
514: 5266| [47] [Yuuri]
515: 5269| [45] ["Hmm, honestly I'm not quite sure about that myself, but..."]
516: 5302| [47] [Yuuri]
517: 5305| [45] ["I think it's probably to prevent the test subjects from escaping."]
518: 5313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
519: 5316| [45] ["Huh?"]
520: 5324| [47] [Yuuri]
521: 5327| [45] ["It would be a huge incident if a test subject took advantage of a fire to escape from LABO, right?"]
522: 5335| [47] [Natsuhiko]
523: 5338| [45] ["So you mean 'Case N' refers to a system that prevents your escape, Yuuri?"]
524: 5364| [47] [Yuuri]
525: 5367| [45] ["No, not just my escape-- I think they had another girl in mind too."]
526: 5375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
527: 5378| [45] ["... Another one?"]
528: 5383| [45] [Yuuri proceeded to answer Natsuhiko's question without the slighest hesitation.]
529: 5438| [47] [Yuuri]
530: 5441| [45] ["... You know too, don't you, Hikorin? A girl died by the cargo lift."]
531: 5449| [47] [Yuuri]
532: 5452| [45] ["That girl may have been a test subject confined in LABO just like me."]
533: 5475| [47] [Natsuhiko]
534: 5478| [45] ["!!"]
535: 5528| [45] [--Now that she mentioned it, he remembered.]
536: 5533| [45] [One of the casualties found in the facility had been a lone girl of unknown origin.]
537: 5541| [47] [Yuuri]
538: 5544| [45] ["I've heard that there was another test subject in LABO besides me."]
539: 5552| [47] [Yuuri]
540: 5555| [45] ["She was wearing testing clothes, so I'm sure it was her...!"]
541: 5563| [47] [Natsuhiko]
542: 5566| [45] ["So the bulkheads weren't to prevent just your escape, but hers as well...!?"]
543: 5599| [47] [Yuuri]
544: 5602| [45] ["Yeah... though I don't know the reason why the lockdown has gone on for so long..."]
545: 5607| [45] [What Yuuri didn't know was probably whatever LABO thought would be bad for her to know.]
546: 5612| [45] [What exactly was a "Case N"-- That had been a mystery up until now.]
547: 5620| [47] [Natsuhiko]
548: 5623| [45] ["... In any case, that means the terrorists with Watase got locked in here thanks to that Case N announcement, right?"]
549: 5649| [47] [Yuuri]
550: 5652| [45] ["But something about that just doesn't sound right... Perhaps it was a fluke or something..."]
551: 5660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
552: 5663| [45] ["What exactly was their original goal...?"]
553: 5668| [45] [Judging by Q's ideology and creed, there would probably be no greater target than the world's strongest Communicator, Yuuri.]
554: 5673| [45] [And yet Watase said that his goal wasn't to kill Yuuri.]
555: 5678| [45] [He injected her with AD and left her where she was.]
556: 5686| [47] [Natsuhiko]
557: 5689| [45] ["I still don't quite understand what it was the terrorists were thinking..."]
558: 5715| [47] [Yuuri]
559: 5718| [45] ["What if you restored Captain Kasasagi's memory?"]
560: 5726| [47] [Natsuhiko]
561: 5729| [45] ["I probably could if I wanted, but we shouldn't."]
562: 5784| [47] [Natsuhiko]
563: 5787| [45] ["Before he lost his memory, Watase was homicidal and full of malice. He could very well turn out like that again."]
564: 5792| [45] [In truth, that vast malice had threatened to come back several times already.]
565: 5797| [45] [Just a small peek of the erased memories could potentially cause Watase to become ferocious again.]
566: 5802| [45] [After all, peeking into Watase's memories meant making him remember them.]
567: 5835| [47] [Yuuri]
568: 5838| [45] ["... But still, it's weird."]
569: 5846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
570: 5849| [45] ["What is?"]
571: 5904| [47] [Yuuri]
572: 5907| [45] ["After he lost his memories, Captain Kasasagi... was such a nice person."]
573: 5915| [47] [Yuuri]
574: 5918| [45] ["He didn't seem like the same man who strangled me at all."]
575: 5926| [47] [Natsuhiko]
576: 5929| [45] ["... True."]
577: 5937| [47] [Yuuri]
578: 5940| [45] ["It may have been because you were inside his mind, though..."]
579: 5945| [47] [Natsuhiko]
580: 5946| [45] ["..."]
581: 5996| [45] [True enough, Watase had been straining to save everyone like a true rescue worker.]
582: 6046| [45] [But even if Watase were a good man, the second he regained his memories, he could very well lose that character.]
583: 6051| [47] [Natsuhiko]
584: 6052| [45] [(But... is it okay to leave him as is...?)]
585: 6057| [47] [Natsuhiko]
586: 6058| [45] [(How long can we keep him in this unnatural state?)]
587: 6063| [45] [--Needless to say, it would be difficult.]
588: 6152| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa had said it herself in Yuuri's memories:]
589: 6157| [45] [Memories erased with Senses Sympathy could return if given the chance.]
590: 6209| [45] [And Watase nearly regained his memories several times.]
591: 6214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
592: 6215| [45] [(But in that case... what do I do...!?)]
593: 6231| [45] [As soon as that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind-- they heard a sound from outside the door.]
594: 6245| [47] [Watase]
595: 6248| [45] ["Natsuhiko, it's me! Please open up!"]
596: 6253| [45] [It was Watase's voice.]
597: 6258| [47] [Natsuhiko]
598: 6259| [45] [(Did he bring Salyu with him?)]
599: 6333| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed to the keypad beside the door and entered the password.]
600: 6338| [45] [Upon which, Watase appeared.]
601: 6398| [47] [Watase]
602: 6401| [45] ["... Sorry I'm late."]
603: 6406| [45] [Watase spoke sadly as he entered the shelter.]
604: 6411| [45] [And oddly-- he was alone.]
605: 6419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
606: 6422| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi... where's Salyu?"]
607: 6450| [47] [Watase]
608: 6453| [45] ["... She was gone."]
609: 6461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
610: 6464| [45] ["Huh!?"]
611: 6490| [47] [Watase]
612: 6493| [45] ["I went to the emergency staircase where she fell, but she wasn't there."]
613: 6498| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
