  1:   69| [45] [However-- Ena spoke up in an exasperated voice when she saw Watase trembling.]
  2:   95| [47] [Ena]
  3:   98| [45] ["For crying out loud... I'm so disappointed in you."]
  4:  106| [47] [Watase]
  5:  109| [45] ["Huh...?"]
  6:  135| [47] [Ena]
  7:  138| [45] ["I mean, you said you trust me--"]
  8:  164| [47] [Ena]
  9:  167| [45] ["But that doesn't hold any water when you clearly don't trust yourself."]
 10:  175| [47] [Watase]
 11:  178| [45] ["S-sorry..."]
 12:  204| [47] [Ena]
 13:  207| [45] ["Stop it. Don't let me see you with that look of despair on your face."]
 14:  233| [47] [Ena]
 15:  236| [45] ["You are indeed suspicious-- your amnesia and the security footage attest to that."]
 16:  244| [47] [Ena]
 17:  247| [45] ["But even when I take that into account, I want to trust you."]
 18:  273| [47] [Ena]
 19:  276| [45] ["And yet here you are, assuming your own guilt without proof..."]
 20:  284| [47] [Watase]
 21:  287| [45] ["... But I don't have any memories of my past, you know?"]
 22:  295| [47] [Watase]
 23:  298| [45] ["If my past self was someone who held malice in his heart--"]
 24:  324| [47] [Ena]
 25:  327| [45] ["It doesn't matter who your past self was."]
 26:  335| [47] [Ena]
 27:  338| [45] ["The indisputable truth is that you have been pushing yourself to your limits to save people."]
 28:  364| [47] [Ena]
 29:  367| [45] ["Are you saying you can't trust what I say ever after I saw all that?"]
 30:  372| [47] [Watase]
 31:  373| [45] ["..."]
 32:  399| [47] [Ena]
 33:  402| [45] ["I see... so words alone won't do it, huh..."]
 34:  410| [47] [Ena]
 35:  413| [45] ["Fine then. Then let's try something besides words."]
 36:  447| [45] [Ena put her hands on Watase's shoulders as she said that--]
 37:  563| [47] [Watase]
 38:  564| [45] [(...!!)]
 39:  569| [45] [Watase froze on instinct when he saw Ena's face approaching him.]
 40:  574| [45] [However-- Ena suddenly stopped just before their noses could come in contact with each other.]
 41:  625| [47] [Ena]
 42:  628| [45] ["H-hey... it's considered rude not to close your eyes at a time like this, right?"]
 43:  636| [47] [Watase]
 44:  639| [45] ["Ah, no, uh..."]
 45:  687| [47] [Ena]
 46:  690| [45] ["--Look, just shut them already! Are you -trying- to embarrass me!?"]
 47:  695| [45] [Watase frantically shut his eyes.]
 48:  743| [45] [He felt a soft sensation against his lips.]
 49:  748| [45] [Ena's lips were trembling ever so slightly.]
 50:  798| [45] [Watase opened his eyes to find Ena staring at him with a nervous look on her face.]
 51:  806| [47] [Ena]
 52:  809| [45] ["Well? You convinced now?"]
 53:  817| [47] [Ena]
 54:  820| [45] ["That's my way of saying I trust you from the bottom of my heart."]
 55:  825| [45] [Watase had no clue what he should say.]
 56:  830| [45] [Without his memories, it was essentially the first kiss of his life.]
 57:  835| [45] [Ena swiftly looked away as if she could tell what Watase was thinking.]
 58:  883| [47] [Ena]
 59:  886| [45] ["D-don't get me wrong... this is, uh, how do I put it... like a charm, yeah."]
 60:  894| [47] [Watase]
 61:  897| [45] ["A charm?"]
 62:  902| [45] [Ena let out a slightly lonely laugh when she heard that and continued.]
 63:  950| [47] [Ena]
 64:  953| [45] ["Yes, one to give you back the confidence you need."]
 65:  961| [47] [Ena]
 66:  964| [45] ["It worked, didn't it? I thought it was quite generous."]
 67:  969| [45] [Watase didn't understand the meaning of the smile Ena was giving him.]
 68:  974| [45] [But those feelings she was showing him were the real thing.]
 69:  982| [47] [Watase]
 70:  985| [45] ["Yeah... thanks, Teach."]
 71:  993| [47] [Watase]
 72:  996| [45] ["I'll believe in the 'current me' that you believe in."]
 73: 1001| [45] [There was someone out there who truly believed in him when even he couldn't believe in himself--]
 74: 1006| [45] [Watase was grateful for that more than anything else right now.]
 75: 1011| [45] [And he felt like he could trust her with his life.]
 76: 1019| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1022| [45] ["Hey, Teach..."]
 78: 1030| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1033| [45] ["If the 'me' you know now vanishes forever and I turn out to be a black-hearted person when I get my memories back..."]
 80: 1041| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1044| [45] ["Will you stop me?"]
 82: 1089| [45] [Ena's face darkened for a second at those words.]
 83: 1094| [45] [However--]
 84: 1139| [45] [She gently smiled at him and nodded.]
 85: 1144| [45] [Watase's heart lightened at that moment, his reservations completely disappearing.]
