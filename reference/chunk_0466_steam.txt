  0:   53| [45] [--After Wataru suggested that the two of them start running together--]
  1:   58| [45] [Watase obeyed his sister's wishes and trained with her. That said, there wasn't much of a system to it aside from "run to some random spot in the city".]
  2:   63| [45] [Three months had passed since then...]
  3:  114| [45] [Watase and Wataru were running together on that Sunday morning to train up their stamina.]
  4:  183| [45] [They had run about 3 km away from their house when--]
  5:  225| [47] [Wataru]
  6:  228| [45] ["Wa-Watase, wait uuuup..."]
  7:  233| [45] [Wataru cried out to him.]
  8:  241| [47] [Watase]
  9:  244| [45] ["What's this? Need to take a break already? Boy, how lame."]
 10:  249| [45] [Watase stopped in his tracks, only to immediately hear his sister speak between her gasps for air.]
 11:  293| [47] [Wataru]
 12:  296| [45] ["Th-this isn't fair... How is there already such a huge gap in our stamina... even though we have the same face... and do the same training...?"]
 13:  304| [47] [Watase]
 14:  307| [45] ["Hell if I know. Could be our difference in gender, or maybe it's because we came from different eggs."]
 15:  333| [47] [Wataru]
 16:  336| [45] ["I-I refuse to accept that..."]
 17:  344| [47] [Watase]
 18:  347| [45] ["Well, anyway, I guess I am a bit thirsty, so sure, let's take a little break. I don't see why not."]
 19:  373| [47] [Wataru]
 20:  376| [45] ["Yaaay..."]
 21:  439| [45] [The twins walked up to a nearby vending machine and bought sports drinks.]
 22:  444| [45] [They rested up as they drank them down--]
 23:  449| [45] [--only to hear strange voices from somewhere.]
 24:  470| [47] [Man in Suit]
 25:  473| [45] ["--Citizens of Rokumei, lend me your ears!"]
 26:  478| [47] [Man in Suit]
 27:  481| [45] ["We are the citizen group known as the 'Anti-BC League'!"]
 28:  489| [47] [Watase]
 29:  492| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 30:  518| [47] [Wataru]
 31:  521| [45] ["What's all the commotion?"]
 32:  536| [45] [They looked to the direction of the voices to find men in suits standing in front of a building.]
 33:  541| [45] [One of them was giving some sort of speech with a megaphone in hand.]
 34:  546| [47] [Man in Suit]
 35:  549| [45] ["--We are the voices of all who object against the managers of the PRC!"]
 36:  554| [47] [Man in Suit]
 37:  557| [45] ["We the people have been forced to pay heavy taxes all in the name of researching this dubious technique known as BC--"]
 38:  562| [47] [Man in Suit]
 39:  565| [45] ["Are you content with turning a blind eye from this transgression without sufficient representation!?"]
 40:  570| [45] [The man was shouting while facing the people walking down the street-- no, facing the large building not too far from him.]
 41:  575| [45] [It was a big research facility that had been built nearly two years ago.]
 42:  585| [45] [It was the "Rokumei City Parapsychology Research Center", or "PRC" for short.]
 43:  590| [45] [It appeared they were giving a speech condemning the facility right in front of it.]
 44:  598| [47] [Watase]
 45:  601| [45] ["... The hell's this? What're they whining about?"]
 46:  629| [47] [Wataru]
 47:  632| [45] ["Oh... they must be that BC rejection citizen group that's been troubling the city recently."]
 48:  640| [47] [Watase]
 49:  643| [45] ["BC?"]
 50:  669| [47] [Wataru]
 51:  672| [45] ["You've never heard of it? It was all over the news."]
 52:  698| [47] [Wataru]
 53:  701| [45] ["A little while back, they scientifically proved that psychic powers like telepathy really exist."]
 54:  727| [47] [Wataru]
 55:  730| [45] ["It seems that such abilities like sending your voice to a faraway person or reading someone's mind were given the general term 'BC'."]
 56:  738| [47] [Watase]
 57:  741| [45] ["Oh yeah, I think I did hear about that..."]
 58:  746| [45] [Watase didn't watch TV, nor did he browse the internet all that much.]
 59:  751| [45] [Thus he only had a scarce knowledge of topics he wasn't all that interested in.]
 60:  759| [47] [Watase]
 61:  762| [45] ["So how exactly did they prove that this BC stuff actually exists?"]
 62:  788| [47] [Wataru]
 63:  791| [45] ["Uh, let's see... well, it started two years ago when a French scientist accidentally discovered the way in which a person's genes determine if they're capable of using psychic powers."]
 64:  817| [47] [Wataru]
 65:  820| [45] ["Well, people thought his theory was total BS at first--"]
 66:  846| [47] [Wataru]
 67:  849| [45] ["But early this year, the research team in the PRC made a great discovery that supported his theory."]
 68:  857| [47] [Watase]
 69:  860| [45] ["What great discovery?"]
 70:  868| [47] [Wataru]
 71:  871| [45] ["They discovered elementary particles now known as 'BC particles' that convey people's mental voices."]
 72:  879| [47] [Watase]
 73:  882| [45] ["Huh... mental voices, huh...?"]
 74:  908| [47] [Wataru]
 75:  911| [45] ["The PRC was in a huge uproar after that. They said it was a discovery that completely revolutionized the world of science, and that they would put all their efforts into researching it."]
 76:  937| [47] [Wataru]
 77:  940| [45] ["The Rokumei City council backed them up by deciding to invest truckloads of the city's budget into their research."]
 78:  948| [47] [Watase]
 79:  951| [45] ["Huh..."]
 80:  956| [45] [Watase kept responding disinterestedly.]
 81:  961| [45] [He found it somewhat comical how adults were getting so worked up over the research of something as much of an enigma as ESP.]
 82:  966| [47] [Watase]
 83:  967| [45] [(So that's what they do at this huge place...?)]
 84:  972| [45] [Watase looked towards the PRC as he thought that--]
 85:  977| [45] [--only to see a person in the facility.]
 86: 1176| [45] [A young woman was standing at a window on the 3rd floor.]
 87: 1181| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1182| [45] [(A blonde... Is she a foreigner?)]
 89: 1187| [45] [She looked down at the citizen group with dull eyes as they gave their speech.]
 90: 1192| [45] [The group continued to give their soapbox speech in a voice loud enough for the woman to hear it.]
 91: 1236| [47] [Man in Suit]
 92: 1239| [45] ["--BC users from all over the globe known as 'Communicators' have been gathering in our city ever since this spring due to the PRC's research--"]
 93: 1244| [47] [Man in Suit]
 94: 1247| [45] ["But where did the budget required to invite them all come from to begin with!?"]
 95: 1252| [47] [Man in Suit]
 96: 1255| [45] ["Is there even a need for this sort of research to be conducted in our beloved Rokumei City to begin with!?"]
 97: 1260| [47] [Man in Suit]
 98: 1263| [45] ["Well, we've got a message for you! Rokumei City does not need a BC research center!"]
 99: 1268| [47] [Man in Suit]
100: 1271| [45] ["We cannot acknowledge Communicators as official citizens without discussion!"]
101: 1354| [45] [Watase felt exasperated at their hysteric cries.]
102: 1362| [47] [Watase]
103: 1365| [45] ["... But why're these guys getting so mad?"]
104: 1373| [47] [Watase]
105: 1376| [45] ["The research at the PRC and the gathering of espers has nothing to do with them."]
106: 1402| [47] [Wataru]
107: 1405| [45] ["Hmm, well... they give all sorts of reasons, but to be honest..."]
108: 1431| [47] [Wataru]
109: 1434| [45] ["I think it's because they're basically scared of those people."]
110: 1442| [47] [Watase]
111: 1445| [45] ["Scared? Why?"]
112: 1471| [47] [Wataru]
113: 1474| [45] ["Because a whole lot of Communicators... people who can use BC, that is... have been coming to this city."]
114: 1482| [47] [Wataru]
115: 1485| [45] ["And the city's conducting research these people really don't understand."]
116: 1493| [47] [Watase]
117: 1496| [45] ["But why's it such a big deal for them?"]
118: 1522| [47] [Wataru]
119: 1525| [45] ["Well, the thing is, there've been these BC-related incidents happening from time to time in other countries."]
120: 1533| [47] [Wataru]
121: 1536| [45] ["For example, there've been cases of people in England and France burning down Communicators' homes... horrible incidents like that."]
122: 1544| [47] [Watase]
123: 1547| [45] ["... You shitting me?"]
124: 1555| [47] [Watase]
125: 1558| [45] ["So ordinary people afraid of psychics attack the psychics themselves... Sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel."]
126: 1584| [47] [Wataru]
127: 1587| [45] ["It's already the 21st century... Hard to believe that kind of stuff is happening for real."]
128: 1592| [45] [But when he thought about it carefully--]
129: 1597| [45] [Watase found that he understood why people would be so afraid of mind readers.]
130: 1602| [45] [In more religious countries, those espers could perhaps even be seen as servants of the Devil.]
131: 1610| [47] [Watase]
132: 1613| [45] ["... Scared, huh..."]
133: 1618| [45] [And it also sounded like Rokumei City and the PRC were gathering those Communicators for their research.]
134: 1623| [45] [All while barely explaining a thing to the townspeople, including Watase--]
135: 1631| [47] [Watase]
136: 1634| [45] ["... Well, I guess I can kinda see where that citizen group's coming from."]
137: 1695| [47] [Wataru]
138: 1698| [45] ["Huh!? Hold on, you serious?"]
139: 1706| [47] [Watase]
140: 1709| [45] ["Well, yeah. I mean, don't you feel uncomfortable about guys who can read your mind being all around the city?"]
141: 1717| [47] [Watase]
142: 1720| [45] ["Your privacy will go straight to hell, and you can forget about having any perverted fantasies."]
143: 1746| [47] [Wataru]
144: 1749| [45] ["Oh? So you have perverted fantasies, huh?"]
145: 1757| [47] [Watase]
146: 1760| [45] ["No, I don't. Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is that they don't have to do that kind of research in our city."]
147: 1768| [47] [Watase]
148: 1771| [45] ["I don't really care if espers actually exist or not, but I'd prefer it if they all gathered in any city other than Rokumei."]
149: 1776| [45] [Wataru did not look pleased at all by what Watase was saying.]
150: 1802| [47] [Wataru]
151: 1805| [45] ["... I'm surprised. I never thought you were so narrow-minded."]
152: 1813| [47] [Wataru]
153: 1816| [45] ["When it comes down to it, Communicators are just ordinary people like us, aren't they? So there's no real harm in them gathering here."]
154: 1842| [47] [Wataru]
155: 1845| [45] ["Rokumei City's a calm and peaceful city, so if Communicators who were persecuted in their home countries could gather here, then--"]
156: 1853| [47] [Watase]
157: 1856| [45] ["No, see, that's my point."]
158: 1864| [47] [Watase]
159: 1867| [45] ["It's -because- Rokumei's such a peaceful city that having these potentially problematic guys come here is an issue."]
160: 1893| [47] [Wataru]
161: 1896| [45] ["Geez, Watase, quit overthinking all this! You coward!"]
162: 1910| [45] [Wataru said that and turned away in a huff.]
163: 1915| [47] [Watase]
164: 1916| [45] [(Aaand here comes the sulking.)]
165: 1924| [47] [Watase]
166: 1927| [45] ["... What's gotten into you? Why're you siding with the Communicators so much?"]
167: 1953| [47] [Wataru]
168: 1956| [45] ["'Cause I feel bad for them. Don't you? I mean, it's not like they chose to be born as Communicators."]
169: 1964| [47] [Wataru]
170: 1967| [45] ["Yet they all get picked on just because they're different from ordinary people... That just makes me want to protect them."]
171: 1976| [47] [Watase]
172: 1979| [45] ["And here we go. Your savior complex is rearing its head again. They call that the Florence Nightingale complex."]
173: 2005| [47] [Wataru]
174: 2008| [45] ["... So? Something wrong with that? That's just the way I am."]
175: 2016| [47] [Wataru]
176: 2019| [45] ["I mean, that's also basically why I want to be a rescue worker--"]
177: 2027| [47] [Watase]
178: 2030| [45] ["No, not saying anything's wrong with it, but in that case, why do you want to be a rescue worker?"]
179: 2038| [47] [Watase]
180: 2041| [45] ["Wouldn't you be better suited as a nurse or something?"]
181: 2046| [45] [The twins felt very comfortable with each other, so Watase had no problem bluntly speaking his mind to Wataru.]
182: 2051| [45] [They always had these kinds of conversations, so Wataru answered him without sounding hurt in the slightest.]
183: 2077| [47] [Wataru]
184: 2080| [45] ["Well, even I think this is rather simplistic... but there's something I wanna be."]
185: 2088| [47] [Watase]
186: 2091| [45] ["I know, a rescue worker, right?"]
187: 2117| [47] [Wataru]
188: 2120| [45] ["No, how do I put it... actually, I wanna be a 'hero of justice'."]
189: 2128| [47] [Watase]
190: 2131| [45] ["A-a hero of justice?"]
191: 2136| [45] [Watase stared at Wataru in wonder from her sudden confession.]
192: 2144| [47] [Watase]
193: 2147| [45] ["Are rescue workers... really heroes of justice?"]
194: 2173| [47] [Wataru]
195: 2176| [45] ["Well, this isn't really related to that group, but..."]
196: 2184| [47] [Wataru]
197: 2187| [45] ["There are all different kinds of justice in the world, aren't there?"]
198: 2195| [47] [Watase]
199: 2198| [45] ["Whoa, where'd all this come from?"]
200: 2224| [47] [Wataru]
201: 2227| [45] ["Just hear me out. Anyway, that group considers 'taking action against BC' as justice in their own eyes, right?"]
202: 2235| [47] [Watase]
203: 2238| [45] ["Yeah."]
204: 2264| [47] [Wataru]
205: 2267| [45] ["On the other hand, the people of the PRC probably believe that 'researching BC' is just."]
206: 2275| [47] [Wataru]
207: 2278| [45] ["We all have our own personal sense of justice. Communicator or not."]
208: 2286| [47] [Wataru]
209: 2289| [45] ["When you take everyone's definitions of justice into account and empathize with all those people, you can no longer tell what's just and what's evil."]
210: 2297| [47] [Watase]
211: 2300| [45] ["Well... that's because you have a habit of empathizing with others right away. You even cry when you watch movies and whatnot."]
212: 2326| [47] [Wataru]
213: 2329| [45] ["That's right. But no matter what, the act of 'saving people' regardless of their value systems and personal definitions of justice--"]
214: 2355| [47] [Wataru]
215: 2358| [45] ["That's gotta be 'just' any way you look at it, right?"]
216: 2366| [47] [Watase]
217: 2369| [45] ["Yeah, probably."]
218: 2377| [47] [Wataru]
219: 2380| [45] ["Saving someone's life means protecting their future."]
220: 2388| [47] [Wataru]
221: 2391| [45] ["I just find that to be so incredibly noble... which is why I want to be a rescue worker."]
222: 2417| [47] [Wataru]
223: 2420| [45] ["Well, it's just an idea. I guess I could be a firefighter or a nurse if all that matters is me having a job that involves saving lives..."]
224: 2425| [45] [Watase watched his sister bashfully speak before he muttered in approval.]
225: 2433| [47] [Watase]
226: 2436| [45] ["I see... Yeah, I get where you're coming from."]
227: 2462| [47] [Wataru]
228: 2465| [45] ["So you understand?"]
229: 2473| [47] [Watase]
230: 2476| [45] ["Yeah, I think it's admirable. But there's just one thing bugging me--"]
231: 2484| [47] [Watase]
232: 2487| [45] ["Did it have to be a rescue worker of all things?"]
233: 2495| [47] [Watase]
234: 2498| [45] ["Hate to say it, but you've got horrible stamina and your reflexes suck."]
235: 2524| [47] [Wataru]
236: 2527| [45] ["Ugh..."]
237: 2535| [47] [Watase]
238: 2538| [45] ["If you ever became a rescue worker, you'd be more likely to die before you could save anyone."]
239: 2564| [47] [Wataru]
240: 2567| [45] ["W-well, maybe... but I make up for what I lack in strength with passion and spirit."]
241: 2593| [47] [Wataru]
242: 2596| [45] ["I bet even a total dunce like me could do something if I just work myself to the bone and keep running forward."]
243: 2604| [47] [Watase]
244: 2607| [45] ["'Work myself to the bone'... Wataru, you..."]
245: 2615| [47] [Wataru]
246: 2618| [45] ["It's the feeling that counts. The feeling that my own life means nothing if it can be used to protect other lives--"]
247: 2645| [47] [Watase]
248: 2648| [45] ["Hey, hold on, Wataru."]
249: 2653| [45] [Watase interrupted his sister with a bit of force in his voice.]
250: 2661| [47] [Watase]
251: 2664| [45] ["Quit saying stupid shit like 'my own life means nothing'."]
252: 2672| [47] [Watase]
253: 2675| [45] ["Our old man and lady would cry if they ever heard that."]
254: 2736| [47] [Wataru]
255: 2739| [45] ["..."]
256: 2744| [45] [Wataru gasped at the suddenly serious tone and speech her brother had adopted.]
257: 2770| [47] [Wataru]
258: 2773| [45] ["Y-you're right... I'd really hate to make Mom sad in particular..."]
259: 2781| [47] [Watase]
260: 2784| [45] ["Well of course."]
261: 2789| [45] [--Watase and Wataru were fraternal twins, but they'd heard that their delivery had been quite the difficult one, naturally.]
262: 2794| [45] [So much so that their mother's life had been in danger for a little while.]
263: 2799| [45] [It was for that reason that their parents showered them with love once they'd been safely born.]
264: 2804| [45] [Thus it was only natural that Watase got angry about Wataru talking about her own life like it was nothing.]
265: 2830| [47] [Wataru]
266: 2833| [45] ["O-okay. I'll stop talking about my life so lightly."]
267: 2841| [47] [Watase]
268: 2844| [45] ["Yeah, that's better."]
269: 2870| [47] [Wataru]
270: 2873| [45] ["But I won't give up on my dream of working to protect lives."]
271: 2881| [47] [Wataru]
272: 2884| [45] ["At any rate, if your life was ever in grave danger, I'd save you in a heartbeat even if it cost me my life."]
273: 2892| [47] [Watase]
274: 2895| [45] ["Wha..."]
275: 2903| [47] [Watase]
276: 2906| [45] ["Weren't you listening to what I just said? The old lady would cry if she ever--"]
277: 2932| [47] [Wataru]
278: 2935| [45] ["We were both born from her, so there's nothing wrong with at least protecting each other, is there?"]
279: 2943| [47] [Wataru]
280: 2946| [45] ["And besides, I -am- your big sis, remember?"]
281: 2951| [45] [Watase just shook his head in exasperation when he saw Wataru's beaming smile.]
282: 2959| [47] [Watase]
283: 2962| [45] ["Well... I just hope that day never comes."]
284: 2988| [47] [Wataru]
285: 2991| [45] ["Yeah, knock on wood."]
286: 2996| [45] [The twins smiled at each other.]
287: 3004| [47] [Watase]
288: 3007| [45] ["... Okay, I think we've cooled down 100 percent. Shall we continue running?"]
289: 3015| [47] [Wataru]
290: 3018| [45] ["Sure, race you back home. Sound good?"]
291: 3044| [47] [Wataru]
292: 3047| [45] ["The loser has to treat the winner to ice cream."]
293: 3055| [47] [Watase]
294: 3058| [45] ["Quit while you're ahead. You'll never keep up that bet."]
295: 3078| [45] [They said that and started running back towards their home.]
296: 3213| [45] [The apartment they lived in came into view after they'd run for about 2 km.]
297: 3218| [45] [Watase and Wataru had been keeping up side by side, but--]
298: 3253| [47] [Wataru]
299: 3256| [45] ["I'll be going on ahead now!"]
300: 3261| [45] [Wataru suddenly dashed ahead as she said that.]
301: 3287| [47] [Wataru]
302: 3290| [45] ["You got too cocky, Watase! That ice cream's all mine!"]
303: 3307| [47] [Watase]
304: 3310| [45] ["Wha!? Hey, no fair!"]
305: 3315| [45] [Watase then sped up in an attempt to catch up to her,]
306: 3323| [45] [but then a car suddenly sped down onto the street from a side road.]
307: 3328| [47] [Watase]
308: 3329| [45] [(!?)]
309: 3352| [45] [Wataru froze in shock.]
310: 3363| [45] [The driver slammed the brakes, but the car kept skidding towards Wataru without stopping--!]
311: 3368| [47] [Watase]
312: 3369| [45] [(That thing's gonna run her over!)]
313: 3374| [45] [Watase's body sprung into action the moment that thought crossed his mind.]
314: 3382| [47] [Watase]
315: 3385| [45] ["Wataru!!"]
316: 3470| [47] [Wataru]
317: 3473| [45] ["Aghh!!"]
318: 3478| [45] [Watase dashed towards Wataru with the force of a speeding bullet and pushed her aside.]
319: 3523| [45] [A second later, he felt an impact run near his thighs.]
320: 3528| [47] [Watase]
321: 3529| [45] [(!!)]
322: 3534| [45] [Watase was sent flying by the car, and soon crashed into the pavement.]
323: 3602| [47] [Watase]
324: 3605| [45] ["Ghh... ugh."]
325: 3610| [45] [Watase groaned as he laid face-up in the street.]
326: 3615| [45] [His line of sight was completely filled with the beautiful orange sky.]
327: 3623| [47] [Wataru]
328: 3626| [45] ["Wa... WATASE!!"]
329: 3631| [45] [He heard Wataru crying out to him from somewhere.]
330: 3636| [45] [He then heard a car door opening, followed by the voice of man who was apparently the driver.]
331: 3641| [47] [Driver]
332: 3644| [45] ["Ah, aah, t-t-this is bad...!"]
333: 3652| [47] [Wataru]
334: 3655| [45] ["C-call an ambulance! Watase's... Watase's gonna die!!"]
335: 3660| [45] [If it'd been under any normal circumstances, Watase would have let out a sigh of exasperation at her cries.]
336: 3665| [47] [Watase]
337: 3666| [45] [(I ain't gonna die... but my leg does hurt like hell.)]
338: 3671| [45] [He didn't feel he was in any danger of dying.]
339: 3676| [45] [But though his leg hadn't hurt all that much at the moment of the impact, it had suddenly started to seethe with intense pain.]
340: 3739| [45] [His mind was growing fuzzy. Perhaps he'd suffered a concussion.]
341: 3747| [47] [Wataru]
342: 3750| [45] ["The ambulance is on its way! So don't die, Watase!!"]
343: 3755| [47] [Watase]
344: 3756| [45] [(Hah... what was all that "I'd save you in a heartbeat even if it cost me my life" BS about?)]
345: 3761| [47] [Watase]
346: 3762| [45] [(I was the one who ended up saving you... Some rescue... that... was...)]
347: 3822| [45] [And as he thought all that--]
348: 3827| [45] [--Watase had already lost consciousness.]
