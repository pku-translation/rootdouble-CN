  1:   65| [45] [Once they had left the staircase behind them, Kazami walked towards a nearby room and began talking.]
  2:  127| [47] [Kazami]
  3:  130| [45] ["This is our makeshift base."]
  4:  156| [47] [Kazami]
  5:  159| [45] ["Whenever you want to enter a room, all you have to do is press this button here and the door will open right up."]
  6:  170| [45] [Kazami pressed a button next to the door, causing it to open up just as she'd said it would.]
  7:  219| [45] [On the other side was a small office about 9 meters long.]
  8:  224| [45] [Various pieces of machinery-- apparently the equipment that Kazami and Jun had brought with them-- were lying in a corner.]
  9:  287| [47] [Kazami]
 10:  290| [45] ["I'll explain the structure of LABO to you first, Captain. Please come over here."]
 11:  298| [47] [Watase]
 12:  301| [45] ["Yeah, much appreciated."]
 13:  306| [45] [Kazami took a pen from the desk and drew a simple map on the back of a piece of paper.]
 14:  407| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  410| [45] ["This round area located in the center is a special advanced experiment area where the supposedly melted down nuclear reactor is located-- it's known as 'Area N'."]
 16:  418| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  421| [45] ["Area N is surrounded by six other areas."]
 18:  429| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  432| [45] ["Each area has an inner ring and an outer ring, with the former being slightly smaller than the latter."]
 20:  458| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  461| [45] ["Furthermore, each area has four floors in total-- two surface floors and two basement floors--"]
 22:  469| [47] [Kazami]
 23:  472| [45] ["However, as I informed you earlier, all the entrances and exits that lead to the surface are blocked by bulkheads."]
 24:  480| [47] [Watase]
 25:  483| [45] ["I see... meaning we can only access floors B1 and B2."]
 26:  491| [47] [Watase]
 27:  494| [45] ["So where are we now?"]
 28:  520| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  523| [45] ["Right here--"]
 30:  586| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  589| [45] ["Floor B2, in Area 2's inner ring."]
 32:  597| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  600| [45] ["We found you lying right around here, in the inner ring of Area 1."]
 34:  681| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  684| [45] ["Moribe and I conducted a search of Areas 1 and 2 in the two hours since the bulkheads came down..."]
 36:  692| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  695| [45] ["But we were unable to find any other survivors apart from you and Ms. Yuuri. And naturally, the same goes for any escape routes."]
 38:  776| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  779| [45] ["Both areas have an emergency staircase that leads to the surface, but we've confirmed that they've all been sealed off by bulkheads."]
 40:  787| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  790| [45] ["And with the exception of one located in Area 2's inner ring, all of the staircases have collapsed due to the explosions."]
 42:  853| [47] [Watase]
 43:  856| [45] ["... So what you're saying is that we'll have to go to Area 3 next if we hope to possibly find any more survivors or other ways out of here."]
 44:  882| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  885| [45] ["No, we can't do that either."]
 46:  893| [47] [Watase]
 47:  896| [45] ["Why not?"]
 48:  904| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  907| [45] ["All passageways connecting to other areas have 'security gates' set up in them."]
 50:  915| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  918| [45] ["Remember how there was a gate blocking the connecting passageway to this area on our way here?"]
 52: 1004| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1007| [45] ["Now that you mention it, yeah, I do..."]
 54: 1015| [47] [Kazami]
 55: 1018| [45] ["Those gates are locked, and to open them, you'll need a 'security card' like this one."]
 56: 1029| [45] [Kazami took a card out of her pocket at those words.]
 57: 1055| [47] [Kazami]
 58: 1058| [45] ["I found this card lying in a passageway by chance shortly after we began searching."]
 59: 1063| [45] [It was a small plastic card that had a lanyard attached to it so it could be worn around the neck.]
 60: 1068| [45] [On the front was the mug shot and name of a man who appeared to work at the facility, and the words "Lv. 2".]
 61: 1076| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1079| [45] ["Level 2...?"]
 63: 1087| [47] [Kazami]
 64: 1090| [45] ["It appears that this lab has different security levels that correspond to each area's confidentiality level."]
 65: 1191| [47] [Kazami]
 66: 1194| [45] ["There are two kinds of gates: ones in the passageways that connect the inner and outer rings, and ones in the passageways that connect each area."]
 67: 1257| [47] [Kazami]
 68: 1260| [45] ["With a Level 2 card, you can open all gates up to Area 2--"]
 69: 1268| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1271| [45] ["But you'll need a card whose security level corresponds to the appropriate area to get into them; a Level 3 card for Area 3, a Level 4 card for Area 4, and so on."]
 71: 1279| [47] [Kazami]
 72: 1282| [45] ["But all we have right now is a Level 2 card."]
 73: 1328| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1331| [45] ["Then we can't go any farther?"]
 75: 1357| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1360| [45] ["Well, if we find the right card, it'll be possible for us to get into other areas, of course, but..."]
 77: 1386| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1389| [45] ["We've searched the place from head to toe and that's the only card we found, y'see."]
 79: 1415| [47] [Jun]
 80: 1418| [45] ["Guess the only place we haven't looked is your pockets."]
 81: 1426| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1429| [45] ["Worth a check..."]
 83: 1434| [45] ["Yeah right, like I'm going to find a Level 3 card just conveniently sitting around in my pockets..."]
 84: 1439| [45] [In spite of that thought, Watase decided to search through his pockets, and--]
 85: 1447| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1450| [45] ["...!?"]
 87: 1458| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1461| [45] ["I... I found one."]
 89: 1502| [47] [Jun]
 90: 1505| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 91: 1513| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1516| [45] ["Impossible!"]
 93: 1524| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1527| [45] ["No, I'm totally serious. Take a look."]
 95: 1613| [45] [Watase took two cards out of his breast pocket.]
 96: 1618| [45] [They read "Keiji Ukita" and "Zenshu Kakei".]
 97: 1623| [45] [And they both said "Lv. 4".]
 98: 1651| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1654| [45] ["Level 4!? Holy crap, now we can get all the way into Area 4 with this baby!"]
100: 1680| [47] [Kazami]
101: 1683| [45] ["But why do you have a Level 4- no, make that -two- Level 4 cards, Captain?"]
102: 1691| [47] [Watase]
103: 1694| [45] ["Beats me..."]
104: 1699| [45] [Thinking there might be more clues in them, Watase checked his other pockets--]
105: 1704| [45] [and found another strange item in his other breast pocket.]
106: 1793| [47] [Watase]
107: 1796| [45] ["What's... this?"]
108: 1823| [47] [Kazami]
109: 1826| [45] ["An official Sirius PDA. I have one as well."]
110: 1834| [47] [Watase]
111: 1837| [45] ["What's a PDA?"]
112: 1863| [47] [Jun]
113: 1866| [45] ["A portable terminal. Nowadays, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone who -doesn't- have one of these, rescue workers and civilians alike."]
114: 1929| [47] [Kazami]
115: 1932| [45] ["As for its functions, it has a built in phone and radio, plus an 'infrared thermography', or IRT, function that allows you to detect heat sources."]
116: 1965| [47] [Watase]
117: 1968| [45] ["How do you use it?"]
118: 1994| [47] [Kazami]
119: 1997| [45] ["It's a touchpad, so all you have to do is press this part of the screen here..."]
120: 2002| [45] [Watase tried tapping the screen as he listened to Kazami's instructions.]
121: 2047| [45] [When he did, the screen filled with the primary colors: red, blue, and yellow.]
122: 2055| [47] [Watase]
123: 2058| [45] ["So that means anything that's red is carrying heat?"]
124: 2084| [47] [Kazami]
125: 2087| [45] ["It may be simple, but it can be very handy in the right situation."]
126: 2095| [47] [Watase]
127: 2098| [45] ["I see..."]
128: 2202| [47] [Jun]
129: 2205| [45] ["And you can carry around data with that thing too, of course... oh yeah, is there any data in yours?"]
130: 2213| [47] [Watase]
131: 2216| [45] ["Let me check."]
132: 2221| [45] [Watase tried just pressing anything that looked potentially helpful.]
133: 2226| [45] [But it didn't look like he'd be able to access any of the data folders. They were all locked with a password.]
134: 2259| [47] [Watase]
135: 2262| [45] ["It needs a password... Any idea what it might be?"]
136: 2288| [47] [Kazami]
137: 2291| [45] ["That's a negative, obviously."]
138: 2317| [47] [Jun]
139: 2320| [45] ["Oh, by the way, the phone doesn't work down here, and the radio's pretty much useless right now."]
140: 2328| [47] [Watase]
141: 2331| [45] ["Yeah, I remember you telling me that before..."]
142: 2336| [45] [Despite that, Watase decided to try and use the phone function.]
143: 2341| [45] [He first attempted to call "Dojima", the co-worker that Kazami had mentioned earlier--]
144: 2346| [45] [--But all he heard was the sound of a dead dial tone.]
145: 2351| [45] [He next tried to use the radio function to contact "Hiyama", his other co-worker.]
146: 2356| [45] [But all he heard this time was static.]
147: 2361| [45] [It was the same with every other number and frequency he tried to contact.]
148: 2369| [47] [Watase]
149: 2372| [45] ["... Dammit, this piece of junk's worth crap right now."]
150: 2380| [47] [Watase]
151: 2383| [45] ["If I could only figure out the password, then I might be able to find some clues..."]
152: 2409| [47] [Jun]
153: 2412| [45] ["Why don't you try typing in whatever comes to mind?"]
154: 2435| [45] [It was right then that Yuuri timidly spoke up.]
155: 2443| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 2446| [45] ["Um... I don't think that's a good idea..."]
157: 2454| [47] [Watase]
158: 2457| [45] ["Huh?"]
159: 2483| [47] [Jun]
160: 2486| [45] ["Why not?"]
161: 2512| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 2515| [45] ["U-um..."]
163: 2541| [47] [Yuuri]
164: 2544| [45] ["That PDA's important to you, so... you'd be in a lot of trouble if you broke it by accident..."]
165: 2552| [47] [Watase]
166: 2555| [45] ["Y-yeah, good point..."]
167: 2560| [45] [Watase put the PDA away.]
168: 2568| [47] [Watase]
169: 2571| [45] ["By the way, guys, what's all that gear you brought here do?"]
170: 2597| [47] [Jun]
171: 2600| [45] ["Ah, you forgot that too, huh? Well, time's short, so I'll have to give you an abridged explanation."]
172: 2608| [47] [Watase]
173: 2611| [45] ["Thanks, sorry to make you do this."]
174: 2686| [45] [Jun nodded and pointed to the equipment lying in the corner.]
175: 2787| [47] [Jun]
176: 2790| [45] ["First off, this is 'AD'. Pretty sure you're familiar with it by now."]
177: 2798| [47] [Jun]
178: 2801| [45] ["Just to recap, it's a drug that protects your body from radiation for an hour."]
179: 2809| [47] [Watase]
180: 2812| [45] ["So this is all that's keeping us alive now, huh..."]
181: 2838| [47] [Jun]
182: 2841| [45] ["Yep. With the ones they gave us and what we found lying around, we've got a total of seven doses."]
183: 2849| [47] [Watase]
184: 2852| [45] ["Hmm? What exactly do you mean by 'the ones we found lying around'?"]
185: 2878| [47] [Jun]
186: 2881| [45] ["Seems that there's a bunch of boxes full of AD in this place that were stashed away in case of an emergency."]
187: 2907| [47] [Jun]
188: 2910| [45] ["Unfortunately, looks like most of the stockpile in Areas 1 and 2 went up in flames."]
189: 2918| [47] [Watase]
190: 2921| [45] ["So there's seven ampules for the four of us... which means that we'll only last for two more hours at this rate?"]
191: 2947| [47] [Jun]
192: 2950| [45] ["It'd sure make things easier if we found more, wouldn't it? So we'll keep our eyes peeled for more as we go."]
193: 3013| [47] [Jun]
194: 3016| [45] ["Next up is 'Procyon', our radiation counter."]
195: 3024| [47] [Jun]
196: 3027| [45] ["It's basically the latest model of Geiger counters. This little sucker can measure and quantify radiation levels up to 15,000 msV."]
197: 3035| [47] [Jun]
198: 3038| [45] ["The Procyon and AD were given to use by LABO's staff. They've both been a real big help, to say the least."]
199: 3043| [47] [Watase]
200: 3044| [45] [(Yeah, they really are handy... it's almost like the staff gave them to us knowing what was to come.)]
201: 3070| [47] [Jun]
202: 3073| [45] ["Hey, quit staring off into space. I'm moving on to the next item."]
203: 3155| [47] [Jun]
204: 3158| [45] ["This thing's an 'air tank'- standard equipment for our squad."]
205: 3184| [47] [Jun]
206: 3187| [45] ["But all our faceplates are damaged, so it's not much good to us now."]
207: 3195| [47] [Watase]
208: 3198| [45] ["I see... That's too bad, it looked really important too."]
209: 3280| [47] [Jun]
210: 3283| [45] ["This is an 'air jack'."]
211: 3291| [47] [Jun]
212: 3294| [45] ["It's a powerful jack that you combine with an air tank to create compressed air that you can use to move heavy objects."]
213: 3302| [47] [Watase]
214: 3305| [45] ["So you use it with the air tank? I mean, I'm guessing you can only use it a limited amount of times, but still."]
215: 3313| [47] [Jun]
216: 3316| [45] ["With the faceplates damaged, that's the -only- use it has."]
217: 3399| [47] [Jun]
218: 3402| [45] ["Now then, next we have the 'engine cutter'!"]
219: 3410| [47] [Jun]
220: 3413| [45] ["Its electric engine is powered by a strong internal battery! This baby and her artificial diamond blade can slice through iron and pretty anything else like it was butter!"]
221: 3421| [47] [Watase]
222: 3424| [45] ["... Could you not get so... excited about it? That look in your eyes is scaring me."]
223: 3450| [47] [Jun]
224: 3453| [45] ["Eheh, I get that a lot."]
225: 3534| [47] [Jun]
226: 3537| [45] ["And last but not least, have a '10 m long rope'... I think that's everything. Can you remember all that, Captain?"]
227: 3556| [47] [Watase]
228: 3559| [45] ["Yeah, no prob."]
229: 3603| [47] [Kazami]
230: 3606| [45] ["Incidentally, we also had two 'radiation protection suits'..."]
231: 3614| [47] [Kazami]
232: 3617| [45] ["But they got damaged while we were putting out fires, so we can't use them anymore."]
233: 3622| [45] [Kazami pointed to two ragged objects.]
234: 3627| [45] [Both protection suits had cracked faceplates.]
235: 3653| [47] [Kazami]
236: 3656| [45] ["They were fine pieces of equipment with excellent fire and water resistance, airtight, and even allowed you to connect an air tank directly to their facepieces--"]
237: 3664| [47] [Kazami]
238: 3667| [45] ["But since they're damaged now, the air tank's no longer useful."]
239: 3675| [47] [Watase]
240: 3678| [45] ["That's too bad...!"]
241: 3704| [47] [Jun]
242: 3707| [45] ["But wait a sec... Captain, weren't you wearing a protective suit too? What happened to it?"]
243: 3715| [47] [Watase]
244: 3718| [45] ["Huh? Hmm... maybe I took it off because it was hard to move in or something?"]
245: 3744| [47] [Kazami]
246: 3747| [45] ["Impossible! We were all required to wear the protective suits to carry out our rescue activities in this facility from the start."]
247: 3755| [47] [Watase]
248: 3758| [45] ["I-I see... But sorry, I don't know why. That's another thing you can chalk up to my amnesia."]
249: 3763| [45] [Not only had he had two security cards on him, but he also hadn't been wearing his protective suit-- there were just too many mysteries about Watase's actions before he lost his memories.]
250: 3768| [47] [Watase]
251: 3769| [45] [(Seriously... what in the world was I -doing- in the basement floors?)]
252: 3774| [45] [There was probably no one out there who could answer that question. Watase then spoke with a sigh.]
253: 3782| [47] [Watase]
254: 3785| [45] ["By the way... what're you guys planning to do now?"]
255: 3811| [47] [Kazami]
256: 3814| [45] ["Well, now that we have Level 4 cards, I believe that we should be able to greatly expand our search area. However..."]
257: 3840| [47] [Jun]
258: 3843| [45] ["What about you, Captain? Maybe it'd be better for you to rest?"]
259: 3869| [47] [Kazami]
260: 3872| [45] ["Seeing as how you haven't remembered anything yet, I'm inclined to agree."]
261: 3880| [47] [Watase]
262: 3883| [45] ["Yeah, maybe you're right..."]
263: 3888| [45] [Just as Watase was about to take them up on their offer--]
264: 3965| [45] [He locked eyes with Yuuri.]
265: 3973| [47] [Watase]
266: 3976| [45] ["!"]
267: 4002| [47] [Yuuri]
268: 4005| [45] ["...?"]
269: 4010| [45] [She still had fear in her eyes.]
270: 4015| [45] [He remembered the voice that he'd heard back when they'd rescued her.]
271: 4118| [85] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
272: 4119| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
273: 4120| [86] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
274: 4157| [45] [--He suddenly began wondering if it was really okay for him to just sit around in this room.]
275: 4162| [47] [Watase]
276: 4163| [45] [(Is saving Yuuri and simply leaving it at that all right?)]
277: 4168| [47] [Watase]
278: 4169| [45] [(No...!)]
279: 4174| [45] [With his mind made up, Watase called out to Kazami and Jun.]
280: 4239| [47] [Watase]
281: 4242| [45] ["W-wait...! Let me help out with rescuing any other survivors!"]
282: 4268| [47] [Kazami]
283: 4271| [45] ["Huh? But--"]
284: 4297| [47] [Jun]
285: 4300| [45] ["You sure you'll be okay, Captain?"]
286: 4308| [47] [Watase]
287: 4311| [45] ["It's true that I don't remember all that much and that I might just be a burden in your eyes..."]
288: 4319| [47] [Watase]
289: 4322| [45] ["But that doesn't change that I'm still a rescue worker, right? So I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I just sat on the sidelines while you're all still hard at work."]
290: 4327| [45] [Watase was stirred on by an almost impulsive sense of duty.]
291: 4332| [45] [Kazami's eyes widened. She then gave a wry smile.]
292: 4358| [47] [Kazami]
293: 4361| [45] ["... Sheesh, some things just never change..."]
294: 4369| [47] [Watase]
295: 4372| [45] ["...?"]
296: 4377| [45] [Her face then suddenly grew serious again.]
297: 4403| [47] [Kazami]
298: 4406| [45] ["... Captain. Normally, I would not recommend that you come with us, what with the cause of your amnesia still unknown."]
299: 4414| [47] [Kazami]
300: 4417| [45] ["But taking into consideration the fact that there are still fires out there and that we need to keep injecting you with AD..."]
301: 4425| [47] [Kazami]
302: 4428| [45] ["Perhaps letting you come with us would be the safest course of action."]
303: 4436| [47] [Watase]
304: 4439| [45] ["All right! Then--"]
305: 4511| [47] [Kazami]
306: 4514| [45] ["However!"]
307: 4522| [47] [Kazami]
308: 4525| [45] ["This is no ordinary mission. So if you want to stay with us as a rescue worker, then you must be prepared to accept the responsibilities and duties that come with it."]
309: 4533| [47] [Watase]
310: 4536| [45] ["...!"]
311: 4562| [47] [Kazami]
312: 4565| [45] ["You will be treated as a new recruit until you regain your memory. I ask that you follow my orders just as Moribe does."]
313: 4573| [47] [Kazami]
314: 4576| [45] ["I know this is a severe violation of my station, but trust me when I say your life could be in grave danger if you don't do as I say... Please try to understand."]
315: 4591| [45] [Watase felt overpowered by Kazami's words--]
316: 4599| [47] [Watase]
317: 4602| [45] ["Y... yeah, roger that!"]
318: 4607| [45] [But he fired himself up by answering loud and clear.]
319: 4612| [45] [Jun shrugged her shoulders when she saw that.]
320: 4638| [47] [Jun]
321: 4641| [45] ["Wow, this sure is an interesting turn of events, huh?"]
322: 4649| [47] [Jun]
323: 4652| [45] ["Then I guess that makes us equals for now, even if it's just temporary, so let's get along, okay?"]
324: 4660| [47] [Watase]
325: 4663| [45] ["Y-you're right. I'm looking forward to working with you too."]
326: 4689| [47] [Kazami]
327: 4692| [45] ["Then let's be patient for the time being... after all, once you get your memories back, you should go back to being the Captain we all know and admire."]
328: 4718| [47] [Jun]
329: 4721| [45] ["Yeah, that's something we're looking forward to."]
330: 4733| [47] [Watase]
331: 4736| [45] ["...!"]
332: 4741| [45] [He felt overwhelmed by the words "your life could be in grave danger".]
333: 4746| [45] [He instinctively turned away from Kazami and looked at Jun.]
334: 4772| [47] [Jun]
335: 4775| [45] ["... You know Captain, you can still back out if you're scared."]
336: 4783| [47] [Jun]
337: 4786| [45] ["This mission is the craziest I've seen. There's no guarantee you'll survive even with a body as well-trained as yours."]
338: 4812| [47] [Jun]
339: 4815| [45] ["So you don't have to feel embarrassed or anything about resting here."]
340: 4820| [45] [However, Jun's considerate words only served to give Watase the encouragement he needed.]
341: 4828| [47] [Watase]
342: 4831| [45] ["No, I can do this!"]
343: 4857| [47] [Jun]
344: 4860| [45] ["... Yep, that's the spirit. You sound like you'll be okay."]
345: 4886| [47] [Jun]
346: 4889| [45] ["Then I guess that makes us equals for now, even if it's just temporary, so let's get along, okay?"]
347: 4897| [47] [Watase]
348: 4900| [45] ["Y-yeah. I hope I can keep up with you both."]
349: 4926| [47] [Jun]
350: 4929| [45] ["C'mon, don't be so hard on yourself! Trust me, once you get your memories back, you'll be back to the Captain we all know and admire!"]
351: 4955| [47] [Kazami]
352: 4958| [45] ["She's right. That's something we're both looking forward to."]
353: 4967| [45] [Watase felt overpowered by Kazami's words--]
354: 4975| [47] [Watase]
355: 4978| [45] ["G... got it."]
356: 4983| [45] [And only barely managed to wring out this answer.]
357: 5009| [47] [Jun]
358: 5012| [45] ["You don't really sound confident, but... you should be fine."]
359: 5038| [47] [Jun]
360: 5041| [45] ["Then I guess that makes us equals for now, even if it's just temporary, so let's get along, okay?"]
361: 5049| [47] [Watase]
362: 5052| [45] ["Y-you're right. I hope I can be of help."]
363: 5078| [47] [Jun]
364: 5081| [45] ["C'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. I mean, hey, once you get your memories back, you'll be back to being the Captain we all know and admire."]
365: 5107| [47] [Kazami]
366: 5110| [45] ["She's right. That's something we're both looking forward to."]
367: 5118| [47] [Watase]
368: 5121| [45] ["Mmm, I see..."]
369: 5126| [45] [His old self must have been someone amazing if Kazami and Jun were counting on him so much.]
370: 5131| [47] [Watase]
371: 5132| [45] [(So I have to live up to their expectations as soon as possible...!)]
372: 5137| [45] [With that thought in mind, Watase turned to Yuuri.]
373: 5145| [47] [Watase]
374: 5148| [45] ["What about you, Yuuri? Do you want to rest here?"]
375: 5153| [45] [A look of hesitation briefly flashed by Yuuri's face after she heard that question... but she answered quickly.]
376: 5179| [47] [Yuuri]
377: 5182| [45] ["N-no... I'll... go with you..."]
378: 5187| [45] [She'd probably realized just how grim the situation was after listening to the group's conversation.]
379: 5192| [47] [Watase]
380: 5193| [45] [(I'd feel better if she were with us too...)]
381: 5198| [45] [Kazami spoke up as that thought crossed Watase's mind.]
382: 5224| [47] [Kazami]
383: 5227| [45] ["Then it's settled: the four of us will head for Area 3 next."]
384: 5253| [47] [Jun]
385: 5256| [45] ["Then let's decide what equipment to take with us! You help out too, Captain!"]
386: 5264| [47] [Watase]
387: 5267| [45] ["Y-yeah, on it!"]
388: 5310| [45] [--And so the group quickly decided on their gear.]
389: 5315| [45] [First, they took all seven AD, splitting them up amongst Watase, Kazami, and Jun.]
390: 5320| [45] [Watase and Jun each took one Procyon.]
391: 5325| [45] [Meanwhile, Watase and Kazami split the Level 4 cards amongst themselves.]
392: 5330| [45] [Watase also took the 10 m rope, wrapping it around his upper body in an "X" shape.]
393: 5335| [45] [Perhaps they were too lightly equipped, but they'd decided that mobility took precedence above all else.]
394: 5397| [47] [Kazami]
395: 5400| [45] ["--Is everyone ready?"]
396: 5408| [47] [Watase]
397: 5411| [45] ["Whenever you are."]
398: 5465| [47] [Yuuri]
399: 5468| [45] ["... Yes."]
400: 5522| [47] [Jun]
401: 5525| [45] ["Then let's go! Don't slow us down, Captain!"]
402: 5533| [47] [Watase]
403: 5536| [45] ["Roger that! I'll give it all I've got!"]
404: 5579| [45] ["I don't know what I can do in my condition, but I'll still do my best--"]
405: 5584| [45] [Watase swore to that, then left the makeshift base alongside Kazami and the others.]
