  0:  102| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 2]
  1:  109| [47] [Watase]
  2:  112| [45] ["Wh-what's that noise!?"]
  3:  145| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  148| [45] ["Oh, that's my watch alarm. I set it to go off when our last dosage of AD wears off."]
  5:  153| [45] [Taken aback, Watase checked his watch.]
  6:  158| [45] [The digital reading said "10:16 AM" on it.]
  7:  166| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  169| [45] ["I know there are some of you here who took their last AD less than an hour ago, but we should all inject ourselves now just to be safe."]
  9:  195| [47] [Ukita]
 10:  198| [45] ["I-I see... then let's put this discussion aside for now and administer it to everyone."]
 11:  224| [47] [Jun]
 12:  227| [45] ["Yeah... these are our lives that are at stake here, after all."]
 13:  310| [45] [Jun seemed to have come back to her senses, as she quickly distributed AD to Ena, Ukita, and Yuuri.]
 14:  315| [45] [Ena and Ukita injected themselves immediately.]
 15:  348| [47] [Ena]
 16:  351| [45] ["... This'll keep us up and running for another hour, huh?"]
 17:  378| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  381| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 19:  386| [45] [Ena and Ukita muttered that.]
 20:  462| [45] [But-- Yuuri and Yuuri alone still hadn't injected herself for some reason.]
 21:  489| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  492| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri, what's wrong?"]
 23:  518| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  521| [45] ["No... I-I don't want to inject it..."]
 25:  547| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  550| [45] ["You're still saying things like that!?"]
 27:  558| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  561| [45] ["Very well. Then I'll do it."]
 29:  587| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  590| [45] ["N-no..."]
 31:  616| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  619| [45] ["You can't be stubborn!"]
 33:  652| [47] [Yuuri]
 34:  655| [45] ["Ah..."]
 35:  660| [45] [Just like last time, Kazami injected Yuuri with AD without hearing the latter out.]
 36:  718| [45] [--But there were now only two AD left.]
 37:  723| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Jun exchanged glances.]
 38:  749| [47] [Jun]
 39:  752| [45] ["Dammit, now we're too short...!"]
 40:  760| [47] [Watase]
 41:  763| [45] ["... What should we do?"]
 42:  790| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  793| [45] ["'What should we do'? That's already been decided."]
 44:  801| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  804| [45] ["Captain, Moribe, please administer it to yourselves."]
 46:  830| [47] [Watase]
 47:  833| [45] ["Wh-why us!?"]
 48:  841| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  844| [45] ["Your body still isn't in perfect shape, so there's no way I can allow you to push yourself."]
 50:  870| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  873| [45] ["And Moribe has the smallest body amongst us. So we should assume her resistance to radiation is weak."]
 52:  899| [47] [Jun]
 53:  902| [45] ["B-but what're you gonna do, Lieutenant!?"]
 54:  907| [45] [Once Jun asked this, Kazami held out something to her and Watase.]
 55:  933| [47] [Kazami]
 56:  936| [45] ["I'll use this."]
 57:  941| [45] [--It was the damaged ampule that'd been lying near Dojima's body just minutes ago.]
 58:  946| [45] [Only half of it still remained, the other half having leaked out through the cracks in the container.]
 59:  954| [47] [Watase]
 60:  957| [45] ["N-no way... You're not seriously gonna try keeping your body protected with only half a dose, are you!?"]
 61:  965| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  968| [45] ["What do -you- think, Mr. Ukita?"]
 63:  996| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  999| [45] ["W-well, let me think... if the drug's dosage has been halved, then that means the effects should also be halved..."]
 65: 1025| [47] [Ukita]
 66: 1028| [45] ["Or maybe it'll only be effective for half the time... Honestly, I don't know."]
 67: 1054| [47] [Kazami]
 68: 1057| [45] ["But you -are- saying that it's better than nothing at all, right?"]
 69: 1083| [47] [Ukita]
 70: 1086| [45] ["Well, yes, that's true, but--"]
 71: 1112| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1115| [45] ["W-wait a minute! It's still way too risky!"]
 73: 1120| [45] [Jun showed her Procyon to Kazami.]
 74: 1146| [47] [Jun]
 75: 1149| [45] ["The Procyon's reading is currently at '2035 mSv'! Not only is this level life-threatening as it is, but it's still rising, you know that!?"]
 76: 1157| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1160| [45] ["She's right! If this AD's effects don't properly manifest, then you'll be exposed--"]
 78: 1186| [47] [Kazami]
 79: 1189| [45] ["Then what do you propose we do? The fact remains that we don't have enough AD."]
 80: 1197| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1200| [45] ["I'll be taking the damaged AD no matter what you say."]
 82: 1226| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1229| [45] ["But..."]
 84: 1255| [47] [Kazami]
 85: 1258| [45] ["No backtalk, Moribe!"]
 86: 1365| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1368| [45] ["!"]
 88: 1373| [45] [Kazami's angry shouts echoed through the hallway as if to ward off Jun's pleas.]
 89: 1381| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1384| [45] ["This is an order! You're wasting valuable time complaining about this!"]
 91: 1392| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1395| [45] ["We're all being exposed to radiation right now, at this very second!"]
 93: 1403| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1406| [45] ["If you're worried about me, then please administer the AD right now and continue the search!"]
 95: 1423| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1426| [45] ["...!"]
 97: 1431| [45] [Kazami's face was brimming with determination.]
 98: 1436| [45] [When Watase and Jun saw that, they realized that there was no use in trying to persuade her.]
 99: 1444| [47] [Watase]
100: 1447| [45] ["Moribe... let's do as Tachibana says."]
101: 1473| [47] [Jun]
102: 1476| [45] ["Y-yeah...!"]
103: 1566| [45] [Watase and Jun hurriedly injected themselves with AD.]
104: 1577| [45] [Kazami also injected herself with the damaged AD--]
105: 1582| [45] [She then turned to Ukita and the others and spoke.]
106: 1590| [45] [Though he was overwhelmed by her menacing attitude-- Watase still argued back.]
107: 1598| [47] [Watase]
108: 1601| [45] ["No, wait, I'll inject myself with the half-dose of AD!"]
109: 1609| [47] [Watase]
110: 1612| [45] ["I can't let a woman do something so reckless!"]
111: 1684| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1687| [45] ["Woman!? Did you just call me 'woman'!? Is that why you're trying to be considerate!?"]
113: 1695| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1698| [45] ["Please do not get so conceited! I believe you agreed to obey my orders when we set out, did you not!?"]
115: 1706| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1709| [45] ["Then be silent and do as I say!"]
117: 1714| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase.]
118: 1726| [45] [But he didn't back down.]
119: 1804| [47] [Watase]
120: 1807| [45] ["Just hand it over!"]
121: 1833| [47] [Kazami]
122: 1836| [45] ["Ah!"]
123: 1847| [45] [Watase snatched the damaged AD out of Kazami's hands and injected himself with it.]
124: 1873| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1876| [45] ["Wha... what have you done!?"]
126: 1884| [47] [Watase]
127: 1887| [45] ["I had no choice... talking wasn't going to get us anywhere."]
128: 1892| [45] [Watase gave Kazami the undamaged AD and spoke.]
129: 1900| [47] [Watase]
130: 1903| [45] ["Come on, hurry up and inject yourself with this. You were the one who said time was valuable."]
131: 1929| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1932| [45] ["...!"]
133: 1958| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1961| [45] ["Understood!"]
135: 1973| [45] [Kazami injected herself with the AD as if she'd resigned herself.]
136: 2020| [45] [Jun quickly followed suit.]
137: 2078| [45] [Kazami sighed, then spoke to Ukita and the others.]
138: 2087| [47] [Watase]
139: 2088| [45] [(Khh... so persuading her won't do it!?)]
140: 2093| [45] [It was at that moment that Jun whispered to Watase.]
141: 2119| [47] [Jun]
142: 2122| [45] ["Captain... let's do as the Lieutenant says. You can't overturn the chain of command."]
143: 2130| [47] [Watase]
144: 2133| [45] ["R-right...!"]
145: 2138| [45] [Watase and Jun reluctantly injected themselves with AD.]
146: 2228| [45] [Kazami breathed a relieved sigh and spoke to Ukita and the others.]
147: 2254| [47] [Kazami]
148: 2257| [45] ["... I apologize for causing you trouble. Now we've all finished injecting ourselves, correct?"]
149: 2341| [47] [Ukita]
150: 2344| [45] ["R-right...!"]
151: 2352| [47] [Ena]
152: 2355| [45] ["Y-you're right."]
153: 2360| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2361| [45] ["..."]
155: 2366| [45] [They were most likely still taken aback from seeing the altercation between the rescue workers.]
156: 2371| [45] [Ukita and the others were now quiet, like their fight mere minutes ago had never happened.]
157: 2475| [47] [Kazami]
158: 2478| [45] ["Now then, with that roadblock out of the way... let's talk about our next move."]
159: 2483| [45] [Kazami spoke with a calm voice, betraying none of the anxiety she must have felt from her coworker's death and the lack of AD.]
160: 2509| [47] [Kazami]
161: 2512| [45] ["First of all, we've more or less completed our search of Area 3, with the exception of the B1 outer ring."]
162: 2520| [47] [Kazami]
163: 2523| [45] ["However, we can't get in because the security slot is broken."]
164: 2549| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2552| [45] ["So we were planning on moving on to Area 4 next... but are all you non-rescue personnel all right?"]
166: 2579| [47] [Ukita]
167: 2582| [45] ["D-define 'all right'."]
168: 2608| [47] [Kazami]
169: 2611| [45] ["What I mean is if you feel mentally fit to keep on searching... right after you've seen those corpses."]
170: 2653| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2656| [45] ["...!"]
172: 2661| [45] [Ukita and Yuuri gasped at those words-- but in contrast, Ena replied in a subdued tone.]
173: 2687| [47] [Ena]
174: 2690| [45] ["Of course I'll keep on going."]
175: 2698| [47] [Watase]
176: 2701| [45] ["I see. Then come with us."]
177: 2727| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2730| [45] ["B-but... that killer really could still be lurking around...!"]
179: 2756| [47] [Ena]
180: 2759| [45] ["You're still on about that, Mr. Ukita!?"]
181: 2785| [47] [Ena]
182: 2788| [45] ["I get that you think it's too dangerous to move around, but if you want to stay here, then you're on your own."]
183: 2814| [47] [Ena]
184: 2817| [45] ["But if you -don't- move, you just might be waiting for death, right?"]
185: 2843| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2846| [45] ["..."]
187: 2854| [47] [Watase]
188: 2857| [45] ["She's right. And besides, we have no AD right now... to be honest, it'd be better to have an extra helping hand with the search."]
189: 2885| [47] [Ena]
190: 2888| [45] [".... There's also Lieutenant Tachibana's health to consider as well. We should help with the search to ensure we can get some AD as well."]
191: 2897| [47] [Ena]
192: 2900| [45] [".... There's also Captain Kasasagi's health to consider as well. We should help with the search to ensure we can get some AD as well."]
193: 2926| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2929| [45] ["Y-you make good points..."]
195: 2934| [45] [Ukita reluctantly nodded. It seemed even he with all his stubbornness had realized how harsh the situation was.]
196: 3053| [47] [Jun]
197: 3056| [45] ["What do you want to do, Yuuri...?"]
198: 3061| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 3062| [45] ["..."]
200: 3088| [47] [Yuuri]
201: 3091| [45] ["... I-I'll come along with you guys."]
202: 3119| [47] [Kazami]
203: 3122| [45] ["Yes, it would be much safer that way. Having everyone within eyesight would be best."]
204: 3127| [45] [Kazami then turned her head.]
205: 3132| [45] [She was looking at the Area 4 connecting passageway.]
206: 3140| [47] [Kazami]
207: 3143| [45] ["Then let's head over to the next area. Fortunately, it appears that security terminal is still intact."]
208: 3151| [47] [Watase]
209: 3154| [45] ["... Yeah."]
210: 3159| [45] [And with that low voice, the group started walking off again.]
