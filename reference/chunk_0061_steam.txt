  1:   55| [45] [--The team finished up their search of B2 not three minutes later.]
  2:   60| [45] [But it had turned up fruitless, as always.]
  3:  122| [47] [Ena]
  4:  125| [45] ["... Shall we head up to B1 next?"]
  5:  133| [47] [Watase]
  6:  136| [45] ["Yeah, but-- the emergency staircase in this block has collapsed."]
  7:  163| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  166| [45] ["What? Then how did you search it last time?"]
  9:  174| [47] [Watase]
 10:  177| [45] ["We climbed up a rope instead of the stairs."]
 11:  185| [47] [Watase]
 12:  188| [45] ["But it might be too hard for you guys to climb it..."]
 13:  193| [45] [He could carry one of them on his back, but it would take far too much time with two or for them to climb the rope individually.]
 14:  219| [47] [Ena]
 15:  222| [45] ["Should we go around and cut in from one of the other areas, then?"]
 16:  230| [47] [Watase]
 17:  233| [45] ["No, that'll waste too much time. Let's use the ladder in the elevator shaft."]
 18:  259| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  262| [45] ["Well, anything's fine with me. Shall we go already?"]
 20:  270| [47] [Ena]
 21:  273| [45] ["Yes."]
 22:  278| [45] [Watase headed for the elevator hall after getting Ena and Ukita's approval.]
 23:  379| [45] [--He then opened the elevator doors like last time and checked inside.]
 24:  427| [45] [The shaft was full with thick darkness.]
 25:  461| [47] [Ena]
 26:  464| [45] ["So we're supposed to climb up this?"]
 27:  527| [47] [Ukita]
 28:  530| [45] ["Hmm? You know, if you're scared, why don't you just stay here?"]
 29:  557| [47] [Ena]
 30:  560| [45] ["Don't be an idiot. I'm coming with you guys."]
 31:  568| [47] [Watase]
 32:  571| [45] ["No, hold on, Teach. I'll go first and check it just make sure it's safe."]
 33:  579| [47] [Watase]
 34:  582| [45] ["Then you guys can follow me once I give the OK."]
 35:  608| [47] [Ena]
 36:  611| [45] ["O-oh, really? ... Well okay then, but be careful."]
 37:  616| [45] [Watase nodded, then entered the shaft.]
 38:  670| [45] [He aimed for the top as he climbed his way up through the pitch-black darkness.]
 39:  675| [45] [He felt a bit nervous about the constant creaking the ladder was making.]
 40:  680| [45] [The ladder only got unsteadier the higher he climbed. Perhaps the fire that'd been upstairs had hit the elevator shaft as well.]
 41:  686| [47] [Watase]
 42:  687| [45] [(... This might be a bit hard on Teach.)]
 43:  698| [45] [Watase thought that as he closed in on B1--]
 44:  703| [45] [--but then heard voices coming from below.]
 45:  863| [47] [Ena]
 46:  866| [45] ["--... out what we were talking about earlier--"]
 47:  874| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  877| [45] ["--t is it?"]
 49:  882| [47] [Watase]
 50:  883| [45] [(Hmm?)]
 51:  888| [45] [Watase strained his ears.]
 52:  893| [45] [It seemed Ena and Ukita were talking downstairs.]
 53:  907| [47] [Ena]
 54:  910| [45] ["... You've been getting really up in our case lately.%NAll you do is say 'don't look at this' or 'don't look at that'."]
 55:  918| [47] [Ena]
 56:  921| [45] ["But how much do -you- know about this facility?"]
 57:  929| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  932| [45] ["Everything an Area 4 employee is required to know. What of it?"]
 59:  940| [47] [Ena]
 60:  943| [45] ["Quit playing dumb. You know stuff far more important than that, don't you?"]
 61:  971| [47] [Ukita]
 62:  974| [45] ["Like what?"]
 63:  982| [47] [Ena]
 64:  985| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? You know why this lockdown hasn't lifted yet!"]
 65:  993| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  996| [45] ["Like I said, it's because the radiation leakage control system--"]
 67: 1004| [47] [Ena]
 68: 1007| [45] ["Seriously!? You're saying that's the -only- reason!?"]
 69: 1035| [47] [Ukita]
 70: 1038| [45] ["Are you still going on about that!? Enough with your unwarranted suspicions!"]
 71: 1043| [45] [Ena and Ukita's voices were growing passionate.]
 72: 1048| [45] [It seemed yet another argument was erupting between them.]
 73: 1103| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1104| [45] [(Seriously!? I take my eyes of them for -one- damn minute and they're at it again!?)]
 75: 1109| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1110| [45] [(Pairing these two up was the worst idea ever!)]
 77: 1115| [45] [Watase tried to stop them from the shaft.]
 78: 1123| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1126| [45] ["Hey, cut it out! No fighting, you hear!?"]
 80: 1134| [47] [Ena]
 81: 1137| [45] ["Piss off, Captain Kasasagi! I just want to clear this whole thing up!"]
 82: 1142| [45] [But all he got in return was angry shouts from Ena.]
 83: 1147| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1148| [45] [(I seriously don't have the time for this--!)]
 85: 1153| [45] [Watase tried to quickly climb down the ladder to stop them--]
 86: 1165| [45] [--but then he heard a thick sound at his feet.]
 87: 1173| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1176| [45] ["!!"]
 89: 1181| [45] [The ladder's stair had broken!]
 90: 1186| [45] [Watase danced in the darkness for a moment, feeling as though he were floating.]
 91: 1191| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1192| [45] [(O-oh shit!)]
 93: 1197| [45] [All Watase could think to do was flap his arms wildly.]
 94: 1209| [45] [His hand then collided with something-- another one of the ladder's stairs!]
 95: 1214| [45] [He immediately grabbed on to it.]
 96: 1219| [45] [But at nearly the exact same moment--]
 97: 1234| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1237| [45] ["Gwaagh!!"]
 99: 1242| [45] [Watase's body hit the floor.]
100: 1250| [47] [Watase]
101: 1253| [45] ["..."]
102: 1258| [45] [He hit his back hard.]
103: 1263| [45] [The impact reached all the way up to his brain, quickly robbing him of his consciousness.]
104: 1271| [47] [Ena]
105: 1274| [45] ["Huh...?"]
106: 1282| [47] [Ena]
107: 1285| [45] ["H-hey, Captain Kasasagi!? Captain Kasasagi!!"]
108: 1290| [45] [As he passed out, Watase swore he could hear Ena shouting--]
