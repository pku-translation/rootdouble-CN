  1:   61| [45] [--The team finished up their search of B2 not three minutes later.]
  2:   66| [45] [But it had turned up fruitless, as always.]
  3:  128| [47] [Ena]
  4:  131| [45] ["... Shall we head up to B1 next?"]
  5:  139| [47] [Watase]
  6:  142| [45] ["Yeah, but-- the emergency staircase in this block has collapsed."]
  7:  169| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  172| [45] ["What? Then how did you search it last time?"]
  9:  180| [47] [Watase]
 10:  183| [45] ["We climbed up a rope instead of the stairs."]
 11:  191| [47] [Watase]
 12:  194| [45] ["But it might be too hard for you guys to climb it..."]
 13:  199| [45] [He could carry one of them on his back, but it would take far too much time with two or for them to climb the rope individually.]
 14:  225| [47] [Ena]
 15:  228| [45] ["Should we go around and cut in from one of the other areas, then?"]
 16:  236| [47] [Watase]
 17:  239| [45] ["No, that'll waste too much time. Let's use the ladder in the elevator shaft."]
 18:  265| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  268| [45] ["Well, anything's fine with me. Shall we go already?"]
 20:  276| [47] [Ena]
 21:  279| [45] ["Yes."]
 22:  284| [45] [Watase headed for the elevator hall after getting Ena and Ukita's approval.]
 23:  385| [45] [--He then opened the elevator doors like last time and checked inside.]
 24:  433| [45] [The shaft was full with thick darkness.]
 25:  467| [47] [Ena]
 26:  470| [45] ["So we're supposed to climb up this?"]
 27:  533| [47] [Ukita]
 28:  536| [45] ["Hmm? You know, if you're scared, why don't you just stay here?"]
 29:  563| [47] [Ena]
 30:  566| [45] ["Don't be an idiot. I'm coming with you guys."]
 31:  574| [47] [Watase]
 32:  577| [45] ["No, hold on, Teach. I'll go first and check it just make sure it's safe."]
 33:  585| [47] [Watase]
 34:  588| [45] ["Then you guys can follow me once I give the OK."]
 35:  614| [47] [Ena]
 36:  617| [45] ["O-oh, really? ... Well okay then, but be careful."]
 37:  622| [45] [Watase nodded, then entered the shaft.]
 38:  676| [45] [He aimed for the top as he climbed his way up through the pitch-black darkness.]
 39:  681| [45] [He felt a bit nervous about the constant creaking the ladder was making.]
 40:  686| [45] [The ladder only got unsteadier the higher he climbed. Perhaps the fire that'd been upstairs had hit the elevator shaft as well.]
 41:  692| [47] [Watase]
 42:  693| [45] [(... This might be a bit hard on Teach.)]
 43:  704| [45] [Watase thought that as he closed in on B1--]
 44:  709| [45] [--but then heard voices coming from below.]
 45:  869| [47] [Ena]
 46:  872| [45] ["--... out what we were talking about earlier--"]
 47:  880| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  883| [45] ["--t is it?"]
 49:  888| [47] [Watase]
 50:  889| [45] [(Hmm?)]
 51:  894| [45] [Watase strained his ears.]
 52:  899| [45] [It seemed Ena and Ukita were talking downstairs.]
 53:  913| [47] [Ena]
 54:  916| [45] ["... You've been getting really up in our case lately.%NAll you do is say 'don't look at this' or 'don't look at that'."]
 55:  924| [47] [Ena]
 56:  927| [45] ["But how much do -you- know about this facility?"]
 57:  935| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  938| [45] ["Everything an Area 4 employee is required to know. What of it?"]
 59:  946| [47] [Ena]
 60:  949| [45] ["Quit playing dumb. You know stuff far more important than that, don't you?"]
 61:  977| [47] [Ukita]
 62:  980| [45] ["Like what?"]
 63:  988| [47] [Ena]
 64:  991| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? You know why this lockdown hasn't lifted yet!"]
 65:  999| [47] [Ukita]
 66: 1002| [45] ["Like I said, it's because the radiation leakage control system--"]
 67: 1010| [47] [Ena]
 68: 1013| [45] ["Seriously!? You're saying that's the -only- reason!?"]
 69: 1041| [47] [Ukita]
 70: 1044| [45] ["Are you still going on about that!? Enough with your unwarranted suspicions!"]
 71: 1049| [45] [Ena and Ukita's voices were growing passionate.]
 72: 1054| [45] [It seemed yet another argument was erupting between them.]
 73: 1109| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1110| [45] [(Seriously!? I take my eyes of them for -one- damn minute and they're at it again!?)]
 75: 1115| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1116| [45] [(Pairing these two up was the worst idea ever!)]
 77: 1121| [45] [Watase tried to stop them from the shaft.]
 78: 1129| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1132| [45] ["Hey, cut it out! No fighting, you hear!?"]
 80: 1140| [47] [Ena]
 81: 1143| [45] ["Piss off, Captain Kasasagi! I just want to clear this whole thing up!"]
 82: 1148| [45] [But all he got in return was angry shouts from Ena.]
 83: 1153| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1154| [45] [(I seriously don't have the time for this--!)]
 85: 1159| [45] [Watase tried to quickly climb down the ladder to stop them--]
 86: 1171| [45] [--but then he heard a thick sound at his feet.]
 87: 1179| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1182| [45] ["!!"]
 89: 1187| [45] [The ladder's stair had broken!]
 90: 1192| [45] [Watase danced in the darkness for a moment, feeling as though he were floating.]
 91: 1197| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1198| [45] [(O-oh shit!)]
 93: 1203| [45] [All Watase could think to do was flap his arms wildly.]
 94: 1215| [45] [His hand then collided with something-- another one of the ladder's stairs!]
 95: 1220| [45] [He immediately grabbed on to it.]
 96: 1225| [45] [But at nearly the exact same moment--]
 97: 1240| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1243| [45] ["Gwaagh!!"]
 99: 1248| [45] [Watase's body hit the floor.]
100: 1256| [47] [Watase]
101: 1259| [45] ["..."]
102: 1264| [45] [He hit his back hard.]
103: 1269| [45] [The impact reached all the way up to his brain, quickly robbing him of his consciousness.]
104: 1277| [47] [Ena]
105: 1280| [45] ["Huh...?"]
106: 1288| [47] [Ena]
107: 1291| [45] ["H-hey, Captain Kasasagi!? Captain Kasasagi!!"]
108: 1296| [45] [As he passed out, Watase swore he could hear Ena shouting--]
