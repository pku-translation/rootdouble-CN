  1:   62| [45] [--Meanwhile, Watase was in the surveillance room--]
  2:   67| [45] [--attempting to fix the broken PA.]
  3:   72| [45] [If he could get it working, they could call together everyone who had been infected by malice. In theory, at least.]
  4:   77| [47] [Watase]
  5:   78| [45] [(... It's been about an hour since they announced that the place was switching to backup power.)]
  6:   83| [47] [Watase]
  7:   84| [45] [(That means the speakers are still online. Yet the PA can't handle facility-wide broadcasts anymore.)]
  8:   89| [47] [Watase]
  9:   90| [45] [(That means that there's a good chance one of the PA system circuits located near the surveillance room has been severed.)]
 10:  141| [45] [He searched the area under that assumption, discovering a burned off cable in the wall of the room that'd been hit by the backdraft earlier.]
 11:  149| [47] [Watase]
 12:  152| [45] ["... This is it! If I can just connect this...!"]
 13:  177| [45] [A thought crossed Watase's mind as he did repairs on it.]
 14:  265| [47] [Watase]
 15:  266| [45] [(We're getting closer and closer to escape... but what're Natsuhiko's thoughts on all this?)]
 16:  271| [45] [Natsuhiko had clearly stated his opposition to the deal Watase had made with Yuuri, but agreed to cooperate for the time being.]
 17:  276| [45] [But what move would he take once they got out of there?]
 18:  300| [47] [Watase]
 19:  301| [45] [(... He can probably erase my memories with just a thought.)]
 20:  306| [47] [Watase]
 21:  307| [45] [(So when this is all over, will he... erase my memories again...?)]
 22:  312| [45] [That suspicion crept its way into Watase's heart.]
 23:  336| [45] [Watase had looked into Communicators the best he could, but their true power was far greater than anything Watase had imagined.]
 24:  341| [45] [There were people out there who could dive into people's minds and manipulate their memories as they saw fit--]
 25:  346| [45] [There was nothing that frightened Watase more than that. Such people frightened him so much, he didn't find it that much of a stretch to label them "monsters".]
 26:  362| [47] [Watase]
 27:  363| [45] [(But even though they're not monsters... it's only natural for them to do that kind of stuff.)]
 28:  368| [47] [Watase]
 29:  369| [45] [(I'd probably do the same thing as Natsuhiko if I were in his shoes.)]
 30:  374| [45] [Of course, Watase could have just hidden his intention to take Yuuri to Q once everything was over.]
 31:  379| [45] [Then he would have kept his true thoughts a secret, worked himself to the bone to save everyone, gained Natsuhiko and Yuuri's trust--]
 32:  384| [45] [Then once they escaped, he would've knocked Natsuhiko unconscious and taken Yuuri away by force.]
 33:  389| [45] [But Watase never wanted to play foul like that. It just wasn't in him.]
 34:  394| [47] [Watase]
 35:  395| [45] [(... Then what do I want? Am I saying that I wanted to make things a bit more fair for Natsuhiko?)]
 36:  400| [47] [Watase]
 37:  401| [45] [(Why am I trying to act like a goody-two shoes now of all times? I'm supposed to be nothing more than a terrorist...)]
 38:  408| [45] [A thought crossed Watase's mind as he repaired it.]
 39:  413| [45] [He was remembering the conversation he just had with Natsuhiko.]
 40:  482| [47] [Watase]
 41:  485| [45] ["Once I've brought everyone here, and the malice erasure's complete, and you no longer have a use for me--"]
 42:  493| [47] [Watase]
 43:  496| [45] ["You're just going to erase my memory again, aren't you?"]
 44:  522| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  525| [45] ["Wh... what makes you say..."]
 46:  612| [45] [--He had figured out Natsuhiko's true intentions from that reaction alone.]
 47:  644| [45] [The boy really had been planning on erasing Watase's memories eventually.]
 48:  649| [47] [Watase]
 49:  650| [45] [(Well, can't blame him... He's no saint, after all.)]
 50:  691| [47] [Watase]
 51:  692| [45] [(Any normal boy out there would want to protect the girl most precious to them.)]
 52:  697| [47] [Watase]
 53:  698| [45] [(I'd probably do the same thing as Natsuhiko if I were in his shoes.)]
 54:  756| [45] [But he was still afraid.]
 55:  788| [45] [He was still afraid of the inevitable moment where Natsuhiko would betray him.]
 56:  793| [45] [Watase had looked into Communicators the best he could, but their true power was far greater than anything Watase had imagined.]
 57:  798| [45] [There were people out there who could dive into people's minds and manipulate their memories as they saw fit. There was nothing that frightened Watase more than that.]
 58:  837| [45] [He remembered what he'd told Natsuhiko in order to stave off that fear.]
 59:  842| [45] ["Well, erase it if you want, for all I care. Just know that the moment you do, that makes you a monster in the truest sense of the word."]
 60:  847| [47] [Watase]
 61:  848| [45] [(... Now that I've said all that, all I can do is hope Natsuhiko has a change of heart.)]
 62:  853| [47] [Watase]
 63:  854| [45] [(After all, I'm no match for him.)]
 64:  859| [45] [There were only two ways to avoid having his memories erased by Natsuhiko.]
 65:  864| [45] [The first was to leave Q and abandon his mission to secure a test subject.]
 66:  869| [45] [And the other one-- was to wait for Natsuhiko to see things his way.]
 67:  874| [47] [Watase]
 68:  875| [45] [(... But it'll be a cold day in Hell before that happens...)]
 69:  880| [47] [Watase]
 70:  881| [45] [(I highly doubt any Communicator would agree with our ideals.)]
 71:  935| [45] [It was because they knew that fact that Watase and Ukita had resorted to terrorism.]
 72:  940| [45] [But just as he couldn't get Natsuhiko to agree with him, neither could he abandon his mission.]
 73:  992| [45] [If he cast aside his duty at this point, then all he'd have to show for it were several victims.]
 74:  997| [45] [Rokumei City and LABO's wrongdoings would continue, as would their cover-up of the truth.]
 75: 1049| [45] [More and more people would have their human rights spat upon, be stripped of their freedom, and live a tortured existence.]
 76: 1054| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1055| [45] [(Why can't you understand that, Natsuhiko...!?)]
 78: 1069| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1070| [45] [(Your girl was confined in LABO for years too! Doesn't that mean anything to you!?)]
 80: 1075| [45] [Their wills were clashing fiercely against one another.]
 81: 1080| [45] [Watase felt the grip of melancholy upon his heart.]
 82: 1112| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1113| [45] [(Dammit... I feel like I could have gotten along with you if I'd been the way I was before.)]
 84: 1118| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1119| [45] [(Things were much better before I got my memories back.)]
 86: 1158| [45] [Just as Natsuhiko had said, now that he had his memories back, he was far past the point of no return.]
 87: 1163| [45] [Watase suddenly felt like he'd gone somewhere very far away.]
 88: 1168| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1169| [45] [(... Is it just me, or did something like this happen before?)]
 90: 1237| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1238| [45] [(Yeah, it was back when Kazami and I--)]
 92: 1255| [45] [But before he could finish that thought, he finished fixing the cable.]
 93: 1306| [45] [Watase pushed his thoughts aside and dashed back to the surveillance room.]
 94: 1363| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1364| [45] [(Well, I've got nothing to lose by trying...)]
 96: 1370| [45] [He flipped the on switch for the PA's mic as he thought that.]
 97: 1375| [45] [He then tried talking into it--]
 98: 1383| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1386| [45] ["Um... testing, testing."]
100: 1391| [45] [--and was met with the sound of his voice coming out of the speaker in the ceiling above him at the same time.]
101: 1399| [47] [Watase]
102: 1402| [45] ["Yes! I did it! It's working!"]
103: 1407| [45] [Watase celebrated, then prepared to try calling for Salyu first--]
104: 1415| [47] [Watase]
105: 1418| [45] ["--...!?"]
106: 1604| [45] [But at that moment, he noticed someone being displayed on one of the room's several monitors.]
107: 1623| [47] [Watase]
108: 1626| [45] ["Isn't that... Moribe!?"]
109: 1631| [45] [The image was coming from the camera located in B1 of Area 5's outer ring-- said camera was busted, so the footage was of poor quality, but he could still barely make out Jun.]
110: 1636| [45] [She was holding her engine cutter and pushing it against the wall.]
111: 1657| [47] [Watase]
112: 1660| [45] ["Oh crap! Did she notice the secret room!?"]
113: 1665| [45] [Destroying the shelter's opening mechanism had backfired on them.]
114: 1670| [45] [Anyone would get suspicious when something that hadn't been damaged before was suddenly destroyed the next time they saw it.]
115: 1675| [47] [Watase]
116: 1676| [45] [(Moribe hates the old man... He's in danger!)]
117: 1739| [45] [Watase rushed out of the surveillance room with that thought.]
118: 1744| [47] [Watase]
119: 1745| [45] [(That door should still hold for a while even against that engine cutter!)]
120: 1750| [47] [Watase]
121: 1751| [45] [(I just have to get to the shelter before she breaks through it--!)]
122: 1756| [45] [Watase continued his mad dash for Area 5.]
123: 1764| [45] [But he soon came to a halt.]
124: 1784| [47] [Watase]
125: 1785| [45] [(...!)]
126: 1816| [45] [He could see a shadow standing in his way, though it was too dim to tell who it was.]
127: 1821| [45] [The shadow stared at him and spoke.]
128: 1922| [47] [Ena]
129: 1925| [45] ["... Where are you going, Captain Kasasagi?"]
130: 1959| [45] [Ena then pointed a gun at Watase.]
