  5:   81| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
  6:  157| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  160| [45] ["Wh-what do we do, Hikorin... I'm scared...!"]
  8:  193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  196| [45] ["Don't cry, Yuuri! I'll do something!"]
 10:  201| [45] [--Natsuhiko found himself standing in the midst of fire.]
 11:  206| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  207| [45] [(Is this... nine years ago...?)]
 13:  212| [45] [It was the day Yuuri and Natsuhiko had sneaked into LABO.]
 14:  217| [45] [Natsuhiko was watching the memory of when they were trapped in Area 5, but through Yuuri's eyes--]
 15:  311| [45] [--They fled into a nearby room as the fires drew close.]
 16:  316| [45] [But the smoke and the heat had sapped Yuuri's body of its energy.]
 17:  335| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at her with tears welling in his eyes.]
 18:  361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  364| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri... it's all because I took you with me..."]
 20:  372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  375| [45] ["I tried to act cool and say I'd save Mom..."]
 22:  383| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  386| [45] ["But I couldn't, and now I got you trapped in this mess..."]
 24:  412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  415| [45] ["I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...!"]
 26:  420| [45] [It wrenched Yuuri's heart to hear those words.]
 27:  425| [45] [So she gently wiped away his tears.]
 28:  433| [47] [Yuuri]
 29:  436| [45] ["... It's okay, Hikorin..."]
 30:  444| [47] [Yuuri]
 31:  447| [45] ["It's because you're always trying your hardest, for everyone else..."]
 32:  455| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  458| [45] ["I loved that about you..."]
 34:  466| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  469| [45] ["So I'm glad... that you stayed with me... until the end."]
 36:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  524| [45] ["Yuuri...!"]
 38:  529| [45] [Natsuhiko embraced Yuuri.]
 39:  591| [45] [But she could no longer feel his touch, nor the numbness of her own body.]
 40:  596| [45] [As her consciousness faded, only one thing remained in Yuuri's mind.]
 41:  601| [47] [Yuuri]
 42:  602| [45] [(... Please, God...)]
 43:  607| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  608| [45] [(I don't care... what happens to me...)]
 45:  613| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  614| [45] [(But if you can save at least one of us...)]
 47:  619| [47] [Yuuri]
 48:  620| [45] [(... please save Hikorin...!)]
 49:  625| [45] [And as if in response to her prayer--]
 50:  630| [45] [Yuuri heard a voice beside her ear.]
 51:  705| [85] [{Someone come save us!}]
 52:  706| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  707| [86] [{Someone come save us!}]
 54:  722| [85] [{We're in Dr. Tenkawa's room!}]
 55:  723| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  724| [86] [{We're in Dr. Tenkawa's room!}]
 57:  752| [45] [--No, it wasn't beside her ear.]
 58:  757| [45] [It sounded like it was echoing directly inside her head--]
 59:  762| [47] [Yuuri]
 60:  763| [45] [(T... telepathy?)]
 61:  768| [47] [Yuuri]
 62:  769| [45] [(Hikorin used telepathy...?)]
 63:  937| [45] [But even that thought of hers began to disappear.]
 64:  942| [45] [As her sight and hearing faded-- Yuuri heard another voice.]
 65:  950| [47] [???]
 66:  953| [45] ["--hiko! Natsuhiko!"]
 67: 1014| [47] [Miyoko]
 68: 1017| [45] ["Ahh, Yuuri too...!"]
 69: 1043| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1046| [45] ["M-Mom...!"]
 71: 1072| [47] [Miyoko]
 72: 1075| [45] ["Thank goodness you're safe!"]
 73: 1101| [47] [Miyoko]
 74: 1104| [45] ["I came here to save you! Let's take Yuuri and get out of here!"]
 75: 1109| [45] [And right after she barely managed to hear the professor yelling--]
 76: 1215| [45] [--Yuuri lost consciousness.]
 77: 1274| [45] [------]
 78: 1279| [45] [----]
 79: 1284| [45] [--And after who knew how long--]
 80: 1292| [47] [Miyoko]
 81: 1295| [45] ["...ri...!"]
 82: 1303| [47] [Miyoko]
 83: 1306| [45] ["Yuuri...!"]
 84: 1311| [45] [Yuuri woke up at the sound of her name.]
 85: 1398| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1401| [45] ["Mmm... mmm..."]
 87: 1406| [45] [When she opened her eyes, she saw Dr. Tenkawa.]
 88: 1432| [47] [Miyoko]
 89: 1435| [45] ["Thank goodness. You're awake."]
 90: 1443| [47] [Yuuri]
 91: 1446| [45] ["Huh... what...?"]
 92: 1454| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1457| [45] ["What happened... to me...?"]
 94: 1483| [47] [Miyoko]
 95: 1486| [45] ["You don't remember?"]
 96: 1494| [47] [Miyoko]
 97: 1497| [45] ["After you got caught in a fire in LABO, you were asleep for an entire day."]
 98: 1502| [45] [Yuuri looked around.]
 99: 1507| [45] [She appeared to be in a hospital room, but Natsuhiko was nowhere to be seen.]
100: 1515| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1518| [45] ["Umm... where's Hikorin?"]
102: 1541| [45] [But without answering Yuuri's question, the professor asked her a question of her own.]
103: 1549| [47] [Miyoko]
104: 1552| [45] ["By the way, Yuuri."]
105: 1560| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 1563| [45] ["I'm sorry for asking this right after you woke up, but... can I get you to take a little test with me?"]
107: 1571| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1574| [45] ["A test?"]
109: 1600| [47] [Miyoko]
110: 1603| [45] ["We need to make sure your body hasn't developed any problems."]
111: 1629| [47] [Miyoko]
112: 1632| [45] ["You two were bombarded with hazardous particles, you see."]
113: 1637| [45] [Yuuri didn't know what "hazardous particles" were and her head felt a little groggy--%Nbut she answered obediently nonetheless.]
114: 1645| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1648| [45] ["Okay."]
116: 1710| [45] [--Afterwards, Yuuri underwent various tests.]
117: 1715| [45] [They took blood and urine samples and put her inside a giant machine to take pictures of what was inside her head.]
118: 1720| [45] [At first, Dr. Tenkawa seemed the same as usual-- but as the tests progressed, the look on her face froze over.]
119: 1790| [47] [Miyoko]
120: 1793| [45] ["--Yuuri's 'IGF2R gene' is Type S...!?"]
121: 1798| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa perused the test results on a PDA as she spoke with someone who appeared to be an assistant.]
122: 1806| [47] [Miyoko]
123: 1809| [45] ["That's impossible. Are you sure there's no mistake?"]
124: 1824| [47] [Assistant]
125: 1827| [45] ["W-we've redone the test several times... and it's turned out Type S each time."]
126: 1835| [47] [Miyoko]
127: 1838| [45] ["No, it couldn't be...!"]
128: 1882| [45] [The professor turned to Yuuri with a serious look on her face and asked her a question.]
129: 1890| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1893| [45] ["Yuuri, what was your BC aptitude? They've measured you in school, right?"]
131: 1901| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1904| [45] ["Umm... it's 'C'."]
133: 1912| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1915| [45] ["..."]
135: 1920| [45] [As the professor sunk into silence, her assistant whispered into her ear.]
136: 1964| [47] [Assistant]
137: 1967| [45] ["It's exactly as she says..."]
138: 1972| [47] [Assistant]
139: 1975| [45] ["All of her past examination results have recorded her IGF2R gene as Type C."]
140: 2022| [47] [Miyoko]
141: 2025| [45] ["H-hold it right there. You mean to say--"]
142: 2033| [47] [Miyoko]
143: 2036| [45] ["Her gene mutated!?"]
144: 2041| [45] [Even the look on the assistant's face changed when she said that last word.]
145: 2088| [47] [Miyoko]
146: 2091| [45] ["Y-Yuuri! Can you try using telepathy for me!?"]
147: 2099| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2102| [45] ["Huh? But I haven't been able to use telepathy yet--"]
149: 2110| [47] [Miyoko]
150: 2113| [45] ["That's what I thought, but please, try!"]
151: 2121| [47] [Miyoko]
152: 2124| [45] ["Focus on something you want to tell me. Anything!"]
153: 2129| [45] [It was hard to think of something on the spot like that-- but Yuuri did as she was told.]
154: 2134| [47] [Yuuri]
155: 2135| [45] [(I've never used telepathy before, but...)]
156: 2140| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 2141| [45] [(Um... Let's see...)]
158: 2213| [47] [Yuuri]
159: 2216| [45] [{Does it look like Hikorin will be okay?}]
160: 2295| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 2298| [45] ["!!"]
162: 2303| [45] [The professor audibly gasped.]
163: 2308| [45] [And at the same time, Yuuri felt something strange as well.]
164: 2313| [45] [It felt completely different from all the times she had tried and failed to use telepathy before.]
165: 2318| [45] [--It was almost like the thought she had weaved inside her head had spewed out--]
166: 2367| [47] [Miyoko]
167: 2370| [45] ["... Yuuri, you're worried about Natsuhiko, aren't you..."]
168: 2378| [47] [Yuuri]
169: 2381| [45] ["Ah... y-yeah."]
170: 2386| [45] [The professor responded to Yuuri's question.]
171: 2391| [45] [The question she only thought of inside her head.]
172: 2399| [47] [Miyoko]
173: 2402| [45] ["... Okay, then. Now I'll think of the answer to your question inside my head."]
174: 2410| [47] [Miyoko]
175: 2413| [45] ["Use BC to try and read that answer."]
176: 2421| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 2424| [45] ["Huh? But isn't that empathy...?"]
178: 2432| [47] [Miyoko]
179: 2435| [45] ["Please, just try it."]
180: 2440| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2441| [45] [(B-but why? I can't pull that off...)]
182: 2446| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 2447| [45] [(Mashiron said hardly any kids out there can use empathy...)]
184: 2505| [45] [But even so, Yuuri focused hard to try and read the professor's mind.]
185: 2510| [45] [And soon enough-- Yuuri heard a voice echoing inside her head.]
186: 2799| [85] [{Natsuhiko's sleeping in another hospital room. There's no need to worry.}]
187: 2800| [86] [Miyoko]
188: 2801| [86] [{Natsuhiko's sleeping in another hospital room. There's no need to worry.}]
189: 2951| [47] [Yuuri]
190: 2954| [45] ["!!"]
191: 2959| [45] [This time Yuuri was surprised for sure.]
192: 2964| [45] [The professor hadn't moved her mouth at all. And yet Yuuri heard her voice--!!]
193: 2969| [47] [Yuuri]
194: 2970| [45] [(Her mental voice...!)]
195: 2975| [45] [Yuuri relayed what she heard from that voice back to the professor.]
196: 2983| [47] [Yuuri]
197: 2986| [45] ["H... Hikorin's... sleeping?"]
198: 3034| [47] [Miyoko]
199: 3037| [45] ["...!!"]
200: 3045| [47] [Miyoko]
201: 3048| [45] ["... That's right. That's exactly right."]
202: 3053| [45] [The assistant spoke up mere moments after the professor had just barely managed to wring those words out.]
203: 3097| [47] [Assistant]
204: 3100| [45] ["P-professor, could this be...?"]
205: 3108| [47] [Miyoko]
206: 3111| [45] ["It's hard to believe... but it appears she's rapidly begun to demonstrate use of both telepathy and empathy."]
207: 3119| [47] [Miyoko]
208: 3122| [45] ["There's no room for doubt here... She's an Acquired Rank S Aptitude Communicator."]
209: 3127| [47] [Assistant]
210: 3130| [45] ["B-but how did this happen!?"]
211: 3177| [47] [Miyoko]
212: 3180| [45] ["During the accident, the WX particle energy in Area 5 reached a maximum of 9500 mSv--"]
213: 3188| [47] [Miyoko]
214: 3191| [45] ["--which damaged her gene and caused it to reconstruct itself to best suit its environment."]
215: 3199| [47] [Miyoko]
216: 3202| [45] ["But I never expected a theoretical phenomenon like that to be realized in such a fashion."]
217: 3207| [47] [Assistant]
218: 3210| [45] ["Then do you mean-- the same happened to the boy that was with her!?"]
219: 3218| [47] [Miyoko]
220: 3221| [45] ["I cannot rule out that possibility...!"]
221: 3226| [45] [The professor looked at Yuuri and spoke in a low voice.]
222: 3273| [47] [Miyoko]
223: 3276| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri, but please wait in this room for a little while."]
224: 3284| [47] [Miyoko]
225: 3287| [45] ["I need to go do some tests with Natsuhiko too."]
226: 3295| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 3298| [45] ["Um... was something wrong?"]
228: 3306| [47] [Miyoko]
229: 3309| [45] ["... Normally, I'd say these were good results, but..."]
230: 3317| [47] [Miyoko]
231: 3320| [45] ["Anyway, I'll be back soon."]
232: 3325| [45] [And with that, Dr. Tenkawa and her assistant left the room.]
233: 3397| [47] [Yuuri]
234: 3398| [45] [(...)]
235: 3403| [45] [Left all alone, Yuuri suddenly felt scared.]
236: 3408| [45] [Even an easygoing person like her could tell...]
237: 3413| [45] [that things were about to get out of hand somehow...]
