 39:  384| [45] [At the same time Natsuhiko felt something off about some of the descriptors--]
 40:  432| [45] [--a bizarre sight suddenly flickered in Watase's brain.]

 57:  815| [45] [The event took Natsuhiko by surprise, and one second later-- Watase fled out of the room.]
 58:  864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  865| [45] [(Wha!? Wh-what the hell's he doing!?)]
 60:  870| [45] [For some reason, Watase was in complete disarray. His mind was whirling with rage and discomfort.]
 61:  875| [45] [And once again, past memories came back--]
 62:  955| [47] [Yuuri]
 63:  958| [45] ["Why did you do something so horrible to me back then...!?"]
 64: 1017| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1018| [45] [(!! I swore I erased that memory...!)]
 66: 1023| [45] [But that memory came bursting out nevertheless.]

 81: 1395| [45] [Bewildered, Watase tottered out of the stairwell.]

 93: 1836| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1837| [45] [("The test subjects are dangerous"? ... What's gotten into him...!?)]
 95: 1842| [45] [Natsuhiko was left in confusion as that idea rose up inside of Watase--]
 96: 1847| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1848| [45] [(Don't tell me--!)]
 98: 1914| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1915| [45] [(Don't tell me -she- was a "test subject"!?)]
100: 1920| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1921| [45] [(Is that why reading the document provoked Watase's memories--!?)]
102: 1926| [45] [Natsuhiko panicked and dove deeper into Watase's mind.]
103: 2028| [85] [{The test subjects are dangerous...!]
104: 2030| [85] [ The test subjects are dangerous...!]
105: 2032| [85] [  The test subjects are dangerous...!}]
106: 2033| [86] [Watase]
107: 2034| [86] [{The test subjects are dangerous...! The test subjects are dangerous...! The test subjects are dangerous...!}]
108: 2051| [85] [{Wh... what the hell was that!? What the hell were those words!?}]
109: 2052| [86] [Watase]
110: 2053| [86] [{Wh... what the hell was that!? What the hell were those words!?}]
111: 2068| [85] [{I don't know them! I've never heard those words before!!}]
112: 2069| [86] [Watase]
113: 2070| [86] [{I don't know them! I've never heard those words before!!}]
114: 2098| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 2099| [45] [(What is this...!?)]
116: 2104| [45] [It was clear that Watase was fearfully resisting the hatred that was seething within his mind.]
117: 2109| [45] [But the jet-black hatred gradually corroded that fear, painting it out.]
118: 2114| [45] [The hatred then evolved further into murderous intent.]
119: 2119| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2120| [45] [(If this keeps up, Watase will revert back to how he was back then! I need to do something about his memories!)]
121: 2125| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 2126| [45] [(... No, but then...!)]
123: 2131| [45] [Considering the damage memory erasure inflicted upon Watase, any further memory erasure could very well kill him.]
124: 2136| [45] [And naturally, if Watase died, Natsuhiko would vanish.]
125: 2141| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 2142| [45] [(Then what do I do!? How can I seal Watase's hatred!?)]
127: 2147| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 2148| [45] [(Think! There's got to be a way!)]
129: 2153| [45] [--Watase was scared of Yuuri for some reason. He hated her and wanted to murder her.]
130: 2158| [45] [Even though normally, he cared for her and tried to keep her safe.]
131: 2163| [45] [Each time his memories threatened to return, so too would his fear, hatred, and murderous intent.]
132: 2168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 2169| [45] [(In that case, why don't I just get the jump on Watase...)]
134: 2174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2175| [45] [(And give him the misconception that "she's already dead"?)]
136: 2180| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2181| [45] [(I'm sure that would erase his fear of her, as well as his hatred and murderous intent...!)]
138: 2186| [45] [He didn't know if it would work.]
139: 2191| [45] [But if he left things as-is, Watase could very well regain his memories.]
140: 2196| [45] [Natsuhiko had no choice but to take chances with his plan.]
141: 2204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2207| [45] [{Create an image of a "dead Yuuri" in Watase's memory--!}]
143: 2328| [45] [--And thus, Natsuhiko fabricated another memory for Watase.]
144: 2439| [45] [Five minutes later--]
145: 2444| [45] [Watase remained frozen on the spot as if he were dead.]
146: 2449| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 2450| [45] [(Hey... how long do you plan to stay like that...!?)]
148: 2455| [45] [Driven by anxiety, Natsuhiko called out to Watase.]
149: 2463| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2466| [45] [{--Hey, get a hold of yourself already!}]
151: 2474| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2477| [45] [{How long are you gonna space out for!? Hurry up and get back to the others!}]
153: 2494| [47] [Watase]
154: 2497| [45] ["!!"]
155: 2502| [45] [Watase was shaken back to consciousness by Natsuhiko's voice.]
156: 2507| [45] [He then tottered back to the factory where everyone was waiting.]
157: 2512| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 2513| [45] [(... Looks like it'd be best for me not to tamper with your memory any further than this.)]
159: 2518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2519| [45] [(So please, Watase. Don't try to regain your memory anymore...!)]
161: 2524| [45] [Natsuhiko prayed.]
162: 2567| [45] [--But the distortion caused by his actions was soon exposed.]
