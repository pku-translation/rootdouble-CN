  1:  103| [47] [Watase]
  2:  106| [45] ["... What's up, Teach? You're worrying about your students again, aren't you?"]
  3:  138| [47] [Ena]
  4:  141| [45] ["Huh...?"]
  5:  149| [47] [Watase]
  6:  152| [45] ["It'll be fine. That surveillance camera footage showed that there's a big chance they're in either Area 5 or 6."]
  7:  160| [47] [Watase]
  8:  163| [45] ["They shouldn't have gotten caught up in the fire in this area."]
  9:  168| [45] [Watase said that knowing he was trying to convince himself of that as much as he was trying to convince Ena.]
 10:  173| [45] [He was doing his best to avoid bringing up that Ena had seen one of her students in this very area almost an hour ago.]
 11:  178| [45] [But Ena still looked glum.]
 12:  204| [47] [Ena]
 13:  207| [45] ["... The fire's not all I'm worried about."]
 14:  215| [47] [Watase]
 15:  218| [45] ["Huh?"]
 16:  226| [47] [Ena]
 17:  229| [45] ["I'm more concerned about the radiation..."]
 18:  255| [47] [Ena]
 19:  258| [45] ["I mean, your Procyon said that the radiation levels here are over 5000 mSv, right?"]
 20:  266| [47] [Watase]
 21:  269| [45] ["R-right."]
 22:  295| [47] [Ena]
 23:  298| [45] ["It doesn't feel that way at all... but still, this level of radiation would normally kill you, right?"]
 24:  306| [47] [Ena]
 25:  309| [45] ["We don't even know if the AD is actually protecting us from this level..."]
 26:  314| [47] [Watase]
 27:  315| [45] ["..."]
 28:  320| [45] [The first danger standard was "4000-8000 mSv", which referred to an area that they wouldn't want to stay for long in even with AD.]
 29:  328| [47] [Watase]
 30:  331| [45] ["... Yeah, it'd be best for both the survivors -and- us not to overstay our welcome here."]
 31:  357| [47] [Ena]
 32:  360| [45] ["Indeed. Especially me and Ms. Tachibana..."]
 33:  368| [47] [Watase]
 34:  371| [45] ["Huh? Tachibana I get, but why you?"]
 35:  397| [47] [Ena]
 36:  400| [45] ["Don't you remember?"]
 37:  408| [47] [Ena]
 38:  411| [45] ["I didn't take any AD until you guys found me."]
 39:  419| [47] [Watase]
 40:  422| [45] ["!!"]
 41:  427| [45] [Watase was filled with shock.]
 42:  432| [45] [Now that he thought about it, she was absolutely right. Ena hadn't even known about the meltdown until the group had told her.]
 43:  458| [47] [Ena]
 44:  461| [45] ["The Procyon's reading was still low then, so I don't think my cumulative exposure is all that high..."]
 45:  469| [47] [Watase]
 46:  472| [45] ["N-no, hold on! You say that, but you can never be too careful in this situation!"]
 47:  480| [47] [Watase]
 48:  483| [45] ["You should tell Tachibana and sit out the search of this area or--"]
 49:  509| [47] [Ena]
 50:  512| [45] ["Oh my, don't kid yourself. There's no way I can just rest while everyone else is working as hard as they can."]
 51:  520| [47] [Watase]
 52:  523| [45] ["..."]
 53:  528| [45] [Watase took a long hard look at Ena's face.]
 54:  533| [45] [He'd only thought of her as a naggy woman, but--]
 55:  541| [47] [Watase]
 56:  544| [45] ["... You're amazing, Teach..."]
 57:  570| [47] [Ena]
 58:  573| [45] ["Huh? How so?"]
 59:  581| [47] [Watase]
 60:  584| [45] ["How do I put it... 'you've got a heart of steel' or something...? Anyway, you're an amazing woman."]
 61:  610| [47] [Ena]
 62:  613| [45] ["Heh, don't tell me you're falling for me?"]
 63:  621| [47] [Watase]
 64:  624| [45] ["A little."]
 65:  650| [47] [Ena]
 66:  653| [45] ["..."]
 67:  658| [45] [Ena completely went quiet in a second.]
 68:  684| [47] [Ena]
 69:  687| [45] ["... Wait a minute, this isn't the time for jokes, right? You -do- know what we're dealing with right now, don't you?"]
 70:  695| [47] [Watase]
 71:  698| [45] ["Oh? I was just playing along with your joke. Weren't you?"]
 72:  724| [47] [Ena]
 73:  727| [45] ["Oh, uh, right... Anyway, got it, I'll be careful about my health."]
 74:  732| [45] [Ena looked away when she said that.]
 75:  758| [47] [Ena]
 76:  761| [45] ["Let's cut the silly chit-chat and get back to searching."]
 77:  769| [47] [Watase]
 78:  772| [45] ["R-right."]
 79:  777| [45] [Watase nodded after a bit of thinking, then focused on the search.]
 80:  822| [45] [He and Ena finished searching the hallway and headed on over to the elevator hall.]
