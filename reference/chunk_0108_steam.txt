  1:   92| [47] [Jun]
  2:   95| [45] ["W-what do you mean by 'something'...?"]
  3:  103| [47] [Kazami]
  4:  106| [45] ["Moribe, use the air jack and the engine cutter!"]
  5:  114| [47] [Jun]
  6:  117| [45] ["But aren't they in Area 2? We don't have time to go all the way back for the--"]
  7:  125| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  128| [45] ["Yes we do! It shouldn't take that long if you go through Area 1 to get there!"]
  9:  133| [45] [That was exactly what Watase had been thinking-- his instincts had been right after all.]
 10:  141| [47] [Kazami]
 11:  144| [45] ["Moribe, please bring them here ASAP!"]
 12:  152| [47] [Jun]
 13:  155| [45] ["Roger! I'll be back in two minutes tops, so hang in there, Captain!"]
 14:  169| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  172| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, help me try to get as much debris off as possible until Moribe returns!"]
 16:  180| [47] [Ena]
 17:  183| [45] ["Okay, let's get started now!"]
 18:  191| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  194| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
 20:  202| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  205| [45] ["Start moving this debris off!"]
 22:  231| [45] [Jun left the factory as Kazami, Ena, and Ukita started removing the debris.]
 23:  236| [45] [But a minute later--]
 24:  241| [45] [Watase's arms started shaking rapidly.]
 25:  249| [47] [Watase]
 26:  252| [45] ["Khh...!"]
 27:  257| [45] [He couldn't imagine how many kilograms he was holding up.]
 28:  262| [45] [His spread elbows creaked, feeling like they'd snap like twigs at any second.]
 29:  267| [47] [Watase]
 30:  268| [45] [(Moribe... please hurry up...!)]
 31:  273| [45] [Yuuri's faced scrunched up grimly as if she could tell what Watase was feeling.]
 32:  321| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  324| [45] ["I'm so sorry... it's all my fault that you got trapped here too..."]
 34:  332| [47] [Watase]
 35:  335| [45] ["Y-you dummy... don't... apologize for nothing..."]
 36:  343| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  346| [45] ["O-okay..."]
 38:  354| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  357| [45] ["... But why..."]
 40:  365| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  368| [45] ["Why are you going this far to save my life?"]
 42:  376| [47] [Watase]
 43:  379| [45] ["W-why? Well..."]
 44:  384| [45] [It was then that Watase remembered--]
 45:  485| [85] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
 46:  486| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 47:  487| [86] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
 48:  594| [45] [--the voice he'd heard in his head shortly after he'd woken up.]
 49:  599| [47] [Watase]
 50:  600| [45] [(I see... so ever since I heard that voice, I've been...)]
 51:  608| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  611| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi...?"]
 53:  616| [45] [Yuuri looked confused at Watase's sudden silence.]
 54:  621| [45] [It was at that moment that they heard Jun's voice.]
 55:  635| [47] [Jun]
 56:  638| [45] ["Sorry to keep you all waiting! What's the situation!?"]
 57:  646| [47] [Watase]
 58:  649| [45] ["Pretty... bad... to be honest... h-hurry up!"]
 59:  657| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  660| [45] ["Understood! Moribe, get the air jack ready ASAP!"]
 61:  668| [47] [Jun]
 62:  671| [45] ["It's on standby now! Your orders!?"]
 63:  679| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  682| [45] ["First, cut along this line from here to there with the engine cutter!"]
 65:  690| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  693| [45] ["Put the air jack in the newly created hole after that! Then lift the debris up and get those two out of there!"]
 67:  701| [47] [Jun]
 68:  704| [45] ["Roger! Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, get back now!"]
 69:  712| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  715| [45] ["Now commencing cutting procedure!"]
 71:  736| [45] [The two rescue workers then began removing the debris--]
 72:  741| [47] [Watase]
 73:  742| [45] [(Ghh... g-goddammit...!)]
 74:  747| [45] [But the strength in Watase's arms was fading quickly.]
 75:  752| [45] [It wouldn't surprise him if the weight of the debris won out any second now.]
 76:  757| [47] [Watase]
 77:  758| [45] [(I-I would have ordered Tachibana and Moribe right away back then if I'd known... this was going... to happen...)]
 78:  763| [45] [Those lost ten seconds had cost him everything.]
 79:  777| [47] [Yuuri]
 80:  780| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi...!"]
 81:  785| [45] [Yuuri looked anxious.]
 82:  790| [45] [But Watase no longer had the composure to say anything comforting to her.]
 83:  795| [45] [The debris was sinking further and further into his back.]
 84:  800| [45] [That was merely an illusion, but one that felt more than real enough.]
 85:  805| [47] [Watase]
 86:  806| [45] [(Moribe... please hurry up...!)]
 87:  811| [45] [That one second felt-------- so long.]
 88:  816| [45] [The vibrations of the engine cutter were like poison to Watase now.]
 89:  821| [45] [And at the end of what felt like an eternity of agony--]
 90:  874| [45] [Part of the debris was removed, and a light shone in on Yuuri's face.]
 91:  879| [45] [But at that moment--]
 92:  884| [45] [Watase hit his limit.]
 93:  889| [45] [He could tell that the muscle fibers in his arms were starting to burst.]
 94:  894| [45] [He really didn't have any more time.]
 95:  899| [47] [Watase]
 96:  900| [45] [(Sh... shit... I've got to make sure... that at least Yuuri... gets out...!)]
 97:  905| [45] [With Yuuri's small body, it was probably possible for her to escape through the hole that'd been opened just now.]
 98:  913| [47] [Kazami]
 99:  916| [45] ["Captain, put up with it for a little longer! We're getting the air jack rea--"]
100:  921| [45] [Watase forced his voice out in order to interrupt her.]
101:  929| [47] [Watase]
102:  932| [45] ["Tachibana...! Pull Yuuri out right now...!"]
103:  940| [47] [Yuuri]
104:  943| [45] ["Huh...?"]
105:  951| [47] [Kazami]
106:  954| [45] ["C-Captain?"]
107:  962| [47] [Watase]
108:  965| [45] ["--Tachibana, hurry! This is an order!"]
109:  970| [45] [It was practically a miracle that he'd managed to shout that.]
110:  978| [47] [Kazami]
111:  981| [45] ["Y-yes!"]
112:  986| [45] [Kazami took Yuuri's hand and quickly pulled her outside.]
113: 1035| [45] [The strength in Watase's arms then gave way then and there.]
114: 1113| [45] [His body was pulverized by the debris.]
115: 1118| [45] [--UGYAAAAAAAAAAAGH!]
116: 1123| [45] [That horrific scream burst out of his mouth.]
117: 1131| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1134| [45] ["CAPTAIN--!"]
119: 1142| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1145| [45] ["NOOOOOOOOOOO!"]
121: 1150| [45] [Bones all throughout his body broke and pierced his lungs.]
122: 1155| [45] [He nearly passed out from the sheer pain of it all.]
123: 1160| [45] [A thought crossed Watase's mind amidst all that.]
124: 1165| [45] ["I'm glad I saved Yuuri."]
125: 1170| [45] [But another thought simultaneously hit him.]
126: 1175| [45] ["But were my actions just now really 'my actions'?"]
127: 1180| [45] [--Or maybe--]
128: 1281| [85] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
129: 1282| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
130: 1283| [86] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
131: 1354| [45] [--if I'd never heard that voice--]
132: 1359| [45] [At that moment, it felt as if everything he'd been up until that point hadn't really been him.]
133: 1364| [45] [And just as Watase's conviction faded from his body...]
134: 1369| [45] [... his mind fell into darkness.]
