  0:   80| [45] [--It was a memory of just a few days ago--]
  1:   85| [45] [The night Salyu arrived at the Tenkawa residence.]
  2:   90| [45] [Mashiro discussed with Natsuhiko about how they should handle Salyu...]
  3:  131| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  134| [45] ["--Go talk to her some more so she can relax a bit, okay?"]
  5:  139| [45] [Once Mashiro made that suggestion, Natsuhiko looked a little troubled... but then he nodded.]
  6:  165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  168| [45] ["Okay, I guess I'll give it a shot."]
  8:  173| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  176| [45] ["That answer again?"]
 10:  202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  205| [45] ["Ah, no, it's not like I'm trying to just blow you off or anything."]
 12:  210| [47] [Mashiro]
 13:  213| [45] ["Hahah, nah, it's okay. I'm counting on you."]
 14:  218| [47] [Mashiro]
 15:  221| [45] ["Well, see you tomorrow, Natsuhiko."]
 16:  247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  250| [45] ["Yeah, later."]
 18:  255| [45] [Mashiro responded with a smile and departed.]
 19:  380| [45] [She walked the short distance back home alone.]
 20:  385| [45] [But once her house came into view-- someone suddenly called to her from the darkness.]
 21:  405| [47] [???]
 22:  408| [45] ["Mashiro?"]
 23:  413| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  416| [45] ["Hyes!?"]
 25:  421| [45] [Mashiro jumped in surprise.]
 26:  540| [45] [When she turned towards the voice, she saw Dr. Tenkawa standing there.]
 27:  603| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  606| [45] ["Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you."]
 29:  611| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  614| [45] ["P-Professor!? What's wrong? Didn't you go back to LABO?"]
 31:  622| [47] [Miyoko]
 32:  625| [45] ["I wanted to talk to you, so I waited."]
 33:  630| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  633| [45] ["!"]
 35:  659| [47] [Miyoko]
 36:  662| [45] ["It's about Yui... I figured it'd be best if I explained a little more to you in detail."]
 37:  734| [45] [The professor explained more about Salyu.]
 38:  739| [45] [How she had been raised by strict parents and rarely ever left home.]
 39:  744| [45] [And how the professor couldn't bear to see her like that, and temporarily took custody of her...]
 40:  828| [47] [Miyoko]
 41:  831| [45] ["... Having Yui and Natsuhiko live together is a bit of a gamble, but..."]
 42:  839| [47] [Miyoko]
 43:  842| [45] ["I believe it's for Natsuhiko's sake just as much as it is for Yui's."]
 44:  847| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  850| [45] ["For Natsuhiko's sake?"]
 46:  876| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  879| [45] ["That boy's just a little too cold towards others, isn't he?"]
 48:  887| [47] [Miyoko]
 49:  890| [45] ["He doesn't let his guard down around anybody except for you and Yuuri."]
 50:  916| [47] [Miyoko]
 51:  919| [45] ["Even though he excels at perceiving other people's minds, too."]
 52:  924| [47] [Mashiro]
 53:  927| [45] ["... Right."]
 54:  932| [45] [--He seemed completely incapable of perceiving other people's romantic advances, but Mashiro dared not mention that little detail.]
 55:  958| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  961| [45] ["But actually, Yui has the complete opposite disposition."]
 57:  969| [47] [Miyoko]
 58:  972| [45] ["Yui is extremely poor at perceiving other people's minds, but she dearly desires to connect with others."]
 59:  998| [47] [Miyoko]
 60: 1001| [45] ["And while introducing those two might cause them to clash at first..."]
 61: 1027| [47] [Miyoko]
 62: 1030| [45] ["I feel that the two of them can complete each other's deficiencies."]
 63: 1035| [47] [Mashiro]
 64: 1038| [45] ["Yeah. That seems like a good idea."]
 65: 1043| [45] [Previously, the professor, Mashiro, and Natsuhiko's doctor had thought that to treat his mental condition, they should give him more opportunities to establish deep connections with other people.]
 66: 1048| [45] [That way, they could reduce his dependency on Yuuri at least a little.]
 67: 1053| [45] [That was probably why the professor had arranged for Salyu to live in the Tenkawa residence, but...]
 68: 1058| [47] [Mashiro]
 69: 1061| [45] ["But why don't you tell Natsuhiko directly? He's quite confused by this turn of events, you know?"]
 70: 1087| [47] [Miyoko]
 71: 1090| [45] ["No, you see... if -I- said it, that boy would surely oppose it..."]
 72: 1095| [47] [Mashiro]
 73: 1098| [45] ["... I guess you're right."]
 74: 1103| [45] [Mashiro smiled wryly as she looked at the professor's lack of confidence.]
 75: 1108| [45] [Something amused Mashiro about how this awkward mother had trouble approaching her son.]
 76: 1113| [45] [It was somehow charming how the professor never openly showed how much she cared for her son and resorted to taking secretive measures like this one.]
 77: 1139| [47] [Miyoko]
 78: 1142| [45] ["Now, I'm sure those two will be a little uneasy just by themselves, so I want you to help bring them together... Can I count on you?"]
 79: 1147| [47] [Mashiro]
 80: 1150| [45] ["Understood. I'll help out in any way I can."]
 81: 1176| [47] [Miyoko]
 82: 1179| [45] ["Ahh... thank you, Mashiro."]
 83: 1205| [47] [Miyoko]
 84: 1208| [45] ["I'm sorry for troubling you about Natsuhiko all the time."]
 85: 1213| [47] [Mashiro]
 86: 1216| [45] ["True, he can be a little difficult at times~..."]
 87: 1221| [47] [Mashiro]
 88: 1224| [45] ["But I don't mind at all. I look out for him because I enjoy it."]
 89: 1229| [45] [After Mashiro finished, the professor paused for a moment before asking another question.]
 90: 1255| [47] [Miyoko]
 91: 1258| [45] ["... Excuse me, Mashiro. I've always been wondering, but..."]
 92: 1266| [47] [Miyoko]
 93: 1269| [45] ["Why do you go so far for Natsuhiko's sake?"]
 94: 1274| [47] [Mashiro]
 95: 1277| [45] ["Why, you ask...?"]
 96: 1282| [45] [Mashiro smiled wryly and sighed a bit.]
 97: 1287| [47] [Mashiro]
 98: 1290| [45] ["... I guess Natsuhiko had to have gotten his denseness from somewhere, huh, Professor?"]
 99: 1317| [47] [Miyoko]
100: 1320| [45] ["Huh?"]
101: 1325| [47] [Mashiro]
102: 1328| [45] ["Professor. You see, I--"]
103: 1333| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1336| [45] ["I think I really love Natsuhiko."]
105: 1350| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 1353| [45] ["..."]
107: 1358| [45] [The professor's eyes widened at that answer.]
108: 1366| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1369| [45] ["W-well..."]
110: 1395| [47] [Miyoko]
111: 1398| [45] ["You mean... as a man?"]
112: 1403| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1406| [45] ["Hmm, I wonder?"]
114: 1411| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 1414| [45] ["Well, for now, as a 'good friend', I guess."]
116: 1440| [47] [Miyoko]
117: 1443| [45] ["Yes... I see."]
118: 1448| [45] [The professor muttered that and smiled somewhat sadly.]
119: 1545| [45] [--What Mashiro said to the professor, she probably could not say to the boy in question.]
120: 1550| [45] [Mashiro thought she'd continue to keep those feelings to herself.]
121: 1556| [45] [Until the day came when the time was right...]
