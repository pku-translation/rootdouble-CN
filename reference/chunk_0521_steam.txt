  0:    1| [55] [Tutorial]
  1:   50| [45] [We apologize for interrupting you so early on, but there are no "choices" in this world.]
  2:   55| [45] [Regardless, we need your power to link this world to the future.]
  3:   60| [45] [So the Senses Sympathy System (SSS) has been prepared in order to allow you to willingly influence the world.]
  4:   65| [45] [This tutorial will explain the SSS to you--]
  5:   70| [45] [But before that, let's explain what we mean by "Senses" here.]
  6:   75| [45] [Senses refers to "impressions, emotions, sensations" in this context. Put it simply, its your assessment of "how you feel" about someone else.]
  7:   80| [45] [In other words, if their Senses are high, you have a "good impression" of that person--]
  8:   85| [45] [But on the other hand, if their Senses are low, that means you have a "bad impression" of that person.]
  9:   90| [45] [And the Senses Sympathy System exists to quantify your Senses and reflect them on this world.]
 10:   95| [45] [Now then, let's explain how to change the value of your Senses.]
 11:  139| [45] [In specific scenes, a graphic that looks like a magic seal will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This is known as an "Enneagram".]
 12:  144| [45] [An enneagram is a kind of personality assessor that categorizes people into nine different personality types.]
 13:  149| [45] [Each of the nine main characters of this story have been categorized into these nine types.]
 14:  193| [45] [Thus, the nine characters have been distributed onto the nine points of the Enneagram.]
 15:  198| [45] [A graph similar to a radar chart is displayed on top of the Enneagram.]
 16:  203| [45] [This graph is a symbol that represents Senses.]
 17:  247| [45] [The shape of the graph corresponds to the nine characters, and its shape will change as you alter their Senses.]
 18:  252| [45] [You can input the Senses of nine characters, which includes the protagonist. Thus, in a sense, you may also set the Senses you have for "yourself".]
 19:  257| [45] [In such an instance, you determine whether or not you have confidence in your instincts and opinions...]
 20:  262| [45] [Alternatively, you determine how much you value yourself.]
 21:  267| [45] [Senses Sympathy System.]
 22:  272| [45] [Truly a system where you determine the protagonist's various sensations/Senses each time.]
 23:  277| [45] [Your Senses will be used to determine which scenario divergence you will travel down at fixed "divergence points".]
 24:  282| [45] [At divergence points, the story automatically diverges in accordance to the level of your Senses.]
 25:  326| [45] [You can't simply input your Senses whenever you want.]
 26:  331| [45] [You can only do that at sections known as "branches".]
 27:  336| [45] [When you arrive at a branch, the Enneagram will appear in the upper-right hand corner.]
 28:  341| [45] [Please check if the Enneagram is displaying or not to determine when you can and can't input your Senses.]
 29:  346| [45] [Allow us to explain in detail through example.]
 30:  389| [45] [Let's play a demo scenario branch while you actually control the system.]
 31:  394| [45] [First, please take a look at the next scene. The Senses input hasn't appeared yet, so please just play through the text as you normally would.]
 32:  533| [45] [In a certain boy's house--]
 33:  538| [45] [A TV and a game console were sitting in a neat and tidy living room.]
 34:  543| [45] [Just then, a girl came down from the hallway and spoke in an inquisitive voice.]
 35:  551| [47] [Girl]
 36:  554| [45] ["Hey, what're you doing?"]
 37:  562| [47] [Girl]
 38:  565| [45] ["... Huh? You're playing a game tutorial?"]
 39:  573| [47] [Girl]
 40:  576| [45] ["Is it really important...?"]
 41:  584| [47] [Girl]
 42:  587| [45] ["I see. You must be real busy, huh...?"]
 43:  595| [47] [Girl]
 44:  598| [45] ["Um, actually, I wanted to talk to you about something... but this is a bad time, isn't it?"]
 45:  603| [45] [The girl looked at you hopefully as she said that.]
 46:  611| [47] [Girl]
 47:  614| [45] ["Oh... I'm sorry. It looks like I'm just bothering you, so I'll ask you later."]
 48:  622| [47] [Girl]
 49:  625| [45] ["--No, don't worry about it. It wasn't all that important."]
 50:  633| [47] [Girl]
 51:  636| [45] ["Okay then, good luck with that game tutorial..."]
 52:  641| [45] [The girl slumped her shoulders with disappointment--]
 53:  646| [45] [--and she left the living room with a lonely step in her gait.]
 54:  749| [45] [This was an example of an occasion where your Senses for that girl were low.]
 55:  754| [45] [Now then, let's play that scene one more time, with the goal this time being to make the girl "happy".]
 56:  759| [45] [There'll be a branch this time, so you can input your Senses there.]
 57:  764| [45] [When you arrive at a branch, the Enneagram will appear in the upper-right hand corner.]
 58:  769| [45] [Please increase your Senses for the girl before the Enneagram disappears.]
 59:  774| [45] [When the Senses lights up, please click it to bring up the Senses input screen. You can also bring up the input screen by pressing the [V] button.]
 60:  818| [45] [When you click the Senses, you will arrive at this screen. This is the Senses input screen.]
 61:  823| [45] [Use the cursor to choose whose Senses you'd like to change, bring it to the knob directly below them, then change their Senses.]
 62:  828| [45] [Click the "Decide" button to set your values and to finish the input process.]
 63:  833| [45] [You can only do a Senses input one time per branch.]
 64:  838| [45] [You can't input again if you change your mind after you've decided, so please be careful.]
 65: 1025| [47] [Girl]
 66: 1028| [45] ["Hey, what're you doing?"]
 67: 1036| [47] [Girl]
 68: 1039| [45] ["... Huh? You're playing a game tutorial?"]
 69: 1093| [47] [Girl]
 70: 1096| [45] ["Is it really important...?"]
 71: 1104| [47] [Girl]
 72: 1107| [45] ["I see. You must be real busy, huh...?"]
 73: 1115| [47] [Girl]
 74: 1118| [45] ["Um, actually, I wanted to talk to you about something... but this is a bad time, isn't it?"]
 75: 1123| [45] [The girl looked at you hopefully as she said that.]
 76: 1128| [45] [So you--]
 77: 1144| [47] [Girl]
 78: 1147| [45] ["Huh? You'll listen? Really? Is that okay?"]
 79: 1155| [47] [Girl]
 80: 1158| [45] ["Yaay, thank you!"]
 81: 1166| [47] [Girl]
 82: 1169| [45] ["Well you see, you see, today's a holiday known as 'Tanabata'!"]
 83: 1177| [47] [Girl]
 84: 1180| [45] ["And you know, if you write your wish on a strip of paper called a 'tanzaku' today, it'll be granted!"]
 85: 1188| [47] [Girl]
 86: 1191| [45] ["So I was thinking that we need to make preparations for it right now!"]
 87: 1196| [45] [The girl then started talking happily about the bamboo trees that are set up on Tanabata--]
 88: 1207| [47] [Girl]
 89: 1210| [45] ["Oh... I'm sorry. It looks like I'm just bothering you, so I'll ask you later."]
 90: 1218| [47] [Girl]
 91: 1221| [45] ["--No, don't worry about it. It wasn't all that important."]
 92: 1229| [47] [Girl]
 93: 1232| [45] ["Okay then, good luck with that game tutorial..."]
 94: 1237| [45] [The girl slumped her shoulders with disappointment--]
 95: 1242| [45] [--and she left the living room with a lonely step in her gait.]
 96: 1345| [45] [Unfortunately, the girl's reaction did not change.]
 97: 1350| [45] [Please repeat this scene one more time and use the Senses Sympathy System.]
 98: 1355| [45] [Raise your Senses for the girl as high as you can before the input prompt disappears.]
 99: 1466| [45] [Congratulations. You have successfully raised the girl's favor.]
100: 1471| [45] [In this example, the girl had two different reactions, but there may be more than that depending on the situation.]
101: 1476| [45] [Also, there isn't always just one Senses target.]
102: 1481| [45] [If there is ever more than one target that you need to take into consideration, you'll have to re-evaluate your Senses for them individually.]
103: 1486| [45] [In these situations, you can input for more than one character.]
104: 1491| [45] [But the only ones whose Senses you can input are those who are involved with the next branch. You cannot alter the Senses for an unrelated character.]
105: 1496| [45] [There will occasionally be times where Senses hold a greater importance than usual.]
106: 1501| [45] [As such, there are three different Senses colors, each one corresponding to the importance of the upcoming branch.]
107: 1545| [45] [Blue: this signifies an event where you can probably influence a target's favor.]
108: 1550| [45] [A "blue branch", as it's known, is generally not all that important.]
109: 1555| [45] [You don't even need to change your Senses every time it comes up.]
110: 1560| [45] [All you have to do is change it whenever your impression of the target alters.]
111: 1565| [45] [But if you neglect too many blue branches, it could have dire consequences for you farther down the line.]
112: 1609| [45] [Yellow: this generally signifies an event where you can probably influence someone's actions.]
113: 1614| [45] [A "yellow branch", as it's known, is generally very important.]
114: 1619| [45] [Expect them to signify big changes, such as changing your destination or travel partner.]
115: 1624| [45] [They're not dangerous, but it's best that you change your Senses to reflect your intentions at these points.]
116: 1629| [45] [And though it's rare, a yellow branch can signify that a branch of "grave danger" is approaching, so please be careful.]
117: 1673| [45] [Red: this signifies "grave danger".]
118: 1678| [45] [A "red branch", as it's known, is of the utmost importance.]
119: 1683| [45] [Decide incorrectly and you will find death lying in wait for you.]
120: 1688| [45] [Keep your eyes peeled to avoid danger and please check your Senses immediately to ensure there are no problems.]
121: 1693| [45] [Also, branches directly related to the story's "conclusion" will be red.]
122: 1698| [45] [We recommend you exercise cautious judgment there in the same way.]
123: 1741| [45] [This concludes the Senses Sympathy System explanation.]
124: 1746| [45] [Your Senses will change the situation in various ways.]
125: 1751| [45] [Now then, let us return to the world.]
126: 1756| [45] [When time starts again, a Senses input will appear right away.]
127: 1802| [45] [The Enneagram will be glowing yellow--]
128: 1807| [45] [This indicates that a branch of great danger is coming up.]
129: 1812| [45] [Should you choose wrongly, death may soon claim the man.]
130: 1817| [45] [Please look over the situation calmly and select your Senses right away.]
131: 1862| [45] [The Enneagram will be glowing blue.]
132: 1867| [45] [However, the girls' favor towards the boy is very important to him.]
133: 1872| [45] [A tragic result may be awaiting in the worst-case scenario.]
134: 1877| [45] [Please look over the situation calmly and select your Senses carefully.]
135: 1883| [45] [We are expecting your feelings to have a good effect on this world.]
