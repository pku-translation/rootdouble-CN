  1:  115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:  118| [45] ["Mmm..."]
  3:  123| [45] [Natsuhiko woke up.]
  4:  128| [45] [His vision and consciousness were still blurry.]
  5:  138| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  139| [45] [(Huh, where am I...?)]
  7:  190| [45] [His unfamiliar surroundings had him on the verge of a confused panic, but--]
  8:  199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  200| [45] [(That's right. Last night I called Yuuri on the phone and then I returned to the karaoke box...)]
 10:  205| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  206| [45] [(Guess I passed out from exhaustion right after that...)]
 12:  348| [45] [After a moment, his thoughts managed to clear themselves again.]
 13:  353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  354| [45] [(How are the other two...?)]
 15:  377| [45] [Natsuhiko turned his head to look for Mashiro--]
 16:  465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  466| [45] ["!"]
 18:  471| [45] [--only to find her face right beside him.]
 19:  476| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  477| [45] [(She's too close! And she looks way too defenseless!)]
 21:  482| [45] [He only barely kept himself from shouting in surprise.]
 22:  487| [45] [Just afterward, Mashiro opened her eyes ever so slightly--]
 23:  540| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  543| [45] ["... Mmm."]
 25:  558| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  561| [45] ["!?"]
 27:  566| [45] [Her eyes were fixing on Natsuhiko in an enraptured gaze.]
 28:  578| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  579| [45] ["..."]
 30:  584| [45] [The sight of her awakening was so enthralling, it left him speechless.]
 31:  589| [45] [It was a side of his childhood friend that he had never seen before.]
 32:  594| [45] [But after only a moment had passed--]
 33:  642| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  645| [45] ["... Huh... AGH!? N-Natsuhiko!?"]
 35:  650| [45] [--she returned to the usual Mashiro.]
 36:  707| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  710| [45] ["Ah, I-I'm sorry!"]
 38:  715| [45] [Natsuhiko jumped away reflexively--]
 39:  729| [45] [He stood up as he looked around the room--]
 40:  755| [45] [--and suddenly felt himself step on something soft.]
 41:  769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  772| [45] ["Ah..."]
 43:  777| [45] [Looking down, he found Salyu sleeping on the floor. He had accidentally stepped on her.]
 44:  782| [45] [She seemed to be sleeping peacefully, but--]
 45:  825| [47] [Salyu]
 46:  828| [45] ["!"]
 47:  833| [45] [--not a moment later, Salyu grabbed his foot,]
 48:  944| [47] [Salyu]
 49:  947| [45] ["Shah!!"]
 50:  975| [45] [and flung him away in a flash.]
 51:  991| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  994| [45] ["Uwaaah!"]
 53:  999| [45] [Natsuhiko's world turned upside down as he toppled onto the floor.]
 54: 1046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1049| [45] ["Ow ow ow..."]
 56: 1075| [47] [Salyu]
 57: 1078| [45] ["Ah... Natsuhiko."]
 58: 1083| [45] [As part of her reactive throwing motion, Salyu had risen to her feet.]
 59: 1115| [45] [Mashiro woke up at the sound of the commotion.]
 60: 1123| [47] [Mashiro]
 61: 1126| [45] ["Mm... what's the ruckus so early in the morning...?"]
 62: 1152| [47] [Salyu]
 63: 1155| [45] ["I thought Natsuhiko was going to attack me in my sleep, so I unleashed a 'Sannomiya Screw' leg whip on him by reflex."]
 64: 1161| [45] [She appeared to have come back to her senses as she lent him her hand.]
 65: 1187| [47] [Salyu]
 66: 1190| [45] ["I'm sorry. I thought you were going to attack me in my sleep, so I unleashed a 'Sannomiya Screw' leg whip on you by reflex."]
 67: 1198| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1201| [45] ["A Sannomiya Screw...?"]
 69: 1206| [45] [Natsuhiko groaned as he got up. His knees and back ached.]
 70: 1211| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1212| [45] [(So she can use more than just aikido...?)]
 72: 1217| [45] [That was not an aikido technique no matter how he looked at it.]
 73: 1249| [45] [Mashiro rubbed her half-asleep eyes as she asked about it too.]
 74: 1275| [47] [Mashiro]
 75: 1278| [45] ["Is that a Salyu-original special move?"]
 76: 1305| [47] [Salyu]
 77: 1308| [45] ["Yes. It's a technique from the composite system of martial arts I created by mixing several styles of hand-to-hand combat-- 'Sannomiya Style Savate'."]
 78: 1316| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1319| [45] ["Other techniques include the 'Sannomiya Sleeper', the 'Sannomiya Rocket', and the 'Sannomiya Suplex'."]
 80: 1327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1330| [45] ["... I see."]
 82: 1356| [47] [Mashiro]
 83: 1359| [45] ["Those don't sound like savate techniques to me. And I get the feeling I've heard those names somewhere before."]
 84: 1415| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1418| [45] ["Forget about the techniques. What time is it?"]
 86: 1423| [45] [Natsuhiko checked his watch.]
 87: 1437| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1440| [45] ["Umm... 7:12 AM, I guess?"]
 89: 1445| [45] [It was relatively early for a Sunday morning. But they had business to take care of today.]
 90: 1450| [45] [Natsuhiko took a deep breath before speaking.]
 91: 1458| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1461| [45] ["Now then... today we'll begin a full-blown search for the terrorists."]
 93: 1505| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1508| [45] ["Awrighty, I'm ready to go when you are!"]
 95: 1534| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1537| [45] ["We shouldn't overstay our visit here. We should set our sights and move."]
 97: 1545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1548| [45] ["Okay, so let's think then. What exactly is it that we should do?"]
 99: 1574| [47] [Salyu]
100: 1577| [45] ["That should be obvious. Our end goal is 'to stop the terrorist plot'. And to do that, we should 'clear our names with the security department' if possible."]
101: 1585| [47] [Salyu]
102: 1588| [45] ["To clear our names with the security department, I believe we need to find that security guard and make him admit to falsifying his report."]
103: 1596| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1599| [45] ["I see, that does sound logical..."]
105: 1604| [45] [After Natsuhiko nodded in consent, Mashiro was next to speak.]
106: 1648| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1651| [45] ["Ah, I've got a suggestion too!"]
108: 1659| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1662| [45] ["What's up, Mashiro?"]
110: 1688| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1691| [45] ["While we work on that front, shouldn't we also search for the man who was on the bus?"]
112: 1699| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1702| [45] ["I said it before, but even though he was concealing his face with sunglasses, I think I'll know him when I see him."]
114: 1710| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 1713| [45] ["If we happen to find him, we just need to tie him up real quick and hand him over to the police."]
116: 1721| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1724| [45] ["Hmm, that sounds easier said than done, though..."]
118: 1750| [47] [Salyu]
119: 1753| [45] ["Besides, if he's a terrorist, it's only natural that he'd have comrades. I don't think the arrest of one man will prevent a terrorist attack."]
120: 1761| [47] [Mashiro]
121: 1764| [45] ["But it would stop the security department from suspecting us and it'd force the police to start searching too, wouldn't it?"]
122: 1790| [47] [Salyu]
123: 1793| [45] ["I see. That indeed does have merit to it."]
124: 1837| [47] [Mashiro]
125: 1840| [45] ["I know, right?"]
126: 1845| [45] [Natsuhiko more or less agreed with that opinion, but--]
127: 1853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1856| [45] ["... But don't you think we'd be banking too much on a coincidence to happen?"]
129: 1864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1867| [45] ["Wouldn't it be important to gain some adult cooperation first?"]
131: 1893| [47] [Mashiro]
132: 1896| [45] ["Huh? But the security department's already suspicious of us."]
133: 1904| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1907| [45] ["No, that's exactly why we need help from an adult. An adult we can trust."]
135: 1915| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1918| [45] ["They might be able to help talk us out of the misunderstanding with the security department, and we could rely on them when the going gets tough."]
137: 1923| [45] [It would've been a different story if Natsuhiko were the only one at risk for danger, but he wanted to ensure Mashiro and Salyu were as safe as possible.]
138: 1931| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1934| [45] ["There are two adults I have in mind. The first is Mr. Ukita. The second is Prof. Tsubakiyama."]
140: 1960| [47] [Mashiro]
141: 1963| [45] ["Yeah, those two do seem like they'd hear us out, don't they?"]
142: 1989| [47] [Salyu]
143: 1992| [45] ["It's difficult for me to judge who to trust..."]
144: 2000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2003| [45] ["Actually... I think Mashiro should be the judge of who we can trust or not."]
146: 2029| [47] [Mashiro]
147: 2032| [45] ["Huh? Me? Why?"]
148: 2037| [45] [Natsuhiko meekly responded to Mashiro's puzzled glance.]
149: 2045| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2048| [45] ["You can use empathy, can't you, Mashiro?"]
151: 2074| [47] [Mashiro]
152: 2077| [45] ["... Yeah."]
153: 2131| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2134| [45] ["And empathy can only be used on someone who's opened their heart to you, right?"]
155: 2142| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2145| [45] ["So if there's anybody who acts or looks suspicious, can't you just check to see if you can use empathy on them?"]
157: 2171| [47] [Mashiro]
158: 2174| [45] ["Huh...? But that's...!"]
159: 2179| [45] [Mashiro's expression clouded over.]
160: 2184| [45] [She was probably reluctant to peek into other people's minds.]
161: 2248| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 2249| [45] [(... I know a lot of people hate having their minds peeped into... but I guess it goes both ways, huh.)]
163: 2254| [45] [When Mashiro first became able to use empathy and she tried peeking into someone's mind to make sure--]
164: 2259| [45] [--perhaps it left her with a bad experience.]
165: 2264| [45] [From an objective viewpoint, Mashiro had quite attractive looks, and she was even popular among the boys at school.]
166: 2269| [45] [There must've been at least a few men who harbored a certain kind of lust for her as well.]
167: 2274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2275| [45] [(... If she came face to face with the bare monstrosity of a man's mind, then it's only natural it'd leave a bad memory.)]
169: 2280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2281| [45] [(That could be why she prohibited herself from peeking into other people's minds...)]
171: 2286| [45] [Natsuhiko realized how unreasonable he was being with his request.]
172: 2307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2310| [45] ["... No, I'm sorry. We really shouldn't, Mashiro."]
174: 2336| [47] [Mashiro]
175: 2339| [45] ["Huh?"]
176: 2347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2350| [45] ["I really shouldn't force you do something against your morals..."]
178: 2376| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 2379| [45] ["N-not at all! It's okay!"]
180: 2405| [47] [Mashiro]
181: 2408| [45] ["I'm the one who suggested this whole thing, after all. If an absolute need arises, I can act against my moral code if I have to."]
182: 2413| [45] [That answer only made Natsuhiko feel more guilty.]
183: 2424| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2427| [45] ["... Of course, if you feel uncomfortable about it, just tell me."]
185: 2435| [47] [Natsuhiko]
186: 2438| [45] ["I won't force you..."]
187: 2464| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 2467| [45] ["N-not at all! It's okay... If an absolute need arises, I can act against my moral code if I have to."]
189: 2472| [45] [Mashiro hesitantly gave her answer.]
190: 2480| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 2483| [45] ["I'm sorry, Mashiro..."]
192: 2509| [47] [Mashiro]
193: 2512| [45] ["It's fine, it's fine. We're in a state of emergency, after all."]
194: 2520| [47] [Mashiro]
195: 2523| [45] ["Now that I have this ability, I may as well put it to good use for once."]
196: 2528| [45] [Mashiro spoke in a bright voice.]
197: 2533| [45] [Even if it were mere bravado, it provided relief to Natsuhiko and Salyu.]
198: 2541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 2544| [45] ["Okay, looks like we've made up our minds on what to do, then...!"]
200: 2570| [47] [Mashiro]
201: 2573| [45] ["Yeah. 'Clear our names with the security department.'%N'Search for terrorists.'%N'Acquire adult cooperation.'"]
202: 2581| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 2584| [45] ["All while avoiding surveillance cameras and the security department, too...!"]
204: 2610| [47] [Mashiro]
205: 2613| [45] ["And yet we've still gotta do it. It's not easy being an ally of justice, huh."]
206: 2621| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 2624| [45] ["Ready guys? I'm ready when you are."]
208: 2632| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2635| [45] ["Yeah. Those are some stiff conditions to meet, but let's give it a go."]
210: 2661| [47] [Salyu]
211: 2664| [45] ["... Let's all work hard together."]
212: 2669| [45] [The three of them nodded at each other and Natsuhiko spoke.]
213: 2677| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2680| [45] ["All right! Then let's get to work on the double!"]
215: 2724| [47] [Mashiro]
216: 2727| [45] ["Yeah!"]
217: 2753| [47] [Salyu]
218: 2756| [45] ["Roger."]
219: 2761| [45] [And with that, the three of them exchanged firm handshakes.]
