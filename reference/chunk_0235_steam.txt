  1:   74| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   75| [45] [(--...)]
  3:   80| [45] [Before he knew it, Natsuhiko was in LABO.]
  4:  159| [45] [Yuuri and Mashiro were at his side.]
  5:  164| [45] [The sight of Mashiro shedding tears jogged Natsuhiko's memory about the present situation.]
  6:  169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  170| [45] [(Oh yeah, right now...!)]
  8:  175| [45] [They were surrounded on both sides by fires on their way from Area 4 to Area 5.]
  9:  180| [45] [The end of the passageway was covered in fire.]
 10:  185| [45] [Even if they turned around and went back to Area 4, there were fires blazing there too.]
 11:  190| [45] [They were caught between a fire and a hot place.]
 12:  195| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  196| [45] [(Gh... wh-what do we do!?)]
 14:  201| [45] [He couldn't come up with a plan.]
 15:  206| [45] [But time kept ticking down.]
 16:  214| [47] [Yuuri]
 17:  217| [45] ["H-Hikorin...!"]
 18:  222| [45] [Yuuri tugged at Natsuhiko's sleeve and pleaded anxiously.]
 19:  230| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  233| [45] ["It's too dangerous for us to stay here any longer...!"]
 21:  241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  244| [45] ["... N-no, wait. Yuuri."]
 23:  270| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  273| [45] ["Huh?"]
 25:  281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  284| [45] ["We can't go forward or back here... so..."]
 27:  292| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  295| [45] ["Let's just wait for rescue here..."]
 29:  321| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  324| [45] ["For rescue...!? Will anybody even come?"]
 31:  329| [45] [Yuuri's tone was negative.]
 32:  334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  335| [45] ["..."]
 34:  340| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't think.]
 35:  472| [45] [Time ticked by all the more.]
 36:  477| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at his watch, and although it was supposed to be broken, it had suddenly started ticking down time again.]
 37:  521| [45] [But the date was off as it displayed "9/14".]
 38:  526| [45] [Natsuhiko was perturbed by the sight.]
 39:  531| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  532| [45] [(I thought I had overcome the past that day...)]
 41:  537| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  538| [45] [(But in the end, did I overcome nothing at all...?)]
 43:  547| [45] [--Eventually, smoke drifted in from the other side of the passageway.]
 44:  552| [45] [Mashiro muttered soon enough.]
 45:  575| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  578| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko."]
 47:  586| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  589| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 49:  597| [47] [Mashiro]
 50:  600| [45] ["To be honest, this is starting to look kinda bad..."]
 51:  605| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  606| [45] ["..."]
 53:  611| [45] [As Natsuhiko sunk into silence, the expression on his face must've been one of extreme depression.]
 54:  616| [45] [Mashiro gently took his hand.]
 55:  624| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  627| [45] ["... This might be our last chance... so there's something I want to tell you."]
 57:  635| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  638| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 59:  661| [47] [Mashiro]
 60:  664| [45] ["Um... it's about the day before yesterday..."]
 61:  672| [47] [Mashiro]
 62:  675| [45] ["You believed me and helped me look for the terrorists, right?"]
 63:  683| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  686| [45] ["You forgave me for deceiving you about me being unable to use empathy, right?"]
 65:  694| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  697| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 67:  720| [47] [Mashiro]
 68:  723| [45] ["... You made me so happy."]
 69:  731| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  734| [45] ["... Thank you, Natsuhiko."]
 71:  739| [45] [Natsuhiko felt his heart twist at those words.]
 72:  744| [45] [Mashiro spoke those words as if they were her last--]
 73:  752| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74:  755| [45] ["...!"]
 75:  760| [45] [Natsuhiko squeezed Mashiro's hand back.]
 76:  765| [45] [More and more smoke filled the passageway. The ambient temperature rose.]
 77:  770| [45] [Eventually, Yuuri muttered sorrowfully.]
 78:  796| [47] [Yuuri]
 79:  799| [45] ["... Hikorin..."]
 80:  807| [47] [Yuuri]
 81:  810| [45] ["I don't want it to end like this..."]
 82:  815| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83:  816| [45] ["..."]
 84:  824| [47] [Yuuri]
 85:  827| [45] ["I thought you'd look for the correct path..."]
 86:  835| [47] [Yuuri]
 87:  838| [45] ["I thought you'd join hands with the others and overcome reality...!"]
 88:  846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89:  849| [45] ["... I'm sorry."]
 90:  854| [45] [Natsuhiko held Yuuri's hand too.]
 91:  898| [45] [The three of them stood there, hand in hand.]
 92:  903| [45] [--For who knew how long.]
 93:  957| [45] [Eventually they spotted fire at the other side of the passageway.]
 94:  965| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95:  968| [45] ["...!"]
 96: 1015| [45] [The fire drew closer.]
 97: 1061| [45] [The fire drew closer.]
 98: 1106| [45] [The fire drew closer.]
 99: 1111| [45] [--Natsuhiko grasped Yuuri's and Mashiro's hands tightly and watched the fire flicker...]

105: 1195| [45] [--Eventually, in the deep depths of his fading consciousness--]
106: 1200| [45] ["Awake", a voice called to him.]
107: 1205| [45] [Or perhaps it was merely a memory of such a voice.]
108: 1210| [45] [The moment he heard that voice...]
109: 1215| [45] [Time returned to that day once more.]
