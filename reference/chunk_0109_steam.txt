  1:    5| [45] [But the only way it'd be within the safety standard for them was with AD.]
  2:   10| [45] [If they didn't find any soon, all of LABO would probably turn into a contaminated zone for them.]
  3:   15| [45] [That hopeless situation was the one thing they wanted to avoid at all costs.]
  4:   23| [47] [Watase]
  5:   26| [45] ["There's only 30 minutes left until the effects of the AD run out. Let's split up and look for some."]
  6:   54| [47] [Ukita]
  7:   57| [45] ["Which means we should make the factory our focal point for the search, correct?"]
  8:   65| [47] [Ukita]
  9:   68| [45] ["This is where they supposedly make the AD, so some of it might have survived the fire."]
 10:   73| [45] [Come to think of it, Kazami had mentioned a while back that AD had been given to them by LABO staff members.]
 11:   99| [47] [Ena]
 12:  102| [45] ["But won't trying to find one of those in this wreck be like trying to find a needle in a haystack?"]
 13:  128| [47] [Jun]
 14:  131| [45] ["True. And we've gotta search the inner ring from head to toe as well."]
 15:  136| [45] [They didn't have time to keep discussing the matter, so Watase instantly made a decision.]
 16:  144| [47] [Watase]
 17:  147| [45] ["Got it, then I'll search the inner ring by myself. Everyone else will check the factory."]
 18:  152| [45] [Watase said that and headed off to the inner ring by himself.]
 19:  250| [45] [--He ran as fast as he could through the block on B2.]
 20:  385| [45] [But he couldn't find any AD no matter how many rooms he searched.]
 21:  390| [47] [Watase]
 22:  391| [45] [(--No, calm down. You still haven't checked B1 yet.)]
 23:  439| [45] [Watase headed for the stairwell so he could go up.]
 24:  451| [45] [He opened the fireproof door--]
 25:  580| [45] [--and saw the totally collapsed emergency staircase lying in front of him.]
 26:  585| [47] [Watase]
 27:  586| [45] [(Dammit, we don't have time for this!)]
 28:  598| [45] [His watch said "11:58 AM"--]
 29:  603| [45] [Only 20 minutes were left until the AD wore off.]
 30:  608| [47] [Watase]
 31:  609| [45] [(Do I have to go back up an elevator shaft again?)]
 32:  614| [47] [Watase]
 33:  615| [45] [(No--)]
 34:  620| [45] [Watase took out the 10 meter rope he'd been carrying this whole time and tied the end to the debris lying on the ground.]
 35:  631| [45] [He then tossed it up, and it caught on the handrail of the still intact landing of B1.]
 36:  694| [45] [He tugged it several times to test its strength, but it appeared that the rope was firmly secure.]
 37:  699| [47] [Watase]
 38:  700| [45] [(--Okay, here I go!)]
 39:  787| [45] [He climbed up the thick rope with his brute strength and safely made it up to B1.]
 40:  792| [47] [Watase]
 41:  793| [45] [(Tch, I wasted too much time...)]
 42:  798| [45] [Watase cursed himself and ran off again to begin the search anew.]
 43:  852| [45] [But his searched ended without yielding anything--]
 44:  897| [45] [By the time he got back down to B2, Watase's gait had become quite heavy.]
 45:  902| [47] [Watase]
 46:  903| [45] [(I hope Tachibana and the others found AD...)]
 47:  908| [45] [Watase ran through the connecting passageway to the factory with anxiety in his heart--%Nbut just then...]
 48:  937| [47] [Watase]
 49:  940| [45] ["!!!???"]
 50:  945| [45] [Watase shuddered at the roar that'd come from straight ahead.]
 51: 1004| [45] [He hurried on over into the factory, quickly spotting a cloud of dust rising from a corner.]
 52: 1009| [45] [Kazami and the others were surrounding it.]
 53: 1017| [47] [Watase]
 54: 1020| [45] ["What's wrong!? What happened!?"]
 55: 1025| [45] [He ran over to the group to find everyone, including Kazami, staring at a pile of debris that stood in the middle of the dust.]
 56: 1030| [45] [No one paid any heed to Watase's question-- none of them even reacted to him.]
 57: 1038| [47] [Watase]
 58: 1041| [45] ["Hey, Tachibana! Tell me what happened!"]
 59: 1046| [45] [Just then, Kazami answered in an absentminded voice.]
 60: 1074| [47] [Kazami]
 61: 1077| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri's... by the time we noticed, it was too late..."]
 62: 1082| [45] [Watase looked down at the debris to find a giant pool of blood seeping out from under it.]
 63: 1087| [45] [It then finally hit him that Yuuri was not among the "four" people there.]
 64: 1114| [47] [Jun]
 65: 1117| [45] ["*sob*... Yuuri... Yuuri..."]
 66: 1171| [47] [Ukita]
 67: 1174| [45] ["Why... why did something like this happen...?"]
 68: 1201| [47] [Ena]
 69: 1204| [45] ["We got so caught up in looking for AD that we..."]
 70: 1258| [47] [Kazami]
 71: 1261| [45] ["I... I should have noticed it was dangerous..."]
 72: 1266| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1267| [45] [(N-no, no, this isn't for real, is it...?)]
 74: 1272| [45] [But as soon as he understood the situation, something in Watase snapped, and he ran over to the bottom of the debris.]
 75: 1321| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1324| [45] ["Yuuri! Please, Yuuri, answer me!"]
 77: 1332| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1335| [45] ["--You dumbasses! What the hell are you all standing there for!? Help me save Yuuri!"]
 79: 1340| [45] [It was then that Jun, the one who'd normally be in Watase's shoes at the moment, spoke sadly.]
 80: 1373| [47] [Jun]
 81: 1376| [45] ["It's hopeless, Captain... that huge pile of rubble came falling from the ceiling..."]
 82: 1384| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1387| [45] ["Yuuri was right under it... so..."]
 84: 1392| [45] [Jun's words painted out her sobs.]
 85: 1400| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1403| [45] ["N-no... dammit-- DAMMIIIIIIIIIIIT!"]
 87: 1408| [45] [The group then just stood where they were for what felt like an eternity.]
 88: 1413| [45] [Eventually, Kazami's watch alarm went off.]
 89: 1472| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1475| [45] ["Did you find any AD...?"]
 91: 1481| [45] [Kazami silently shook her head.]
 92: 1486| [45] [It was then that the Procyon began to beep.]
 93: 1497| [45] [The reading was now precisely at "4000 mSv"--]
 94: 1502| [45] [Watase's skin quickly started growing numb, and his head began aching.]
 95: 1511| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1514| [45] ["Let's go... we're all done for if we stay here."]
 97: 1522| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1525| [45] ["Let's go find AD first. Besides, we still have to find Natsuhiko and his friends."]
 99: 1570| [45] [The group then started searching the facility all over again starting from Area 1.]
100: 1614| [45] [Watase's skin felt strange, nausea took hold of him, and his headache grew worse and worse...]
101: 1619| [45] [It wasn't long before even his pace gradually grew weak.]
102: 1624| [45] [Despite that, the group had to keep wandering the facility to find AD and the survivors.]
103: 1629| [45] [Eventually, they noticed Ukita was gone.]
104: 1637| [47] [Watase]
105: 1640| [45] ["Hey... where'd... the old man go...?"]
106: 1645| [45] [His head hurt so much that even thinking was a Herculean task for him.]
107: 1650| [45] [But it appeared that it was the same for everyone else.]
108: 1678| [47] [Kazami]
109: 1681| [45] ["That's odd... He was with us... just a few minutes ago, wasn't he...?"]
110: 1708| [47] [Jun]
111: 1711| [45] ["Yeah... he was there... a short while ago... right... Ms. Tsubakiyama...?"]
112: 1716| [45] [Ena didn't answer Jun's question.]
113: 1724| [47] [Watase]
114: 1727| [45] ["Teach...?"]
115: 1815| [47] [Ena]
116: 1818| [45] ["..."]
117: 1925| [45] [Watase carried the now unconscious Ena and headed for Area 2 this time.]
118: 1930| [45] [His nausea was so bad that he couldn't even open his mouth.]
119: 1958| [47] [Jun]
120: 1961| [45] ["Hey... we'll fiiind that A... AD for suure thiis time, riiight...?"]
121: 1966| [45] [Jun's speech was now considerably slurred.]
122: 2042| [45] [She passed out while they were searching Area 2.]
123: 2047| [45] [Kazami carried her on her back and spoke.]
124: 2073| [47] [Kazami]
125: 2076| [45] ["Captain... at this rate, we'll suffer the same fate..."]
126: 2081| [45] [... I know.]
127: 2086| [45] [Watase tried to say that, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was a faint noise that sounded like a sigh.]
128: 2129| [45] [Watase and Kazami were soon no longer in any condition to carry people.]
129: 2173| [45] [... Their memories grew hazier and hazier.]
130: 2178| [45] [They'd left Jun and Ena in some room, but they couldn't remember where that was.]
131: 2183| [45] [All they knew was that they felt like hell and that their heads felt as though they were on the verge of splitting.]
132: 2276| [45] [After a while, they heard an explosion nearby--]
133: 2322| [45] [Watase got caught in the blast and was knocked away.]
134: 2327| [45] [His body was incredibly sluggish.]
135: 2332| [45] [He sat up and looked around him, but Kazami was nowhere to be found.]
136: 2337| [45] [His mind was a total void.]
137: 2342| [47] [Watase]
138: 2343| [45] [(Huh...? Why am I alone...?)]
139: 2348| [47] [Watase]
140: 2349| [45] [(I... I can't take this anymore...)]
141: 2354| [45] [Watase started walking as blood dripped down his right arm.]
142: 2359| [45] [A piece of debris like a thin, sharp knife was impaling it.]
143: 2364| [45] [He hadn't noticed his wound at all. It must have happened at some point earlier.]
144: 2369| [45] [It felt like the pain wasn't even his own.]
145: 2374| [47] [Watase]
146: 2375| [45] [(What... the hell... am I doing again...?)]
147: 2380| [47] [Watase]
148: 2381| [45] [(Oh... right... I need... to find AD...)]
149: 2426| [45] [And just as he stumbled astray into what appeared to be a connecting passageway--]
150: 2431| [45] [Watase suddenly lost his sense of balance.]
151: 2462| [45] [He collapsed, his face smashing into the floor.]
152: 2467| [45] [It hurt, of course, but that no longer mattered to him.]
153: 2472| [45] [... I don't need these...]
154: 2477| [45] [Watase no longer needed his body, his senses, his thoughts, or his memories.]
155: 2482| [45] [He just wanted one thing.]
156: 2487| [45] [... AD...]
157: 2492| [45] [That was the only thing Watase craved...]
158: 2497| [45] [... but before long, he no longer needed that either...]

161: 2635| [85] [ã€€]
162: 2638| [45] [The result of Watase worrying about his safety too much and failing to find any AD.]

164: 2644| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Watase's Senses very high at an SSS input around 11:48 AM.]
