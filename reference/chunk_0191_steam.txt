  1:   70| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   73| [45] ["I'm back."]
  3:   99| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:  102| [45] ["Welcome back~"]
  5:  107| [45] [Once Natsuhiko, Salyu, and Mashiro entered the living room, Yuuri greeted them as usual.]
  6:  208| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  211| [45] ["Whewww, we're back, Yuuri..."]
  8:  218| [45] [Mashiro sat on the sofa and took a deep breath.]
  9:  244| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  247| [45] ["... Hold on, guys. I'll make food after we rest a bit..."]
 11:  252| [45] [Yuuri blinked blankly and whispered to Natsuhiko.]
 12:  340| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  343| [45] ["... Did something happen to Mashiro? She seems really tired out."]
 14:  351| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  354| [45] ["Yeah, about that--"]
 16:  359| [45] [Natsuhiko explained to Yuuri what happened that day.]
 17:  364| [45] [The reason why Mashiro didn't come to the house in the morning. The existence of the terrorists. How the police and security department couldn't be relied on.]
 18:  369| [45] [But for now, he glossed over how Mashiro could use empathy and what happened at the Parapsychology Research Center.]
 19:  374| [45] [After listening to the story, Yuuri calmly spoke.]
 20:  400| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  403| [45] ["I see... sounds serious."]
 22:  411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  414| [45] ["Well, forget about me. I'm more worried about Mashiro..."]
 24:  419| [45] [She had probably been worrying herself sick about the potential terrorist attack ever since last night.]
 25:  424| [45] [She had been behaving energetically all day today, but once they got back to the house, she crashed as if all her tension had snapped.]
 26:  429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  430| [45] [(If I'd only believed her from the start, she wouldn't be so tired out now, would she...?)]
 28:  435| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko called out to her.]
 29:  443| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  446| [45] ["Okay, Mashiro! As a token of my gratitude for all the food, I'll be the one to make dinner today."]
 31:  533| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  536| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 33:  541| [45] [Mashiro's head jolted up in surprise. Yuuri's eyes widened too.]
 34:  629| [47] [Yuuri]
 35:  632| [45] ["That's new. -You're- gonna cook, Hikorin?"]
 36:  640| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  643| [45] ["Yup, I am."]
 38:  648| [45] [Yuuri couldn't cook at all. She couldn't even hold a kitchen knife. Which meant that Natsuhiko had to be the one to do it.]
 39:  714| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  717| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you can cook?"]
 41:  725| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  728| [45] ["Well, I tried before, but it was completely terrible. So that said, help me out, Salyu."]
 43:  754| [47] [Salyu]
 44:  757| [45] ["I can't cook either... but I'll try."]
 45:  765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  768| [45] ["Okay. That sound good to you, Mashiro?"]
 47:  855| [47] [Mashiro]
 48:  858| [45] ["Ah, thanks..."]
 49:  863| [45] [Mashiro seemed a little happy.]
 50:  985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  988| [45] ["Okay... let's begin, then."]
 52: 1029| [47] [Salyu]
 53: 1032| [45] ["... Okay."]
 54: 1037| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu stood in the kitchen and started off just lining up the ingredients.]
 55: 1063| [47] [Yuuri]
 56: 1066| [45] ["Go for it, Hikorin, Salyu~ Love is the very best spice!"]
 57: 1071| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58: 1072| [45] [(I think that's just a cooking cliche, but okay...)]
 59: 1080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60: 1083| [45] ["Well, two halves make a whole, so if we work together, I'm sure we can compensate for our lack of skill."]
 61: 1109| [47] [Salyu]
 62: 1112| [45] ["Cooking is just another form of chemistry. As long as you get the measurements and times right, it'll turn out good... probably."]
 63: 1117| [45] [And with that wishful thinking, they began to chop the ingredients.]
 64: 1299| [45] [But the two cooking novices stumbled even at that very first step.]
 65: 1307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1310| [45] ["Salyu, wash the rice for me."]
 67: 1336| [47] [Salyu]
 68: 1339| [45] ["Wash?"]
 69: 1347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1350| [45] ["Yeah, to remove excess starch."]
 71: 1376| [47] [Salyu]
 72: 1379| [45] ["Understood."]
 73: 1384| [45] [And with that answer, Salyu grabbed the kitchen soap.]
 74: 1392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1395| [45] ["Ah, no, that's not what I meant by washing it! I mean, you know, you run it under some water, and then you knead it!"]
 76: 1421| [47] [Salyu]
 77: 1424| [45] ["So I do need it?"]
 78: 1429| [45] [Despite their essential partnership, they were unable to communicate properly.]
 79: 1434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1435| [45] [(This could not possibly get any worse...)]
 81: 1575| [45] [As they moved on to make the side dishes, even more problems sprang up.]
 82: 1583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1586| [45] ["Salyu, the miso soup's too strong. Dilute it some."]
 84: 1594| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1597| [45] ["Roger."]
 86: 1602| [45] [Salyu answered like so and then tossed a bowlful of water into the pot.]
 87: 1610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1613| [45] ["Ahh! No, Salyu! You have to be more precise!"]
 89: 1639| [47] [Salyu]
 90: 1642| [45] ["D-do I?"]
 91: 1650| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1653| [45] ["You just said that quantities were important, didn't you? You gotta measure it out properly."]
 93: 1679| [47] [Salyu]
 94: 1682| [45] ["But the recipe doesn't say how much water to dilute it with. I can only trust my intuition."]
 95: 1708| [47] [Salyu]
 96: 1711| [45] ["Besides, the cooking terminology is too vague. What exactly is a pinch?"]
 97: 1719| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1722| [45] ["Uh, well, don't ask me. It's kinda..."]
 99: 1727| [45] [Even though they cooked while checking the recipe via PDA, the flavor mysteriously managed to betray expectations. Readjusting added another layer of difficulty.]
100: 1874| [45] [After nearly another hour of grappling with the ingredients--]
101: 1882| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1885| [45] ["Okay, it's done!"]
103: 1890| [45] [They finished cooking. Somehow or another.]
104: 1895| [45] [They brought the miso soup and the meat and vegetable stir fry to the table in two separate dishes.]
105: 1903| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1906| [45] ["Hey, Mashiro. Yuuri. We finished making dinner."]
107: 1932| [47] [Salyu]
108: 1935| [45] ["I gave it everything I had... or at least I tried."]
109: 2004| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 2007| [45] ["Hikorin, Salyu, good work~"]
111: 2086| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 2089| [45] ["Yeah, thanks guys."]
113: 2094| [45] [Mashiro spoke happily as she sat in front of the dishes.]
114: 2280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 2283| [45] ["Now then, everyone. Put your hands together--"]
116: 2323| [47] [All 4]
117: 2326| [45] ["Thanks for the food."]
118: 2331| [45] [And with that, they reached out to the dishes in front of them.]
119: 2336| [45] [But soon enough, Salyu spoke sadly.]
120: 2362| [47] [Salyu]
121: 2365| [45] ["... The soup really didn't turn out well."]
122: 2391| [47] [Salyu]
123: 2394| [45] ["It's because I botched measuring the quantities...!"]
124: 2402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 2405| [45] ["Huh!? No way!?"]
126: 2410| [45] [Shocked, Natsuhiko rushed to spoon himself a mouthful of miso soup.]
127: 2415| [45] [But it tasted as good as any run of the mill miso.]
128: 2423| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 2426| [45] ["It's okay, Salyu. It's good, you know?"]
130: 2502| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 2505| [45] ["It really is~ No need to worry~"]
132: 2582| [47] [Salyu]
133: 2585| [45] ["But it's not good at all compared to Mashiro's."]
134: 2593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2596| [45] ["Well, if you're gonna say that, then my stir fry's the same way, you know?"]
136: 2604| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 2607| [45] ["Let this just be a reminder of how delicious the food we normally get to eat is. I'm completely inexperienced too."]
138: 2633| [47] [Salyu]
139: 2636| [45] ["No, if you're going to say that, then I'm the one who's more inexperienced..."]
140: 2644| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2647| [45] ["No, no, I am..."]
142: 2652| [45] [The two of them kept trying to out-humble each other.]
143: 2657| [45] [Mashiro giggled at their little exchange.]
144: 2683| [47] [Mashiro]
145: 2686| [45] ["It's okay, guys. They're both delicious. Thank you guys so much."]
146: 2712| [47] [Salyu]
147: 2715| [45] ["O-okay... that's a relief."]
148: 2723| [47] [Natsuhiko]
149: 2726| [45] ["... Hahah. It sure is nice to hear someone praise your cooking, huh."]
150: 2752| [47] [Mashiro]
151: 2755| [45] ["Exactly. So now do you understand why I don't hate my role in this household?"]
152: 2760| [45] [Yuuri smiled as she watched the three of them converse.]
153: 2765| [45] [The cooking was plain and simple, but before they had realized it, their usual warmth around the dinner table had returned.]
154: 2771| [45] [But then--]
155: 2906| [45] [As if to shatter the calm mood, the sound of the intercom rang out.]
