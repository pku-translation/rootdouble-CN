  1:   61| [45] [Only one road led to LABO.]
  2:   66| [45] ["LABO Private Highway". The entrance had an inspection gate where all cars were checked.]
  3:   71| [45] [The facility was equipped with a nuclear reactor. That level of security was only to be expected.]
  4:  109| [45] [And at the entrance--]
  5:  114| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu were caught in the checkpoint as well.]
  6:  158| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
  7:  161| [45] ["Mm!? Who are you kids!?"]
  8:  166| [45] [They were stopped by a stern-faced traffic inspector.]
  9:  174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  177| [45] ["We want to go to LABO! Please let us through!"]
 11:  182| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 12:  185| [45] ["What the hell do you think you're saying? No. Definitely not."]
 13:  190| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 14:  193| [45] ["How do you even expect to get there? It's 10 km away, you know?"]
 15:  198| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 16:  201| [45] ["Stop spewing bullshit and go home, kids."]
 17:  234| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  237| [45] ["B-but we know Dr. Tenkawa..."]
 19:  242| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 20:  245| [45] ["I don't care who you know. Nobody gets through this inspection gate without a valid reason."]
 21:  250| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 22:  253| [45] ["If you want to get to LABO, then go through the proper routes to get permission from the Rokumei City Security Department or LABO's PR manager."]
 23:  261| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  264| [45] ["Permission? How long does it take to get that?"]
 25:  269| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 26:  272| [45] ["Anywhere from three days to one week, I suppose."]
 27:  277| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 28:  280| [45] ["Though I seriously doubt they'd take an ordinary student's application seriously."]
 29:  306| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  309| [45] ["N-no way...!"]
 31:  317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  320| [45] ["There could be a terrorist attack on LABO, you know!?"]
 33:  325| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 34:  328| [45] ["A terrorist attack? Well yeah, there's been a big commotion lately around town."]
 35:  333| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 36:  336| [45] ["We're already on guard. A little too on guard if you ask me, though."]
 37:  362| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  365| [45] ["No! It's not enough!"]
 39:  398| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  401| [45] ["There's a high probability that the terrorists could have a sleeper agent in LABO.%NHave you considered that possibility?"]
 41:  406| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 42:  409| [45] ["Sleeper agent? What nonsense is that?"]
 43:  414| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 44:  417| [45] ["Whatever, just go home already before I call the cops on you."]
 45:  422| [45] [And with that threat, the traffic inspector placed his hand on the phone.]
 46:  427| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  428| [45] [(The police...!)]
 48:  433| [45] [They had just cleared their names with the security department. If he called the police, things could quite possibly get troublesome again.]
 49:  438| [45] [Salyu gently whispered into Natsuhiko's ear.]
 50:  464| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  467| [45] ["Let's go home, you two. It's not a good idea to agitate the situation any further."]
 52:  493| [47] [Mashiro]
 53:  496| [45] ["B-but...!"]
 54:  504| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  507| [45] ["What we need to do is stop the terrorist plot. Not make enemies of the police and security department."]
 56:  515| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  518| [45] ["...!"]
 58:  523| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro were finally convinced.]
 59:  531| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  534| [45] ["... Okay. Let's think of a new plan, then."]
 61:  560| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  563| [45] ["It'd be for the best."]
 63:  589| [47] [Mashiro]
 64:  592| [45] ["... Excuse us."]
 65:  597| [47] [Traffic Inspector]
 66:  600| [45] ["Hmph. Better not see you here again even if you get lost, you hear?"]
 67:  648| [45] [The kids left the inspection point with that voice at their backs.]
 68:  674| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  677| [45] ["This looks bad... What do we do?"]
 70:  685| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  688| [45] ["Doesn't look like we've got a choice... Let's look for a pay phone for now."]
 72:  696| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  699| [45] ["Let's give a heads up to the police and the security department, and finally LABO."]
 74:  704| [45] [They nodded and began walking again.]
 75:  754| [45] [--As they walked about the main road, they soon found two pay phones lined up next to each other.]
 76:  759| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly looked up the security department number and called them.]
 77:  781| [47] [Security Dept.]
 78:  784| [45] ["Yes, this is the Rokumei Municipal Office Security Department, Takehashi speaking."]
 79:  792| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  795| [45] ["Thanks for all the hard work. It's me, Tenkawa, the Rokumei Academy student."]
 81:  800| [47] [Security Dept.]
 82:  803| [45] ["... Oh, well if it isn't Mr. Housekeeper. What can I do for you?"]
 83:  811| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84:  814| [45] ["Well, you see..."]
 85:  819| [45] [Natsuhiko gave the security department member a summary of Salyu's conjecture.]
 86:  824| [45] [However--]
 87:  832| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88:  835| [45] ["So basically, there's a possibility that the terrorists are targeting LABO..."]
 89:  840| [47] [Security Dept.]
 90:  843| [45] ["Yeah, we already know that. Thanks for your cooperation."]
 91:  848| [45] [The voice on the other side of the phone had not a hint of seriousness.]
 92:  853| [47] [Security Dept.]
 93:  856| [45] ["We'll give LABO a heads up, so just relax."]
 94:  864| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95:  867| [45] ["No, that still doesn't seem like enough... Can't you increase security or anything?"]
 96:  872| [47] [Security Dept.]
 97:  875| [45] ["Well, we'd have to dilute security at every other facility, and we can't exactly do that."]
 98:  883| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99:  886| [45] ["I know that, but isn't there anything you can do...?"]
100:  891| [47] [Security Dept.]
101:  894| [45] ["We can't work on possibilities alone. It'd be a different story if LABO at least received objectionable literature or something."]
102:  899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103:  900| [45] ["..."]
104:  905| [47] [Security Dept.]
105:  908| [45] ["Anyway, we'll strengthen security around the city."]
106:  916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107:  919| [45] ["Understood... Please do..."]
108:  968| [45] [Natsuhiko drooped his shoulders and hung up.]
109: 1030| [47] [Mashiro]
110: 1033| [45] ["How did it go?"]
111: 1041| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1044| [45] ["Well, at least he heard me out, but you know... How'd it go on your end?"]
113: 1049| [45] [While Natsuhiko was calling the security department, Mashiro was contacting the police.]
114: 1054| [45] [But she just looked dejected and shook her head.]
115: 1080| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1083| [45] ["No good at all. They kept insisting that security was sufficient."]
117: 1091| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1094| [45] ["Is our story too much of a stretch to get them to believe us...!?"]
119: 1121| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1124| [45] ["... What should we do?"]
121: 1130| [45] [Right when Salyu muttered that--]
122: 1135| [45] [They heard footsteps approaching in the distance.]
