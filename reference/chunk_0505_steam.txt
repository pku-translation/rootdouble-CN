  0:   60| [45] [--After passing the rescue worker exam through sheer guts and spirit--]
  1:   65| [45] [Jun finally fulfilled her dream of joining "Sirius" after half a year of waiting for her transfer.]
  2:   70| [45] [As such, she was moved from the Rokumei City Eastern Fire Department to the Central Fire Department...]
  3:  104| [45] [Then her first day of work arrived-- one which Jun faced with high hopes.]
  4:  109| [47] [Jun]
  5:  110| [45] [(This is where Sis works... the front line for rescue workers!)]
  6:  115| [45] [She wasn't only happy about getting to wear the uniform she'd admired for years.]
  7:  120| [45] [She was also excited about the prospect of possibly meeting "him" too.]
  8:  174| [47] [Jun]
  9:  175| [45] [(Maybe the hero who saved me when I was a kid is still here...!)]
 10:  180| [45] [Her memory of her savior was faint since it'd been nine years, but she felt she'd recognize him as soon as she saw him.]
 11:  185| [47] [Jun]
 12:  186| [45] [(Wonder if he'll remember me... I'd like to thank him once, at least.)]
 13:  203| [45] [She then entered the station with those thoughts in mind--]
 14:  233| [45] [And immediately came across a fellow rescue worker.]
 15:  260| [47] [Jun]
 16:  263| [45] ["Ah, good morning!"]
 17:  268| [45] [Jun saluted and greeted him.]
 18:  276| [47] [Jun]
 19:  279| [45] ["I'm Jun Moribe, Firefighter! I'll be working at Sirius starting today!"]
 20:  287| [47] [Jun]
 21:  290| [45] ["I swear I'll work myself to the bone to save lives, so let's both do our best together!"]
 22:  313| [45] [It was supposed to have been the perfect greeting.]
 23:  318| [45] [... But the worker didn't respond no matter how long Jun waited.]
 24:  326| [47] [Jun]
 25:  329| [45] ["...?"]
 26:  334| [47] [Watase]
 27:  335| [45] ["..."]
 28:  343| [47] [Jun]
 29:  346| [45] ["... Um, hello~?"]
 30:  372| [47] [Watase]
 31:  375| [45] ["Tch, not a speck of lady in this one either...!"]
 32:  383| [47] [Jun]
 33:  386| [45] ["Huh?"]
 34:  391| [45] [Jun was taken aback by how suddenly he clicked his tongue.]
 35:  399| [47] [Jun]
 36:  402| [45] ["Uh, what do you mean by 'this one either'?"]
 37:  428| [47] [Watase]
 38:  431| [45] ["Nothing. Just talking to myself."]
 39:  439| [47] [Jun]
 40:  442| [45] ["Then what about the 'no speck of lady' part!?"]
 41:  468| [47] [Watase]
 42:  471| [45] ["... I meant now our squad has two nutcases for women who decided they actually wanted to work to save lives."]
 43:  494| [47] [Jun]
 44:  497| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
 45:  523| [47] [Watase]
 46:  526| [45] ["Well, whatever. Once you enlist, there is no man nor woman. You say you'll work yourself to the bone? Well, you'd better mean that."]
 47:  546| [45] [The man left with those words.]
 48:  601| [45] [Utterly stunned by what had just happened, all Jun could do was watch him walk off into the distance.]
 49:  610| [47] [Jun]
 50:  613| [45] ["A... Asshole! The hell's his problem!?"]
 51:  618| [45] [A voice called out to Jun from behind right after she let that curse slip through.]
 52:  626| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  629| [45] ["Jun, what are you upset about?"]
 54:  686| [47] [Jun]
 55:  689| [45] ["Ah, Sis!"]
 56:  697| [47] [Jun]
 57:  700| [45] ["Hey, what's that guy's problem!? Our first meeting, and what does he say? 'Not a speck of lady in this one'!"]
 58:  708| [47] [Jun]
 59:  711| [45] ["I hate it so much when people tell me that!"]
 60:  737| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  740| [45] ["Who do you mean, 'that guy'?"]
 62:  748| [47] [Jun]
 63:  751| [45] ["That worker with the creepy eyes! Seriously, they look like a freaking lizard's!"]
 64:  777| [47] [Kazami]
 65:  780| [45] ["Lizard..."]
 66:  806| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  809| [45] ["... Jun, I think the man you're talking about..."]
 68:  835| [47] [Kazami]
 69:  838| [45] ["... is our squad's captain. Fire Lieutenant Watase Kasasagi."]
 70:  861| [47] [Jun]
 71:  864| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 72:  890| [47] [Kazami]
 73:  893| [45] ["The captain's been complaining about that for a while."]
 74:  901| [47] [Kazami]
 75:  904| [45] ["I believe his words were 'Five members on Team A, and two of them are women? What the hell is HR thinking?'."]
 76:  912| [47] [Jun]
 77:  915| [45] ["Misogynist prick! Why the hell does a son of bitch like that have to be my superior--"]
 78:  941| [47] [Kazami]
 79:  944| [45] ["Jun, watch your tongue! You can't use that kind of language here!"]
 80:  952| [47] [Jun]
 81:  955| [45] ["But Sis~..."]
 82:  960| [45] [Jun started pouting like a kid from her dissatisfaction.]
 83:  965| [45] [Kazami's face stiffened up at that moment.]
 84:  991| [47] [Kazami]
 85:  994| [45] ["Jun, this is a good opportunity for me to lay down some ground rules for you here."]
 86: 1002| [47] [Kazami]
 87: 1005| [45] ["First of all, you are not to refer to me as 'Sis' while we're on duty."]
 88: 1013| [47] [Jun]
 89: 1016| [45] ["Huh?"]
 90: 1024| [47] [Kazami]
 91: 1027| [45] ["I am your superior henceforth."]
 92: 1035| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1038| [45] ["As such, you are to treat me as such and will refer to me as either 'Fire Sergeant Tachibana' or 'Lieutenant'."]
 94: 1046| [47] [Jun]
 95: 1049| [45] ["Whoa, hey now, you can't expect me to get rid of old habits so--"]
 96: 1075| [47] [Kazami]
 97: 1078| [45] ["That's an order."]
 98: 1104| [47] [Kazami]
 99: 1107| [45] ["Furthermore, you are to use proper language when you are on duty. That is how I speak to everyone here, and you are to be no exception, Ensign Moribe."]
100: 1115| [47] [Jun]
101: 1118| [45] ["Oh shit, you're serious, ain't ya?"]
102: 1126| [47] [Jun]
103: 1129| [45] ["Geez, you're such a stickler, Sis~"]
104: 1157| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1160| [45] ["Do. You. Hear. Me. Loud. And. Clear?"]
106: 1189| [47] [Jun]
107: 1192| [45] ["..."]
108: 1197| [45] [Though Kazami was not often prone to anger, Jun knew that there was nothing scarier than an enraged Kazami.]
109: 1202| [45] [Thus Jun clicked her heels and gave a salute before that storm of indignation could burst free.]
110: 1210| [47] [Jun]
111: 1213| [45] ["P... pardon my insubordination, Lieutenant!"]
112: 1238| [45] [And thus Jun's life as a rescue worker unfolded.]
113: 1294| [45] [--Though he always sounded full of himself, Watase's skills were next to none on the field.]
114: 1327| [45] [Jun had passed both firefighting academy and the rescue worker exam at the top of her class and had been treated as a real up and comer by the Eastern Fire Department, but she was nowhere near Watase's league.]
115: 1332| [45] [Armed with his physical abilities, level-headed judgment, and vast wealth of experience-- all of which far exceeded Jun's-- he truly was an ideal rescue worker.]
116: 1366| [47] [Jun]
117: 1367| [45] [(H-hmph... not bad, I guess.)]
118: 1372| [45] [She couldn't stand his utter indifference, but she quickly grew to have faith in his skills.]
119: 1377| [45] [With Watase, Kazami, and Hiyama's cool heads balanced out by Dojima and Jun's wild personalities, the five of them made a great team.]
120: 1382| [47] [Jun]
121: 1383| [45] [(It's almost like human resources had that in mind when they assigned me...)]
122: 1433| [45] [--At first she wasn't sure about the whole deal, but her days at Sirius weren't so bad after all.]
123: 1438| [45] [But there was one thing that kept bugging her.]
124: 1492| [47] [Jun]
125: 1493| [45] [(... Where -is- that guy...?)]
126: 1508| [45] [Jun had been looking around the fire department to see if the rescue worker who'd saved her was there.]
127: 1513| [45] [But no one knew who she was talking about.]
128: 1518| [45] [Even Kazami was the same. All she had to say on the subject was "Who knows... Why don't you try asking the Captain?".]
129: 1523| [45] [But after Jun finally mustered up her courage and asked him, Watase simply said "Hell if I know" and left it at that.]
130: 1528| [47] [Jun]
131: 1529| [45] [(Well, I guess I'm glad it's not the Captain, but still.)]
132: 1534| [45] [At any rate, it'd already been over nine years since that day.]
133: 1539| [45] [It wouldn't be surprising if he'd transferred or something.]
134: 1544| [47] [Jun]
135: 1545| [45] [(... So I guess that means my hero's no longer here, huh?)]
136: 1550| [45] [Jun was a little disappointed that she couldn't show that man just how much she'd grown.]
