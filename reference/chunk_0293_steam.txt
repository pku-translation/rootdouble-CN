  0:   53| [45] [--It was clearly different from the simple Senses Sympathy that Natsuhiko had been using on Watase before.]
  1:   58| [45] [Visions like that of a dream long forgotten appeared to him.]
  2:   63| [45] [Those were Watase's memories-- the ones Natsuhiko had sealed away to protect Mashiro.]
  3:   68| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at the oldest memory Watase had that was relevant to this incident.]
  4:   73| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:   74| [45] [(Is this... from when Watase was back in high school...?)]
  6:   79| [45] [Just like when he'd checked Yuuri's memories, he knew that for a fact without anyone telling him.]
  7:  140| [45] [It was a memory of sixteen years ago, when Watase was just 16 years old--]
  8:  145| [45] [That day, Watase had been quietly reading a book in his room as he listened to classical music.]
  9:  150| [45] [And along with that sense of nostalgia--]
 10:  155| [45] [He heard "her" cheery voice play back in his ears.]
 11:  193| [47] [Wataru]
 12:  196| [45] ["Waaa-taaa-seeee!"]
 13:  201| [45] [Watase's calm, relaxing time was completely annihilated by that voice.]
 14:  206| [47] [Watase]
 15:  207| [45] [(Oh great, her again...?)]
 16:  230| [45] [Watase turned around to see a girl whose face resembled his own--]
 17:  235| [45] ["Wataru".]
 18:  243| [47] [Watase]
 19:  246| [45] ["Oh come on Wataru, I don't think the whole neighborhood quite heard that one. Something up?"]
 20:  275| [47] [Wataru]
 21:  278| [45] ["Look outside! Isn't the weather just wonderful!?"]
 22:  286| [47] [Watase]
 23:  289| [45] ["Huh... wait, that's it?"]
 24:  315| [47] [Wataru]
 25:  318| [45] ["Quit burying your head in those textbooks and come outside and play with me!"]
 26:  326| [47] [Watase]
 27:  329| [45] ["No. Playing outside just 'cause the weather's nice is something kids do."]
 28:  398| [47] [Wataru]
 29:  401| [45] ["Aw, don't be a spoilsport. You're gonna grow mold if you stay cooped up in this room forever."]
 30:  406| [45] [Wataru forcefully pried Watase away from his desk.]
 31:  414| [47] [Watase]
 32:  417| [45] ["H-hey..."]
 33:  443| [47] [Wataru]
 34:  446| [45] ["C'mon, let's get a move on. We're gonna go to the city, so hurry up and get your things!"]
 35:  454| [47] [Watase]
 36:  457| [45] ["... Okay, fine. Just give me a sec."]
 37:  505| [45] [Watase tried resisting her for a short while, but he soon caved in.]
 38:  510| [45] [He knew better by now than to go against Wataru whenever she wanted to do something.]
 39:  555| [45] [The gentle sunlight bathed the city streets.]
 40:  560| [45] [Watase and Wataru walked side by side in that weather.]
 41:  595| [47] [Wataru]
 42:  598| [45] ["Mmm, it really is such a nice day, huh? Feels like the whole world's shining~"]
 43:  606| [47] [Watase]
 44:  609| [45] ["I guess."]
 45:  614| [45] [Watase replied to Wataru's overjoyed voice with an apathetic mutter.]
 46:  687| [45] [Though she was his older twin sister and had almost the exact same face as him, their personalities could not be any more different.]
 47:  692| [45] [Watase was an indoors person who liked spending his days off reading books.]
 48:  697| [45] [Hence why the only reason he was out of the house right now was because Wataru had taken him out around town.]
 49:  758| [47] [Watase]
 50:  761| [45] ["So why'd you want to go to the city? Need to do something here?"]
 51:  787| [47] [Wataru]
 52:  790| [45] ["Nah, just figured I'd go look and see if there was anything I could get for you. Just got my latest paycheck from my part time job, so it's on me."]
 53:  798| [47] [Watase]
 54:  801| [45] ["Oh, then maybe some paperbacks from the bookstore would be nice..."]
 55:  828| [47] [Wataru]
 56:  831| [45] ["No and no. That'd kill the whole purpose of me treating you. We need something that we'll actually have fun buying..."]
 57:  857| [47] [Wataru]
 58:  860| [45] ["I know! How about your big sis picks out some clothes for you!?"]
 59:  868| [47] [Watase]
 60:  871| [45] ["Huh, no, you don't need to."]
 61:  897| [47] [Wataru]
 62:  900| [45] ["Why not? You've actually got some nice looks to start out with, so you can't let it go to waste by being plain all the time."]
 63:  908| [47] [Watase]
 64:  911| [45] ["Is that your subtle way of complimenting yourself?"]
 65:  937| [47] [Wataru]
 66:  940| [45] ["Ehe hee hee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 67:  945| [45] [Wataru walked with a clear destination in mind as they had that talk.]
 68:  993| [45] [She took Watase to a "cheap trendy clothes" shop and bought him all sorts of clothes.]
 69: 1057| [45] [They left the store with Watase covered in his new apparel, and with Wataru looking at him approvingly.]
 70: 1083| [47] [Wataru]
 71: 1086| [45] ["... Yeah, it's perfect! You're looking pretty sharp there, if I do say so myself."]
 72: 1094| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1097| [45] ["Think so?"]
 74: 1102| [45] [Watase had never been particularly mindful of what he wore. He just didn't think it was all that important.]
 75: 1110| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1113| [45] ["Whatever. Anyway, I'm starving. Let's get a bite to eat."]
 77: 1139| [47] [Wataru]
 78: 1142| [45] ["Okay then, but it's on you this time, you hear?"]
 79: 1150| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1153| [45] ["Mmph... oh fine, I guess I can do that."]
 81: 1179| [47] [Wataru]
 82: 1182| [45] ["Yay! Then let's go to the usual pasta joint."]
 83: 1187| [45] [Cheering happily and with a skip in her step, Wataru walked off. Watase followed behind her languidly.]
 84: 1195| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1198| [45] ["... But are you sure you want to be spending your Sunday hanging out with your brother?"]
 86: 1224| [47] [Wataru]
 87: 1227| [45] ["Why not? It's a really beautiful day and it's the weekend."]
 88: 1235| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1238| [45] ["You don't have a boyfriend or anything?"]
 90: 1264| [47] [Wataru]
 91: 1267| [45] ["Oh, I don't need someone like that. Not when I've got my cute little brother!"]
 92: 1275| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1278| [45] ["Ugh."]
 94: 1339| [47] [Wataru]
 95: 1342| [45] ["Hey, what's with that reaction! That ain't cute at all!"]
 96: 1347| [45] [Watase let out a wry laugh at Wataru's melodramatic voice.]
 97: 1396| [45] [The twins then finished eating--]
 98: 1445| [45] [They checked the bookstore afterwards and looked at some new novels, and before they knew it, the sun was coming down.]
 99: 1513| [47] [Watase]
100: 1516| [45] ["It's gonna get dark real soon. Shouldn't we be heading home?"]
101: 1542| [47] [Wataru]
102: 1545| [45] ["Yeah. We left without telling Mom and Dad a thing, after all."]
103: 1550| [45] [The twins decided to walk home to save money on bus fare.]
104: 1598| [45] [--And on their way home--]
105: 1603| [45] [Wataru suddenly shouted as they passed the fire department.]
106: 1636| [47] [Wataru]
107: 1639| [45] ["Ah! Watase, look! Look at that!"]
108: 1647| [47] [Watase]
109: 1650| [45] ["Hmm?"]
110: 1665| [45] [Watase looked into the station to see men wearing orange uniforms coming out.]
111: 1673| [47] [Watase]
112: 1676| [45] ["Who're they? Look a bit too snazzy to be firefighters."]
113: 1708| [47] [Wataru]
114: 1711| [45] ["They're a rescue squad."]
115: 1719| [47] [Watase]
116: 1722| [45] ["A rescue squad? Our city has one of those?"]
117: 1748| [47] [Wataru]
118: 1751| [45] ["Nope. They were probably just sent in from Tokyo or somewhere to give our firefighters some disaster prevention training."]
119: 1759| [47] [Watase]
120: 1762| [45] ["Huh. So what's the big deal about them?"]
121: 1788| [47] [Wataru]
122: 1791| [45] ["Whaddya mean, 'what's the big deal'? They're so cool!"]
123: 1799| [47] [Watase]
124: 1802| [45] ["Huh...? Oh, so you're into macho men like that?"]
125: 1828| [47] [Wataru]
126: 1831| [45] ["No, not that! I'm strictly talking about their job, not their appeal as men."]
127: 1857| [47] [Wataru]
128: 1860| [45] ["They go through hell and high water all to save lives! I really look up to people like that."]
129: 1868| [47] [Watase]
130: 1871| [45] ["Really?"]
131: 1897| [47] [Wataru]
132: 1900| [45] ["But there's no female rescue workers out there now, huh?"]
133: 1908| [47] [Wataru]
134: 1911| [45] ["If possible, I'd like to be one."]
135: 1919| [47] [Watase]
136: 1922| [45] ["What? That's news to me. You want a crappy job like that?"]
137: 1948| [47] [Wataru]
138: 1951| [45] ["Hey, don't call it a crappy job! It's a wonderful line of work!"]
139: 1959| [47] [Watase]
140: 1962| [45] ["Sorry, tongue slipped. But a rescue worker, huh..."]
141: 2011| [45] [Watase carefully looked Wataru over.]
142: 2016| [45] [She certainly had the attitude, but she wasn't all that good at sports.]
143: 2024| [47] [Watase]
144: 2027| [45] ["... I think it'll be tough for you."]
145: 2057| [47] [Wataru]
146: 2060| [45] ["Won't know until I actually make it to that point. I'll think about that stuff after I become one."]
147: 2068| [47] [Watase]
148: 2071| [45] ["I'm worried about -if- you can become one."]
149: 2079| [47] [Wataru]
150: 2082| [45] ["Hey! It's in really bad taste to stomp on people's dreams. Don't you have a dream?"]
151: 2090| [47] [Watase]
152: 2093| [45] ["Not really."]
153: 2119| [47] [Wataru]
154: 2122| [45] ["Huuh? Man, you're a real lonely boy, you know that?"]
155: 2130| [47] [Watase]
156: 2133| [45] ["Can't blame me on that one. The world's in recession and Japan's hitting a dead end.%NFuture's not looking all that bright."]
157: 2159| [47] [Wataru]
158: 2162| [45] ["You're overthinking things, Watase."]
159: 2188| [47] [Wataru]
160: 2191| [45] ["Do that and you'll just wuss out to the point where you won't be able to make sense of anything anymore."]
161: 2199| [47] [Watase]
162: 2202| [45] ["You really think so? Personally, I think it'd be better for you to think a bit before you act."]
163: 2207| [45] [He'd rather not be thinking along the same lines as her.]
164: 2212| [45] [But Wataru paid no heed to Watase's disapproval as she lifted her hand in the air.]
165: 2238| [47] [Wataru]
166: 2241| [45] ["Okay, I've made up my mind! Running training starts tomorrow!"]
167: 2249| [47] [Watase]
168: 2252| [45] ["Hmm, sure, sounds nice. Try to stick with this one longer than three days."]
169: 2306| [47] [Wataru]
170: 2309| [45] ["Why're you talking like you're not a part of this? You're gonna train with me."]
171: 2317| [47] [Watase]
172: 2320| [45] ["H-HUUUUH!? Why me?"]
173: 2346| [47] [Wataru]
174: 2349| [45] ["'Cause it'll last longer with two people, right? Besides, it's the perfect way to get your scrawny body into shape, right?"]
175: 2357| [47] [Watase]
176: 2360| [45] ["S-sounds like a total pain in the ass..."]
177: 2365| [45] [But as usual, Wataru wouldn't change her mind no matter what he said.]
178: 2370| [45] [And she was right that Watase was out of shape.]
179: 2378| [47] [Watase]
180: 2381| [45] ["... Okay, fine, I'll train with you. But only for a little while."]
181: 2407| [47] [Wataru]
182: 2410| [45] ["Yay! See, this is what brothers are for."]
183: 2415| [45] [Wataru let out a smile filled with happiness from the bottom of her heart.]
184: 2436| [45] [--What she had talked about may not have been enough to call a dream.]
185: 2441| [45] [But it was a fact that she was looking forward to her own future.]
186: 2446| [45] [Her innocent and pure hopes for her future...]
187: 2451| [45] [Having nothing like that at all, Watase couldn't help but be a little jealous of his sister.]
