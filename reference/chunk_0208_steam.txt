  1:   70| [45] [--Rokumei City Central Fire Station]
  2:   81| [45] [Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu got off the taxi in front of a building they had never visited before.]
  3:   86| [45] [They weren't entirely sure of how the fire department was organized, but the rescue squad members were probably here too.]
  4:  148| [47] [Salyu]
  5:  151| [45] ["The fire station... So that means we're here to see Jun Moribe?"]
  6:  159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  162| [45] ["Exactly. But it's kind of a gamble, though."]
  8:  189| [47] [Mashiro]
  9:  192| [45] ["I hope Jun's around..."]
 10:  197| [45] [But considering what had happened so far, they had no room for optimism.]
 11:  202| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  203| [45] [(We might get the same reaction we got from Prof. Tsubakiyama... so we need to be careful.)]
 13:  208| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  209| [45] [(I don't know if I can pull it off or not, but I'll try using empathy too.)]
 15:  214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  215| [45] [(I can't just make Mashiro do all the work...!)]
 17:  220| [45] [And with that thought in mind, they stepped foot onto the premises, prompting a cheerful voice to call out to them.]
 18:  277| [47] [Jun]
 19:  280| [45] ["Huh~? Well, if it isn't Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Louise. What's up?"]
 20:  288| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  291| [45] ["Ah, hello, Jun!"]
 22:  348| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  351| [45] ["It's been a while!"]
 24:  359| [47] [Salyu]
 25:  362| [45] ["Hello."]
 26:  367| [45] [Oddly enough, Salyu seemed to have "read the atmosphere" and greeted her courteously.]
 27:  393| [47] [Jun]
 28:  396| [45] ["Yup, great to see such well-mannered kids."]
 29:  422| [47] [Jun]
 30:  425| [45] ["So, what brings you guys to these parts? You didn't come all the way here to see little old me, now did you?"]
 31:  433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  436| [45] ["Actually, we did."]
 33:  462| [47] [Jun]
 34:  465| [45] ["Wait, seriously?"]
 35:  491| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  494| [45] ["You see, there's something we want to talk to you about..."]
 37:  544| [45] [The kids explained the circumstances to the cheerful and casual Jun.]
 38:  549| [45] [They told her about the terrorists boiling with hatred in the city.]
 39:  554| [45] [They told her about the possibility those terrorists could conduct destructive activities in various parts of town.]
 40:  568| [45] [--And at the end of their explanation, Jun asked them with a serious look on her face.]
 41:  594| [47] [Jun]
 42:  597| [45] ["... Is that true?"]
 43:  605| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  608| [45] ["It might sound like a joke... but it's true."]
 45:  616| [47] [Jun]
 46:  619| [45] ["Yeah... You guys sound like you're for real."]
 47:  624| [45] [As Jun made a bitter face, Mashiro asked her again.]
 48:  650| [47] [Mashiro]
 49:  653| [45] ["Jun, do you believe us?"]
 50:  679| [47] [Jun]
 51:  682| [45] ["Well~ If I had to go just by your story alone, it'd be hard to believe right off the bat, you know?"]
 52:  690| [47] [Jun]
 53:  693| [45] ["But there -have- been some things that have been bugging me lately, see..."]
 54:  719| [47] [Salyu]
 55:  722| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 56:  748| [47] [Jun]
 57:  751| [45] ["Well, they've been deploying us way too much lately."]
 58:  759| [47] [Jun]
 59:  762| [45] ["There's been such a spike in the sheer number of incidents alone that it just feels unnatural."]
 60:  770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  773| [45] ["Jun, do you think those accidents and incidents could be connected to terrorism?"]
 62:  799| [47] [Jun]
 63:  802| [45] ["I never thought about it at all, but hearing your story sure makes me think so."]
 64:  828| [47] [Jun]
 65:  831| [45] ["The atmosphere at work has gotten so tense lately. I wonder if everyone else has started to think something was off?"]
 66:  839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  842| [45] ["I see..."]
 68:  847| [45] [As he listened to Jun's answer--]
 69:  930| [45] [--Natsuhiko concentrated with all his mind.]
 70:  935| [45] [First he searched for Jun's characteristic brain waveform and quickly identified it.]
 71:  940| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72:  941| [45] [(Jun's a "Type 8", huh.)]
 73:  946| [45] [That was the waveform associated with idealists and challengers.]
 74:  951| [45] [He found it fitting as he concentrated further.]
 75:  956| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  957| [45] [(Now I need to try the same trick I did when I read Mom's mind. Assuming that wasn't just a hallucination, that is...)]
 77:  962| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78:  963| [45] [(Focus from the bottom of my heart: I want to know what's on her mind!)]
 79:  968| [45] [He fiercely wished to know whether or not Jun truly believed what they said.]
 80:  994| [47] [Jun]
 81:  997| [45] ["Hmm? What's wrong, Natsuhiko? What's with that strained face all of a sudden?"]
 82: 1002| [45] [Natsuhiko paid no heed to her voice and concentrated further.]
 83: 1007| [45] [And suddenly-- Jun's natural voice disappeared and another voice echoed in his head.]
 84: 1033| [47] [Jun]
 85: 1036| [45] ["... H-hey, are you okay? Can you hear--"]
 86: 1325| [85] [{It's like he can't even hear me... What's wrong? Honestly.}]
 87: 1326| [86] [Jun]
 88: 1327| [86] [{It's like he can't even hear me... What's wrong? Honestly.}]
 89: 1344| [85] [{Is he that worried...?]
 90: 1346| [85] [Well, I guess so, I mean they are asking me for help.}]
 91: 1347| [86] [Jun]
 92: 1348| [86] [{Is he that worried...? Well, I guess so, I mean they are asking me for help.}]
 93: 1365| [85] [{Yeah. So in that case, I better give him some reassurance.}]
 94: 1366| [86] [Jun]
 95: 1367| [86] [{Yeah. So in that case, I better give him some reassurance.}]
 96: 1544| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1547| [45] ["--!"]
 98: 1552| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
 99: 1557| [45] [This time, he was certain that it was no hallucination.]
100: 1562| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1563| [45] [(That was Jun's "mental voice"... I used empathy!)]
102: 1568| [45] [He was both surprised and grateful.]
103: 1573| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1574| [45] [(Looks like I've figured out the trick...! I guess intention really is important.)]
105: 1579| [45] [Perhaps people are best able to learn new abilities when they truly need them.]
106: 1584| [45] [Furthermore, Jun's innermost thoughts were full of concern for the three of them.]
107: 1589| [45] [Natsuhiko took a big breath of relief.]
108: 1598| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1601| [45] ["I-I'm okay... It was just so big a relief that you believed us that I nearly passed out."]
110: 1633| [47] [Jun]
111: 1636| [45] ["Hahah, a little faint of heart, are we? That's no good. You gotta man up if you're a boy."]
112: 1662| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1665| [45] ["But that's great. There was nobody else we could count on."]
114: 1691| [47] [Jun]
115: 1694| [45] ["Nah, nah, I'm glad to help out however I can."]
116: 1702| [47] [Jun]
117: 1705| [45] ["Well, terrorism is a little out of our area of expertise, but if you like, I'm sure I can talk with someone up--"]
118: 1711| [45] [But before Jun could complete her sentence,]
119: 1770| [45] [a shrill sound interrupted her.]
120: 1784| [47] [Salyu]
121: 1787| [45] ["!?"]
122: 1795| [47] [Mashiro]
123: 1798| [45] ["Huh, what!?"]
124: 1806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1809| [45] ["What's that sound!?"]
126: 1817| [47] [Jun]
127: 1820| [45] ["A dispatch...!"]
128: 1825| [45] [That very moment, Jun's face became stern.]
129: 1837| [45] [And at the same time, they heard a siren echo from the fire station building.]
130: 1846| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 1849| [45] ["Wh-what's going on!?"]
132: 1857| [47] [Jun]
133: 1860| [45] ["... I'm guessing it's got something to do with -that-."]
134: 1886| [47] [Mashiro]
135: 1889| [45] ["What... ah!"]
136: 1933| [45] [The kids didn't notice until Jun mentioned it.]
137: 1938| [45] [But far off in the distance, they could see black smoke.]
138: 1943| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1944| [45] [(Don't tell me that's another terrorist attack...?)]
140: 1949| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, Jun patted him on the shoulder.]
141: 1976| [47] [Jun]
142: 1979| [45] ["Sorry, I gotta go check it out for a bit."]
143: 1987| [47] [Jun]
144: 1990| [45] ["Looks like we'll have to save this discussion for later."]
145: 2016| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 2019| [45] ["Jun..."]
147: 2024| [45] [Mashiro spoke with an expression full of anxiety.]
148: 2029| [45] [But Jun just smiled as if to cheer her up.]
149: 2055| [47] [Jun]
150: 2058| [45] ["What's with that face?"]
151: 2066| [47] [Jun]
152: 2069| [45] ["The desire to protect this town is something all of us share."]
153: 2095| [47] [Jun]
154: 2098| [45] ["And I'm gonna protect this town my way. So you guys do whatever it is you can. Capisce?"]
155: 2106| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2109| [45] ["Y..."]
157: 2135| [47] [Mashiro]
158: 2138| [45] ["Yes!"]
159: 2164| [47] [Jun]
160: 2167| [45] ["Yup. Good answer."]
161: 2193| [47] [Jun]
162: 2196| [45] ["Later, guys. See ya!"]
163: 2216| [45] [The kids waved their hands as Jun headed inside the fire station.]
164: 2227| [45] [Before long, a firetruck emerged from the station and passed by.]
165: 2232| [45] [Natsuhiko muttered as they watched it leave.]
166: 2240| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2243| [45] ["Do whatever it is we can, huh..."]
168: 2269| [47] [Mashiro]
169: 2272| [45] ["Yeah..."]
170: 2277| [45] [They nearly had Jun's cooperation, but they couldn't quite get it.]
171: 2282| [45] [But be that as it may, just loitering here until Jun returned wouldn't quite be "doing whatever it is they could".]
172: 2290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2293| [45] ["Okay... let's go too."]
174: 2319| [47] [Salyu]
175: 2322| [45] ["Huh?"]
176: 2330| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2333| [45] ["If Jun's dispatching to the site of a terrorist attack, then the culprit might be there too."]
178: 2359| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 2362| [45] ["I see. 'The culprit always appears at the scene of the crime', right!?"]
180: 2370| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 2373| [45] ["Let's leave the firefighting to Jun's team. We'll go search for the culprit!"]
182: 2378| [45] [And with that decision made, the kids boarded onto the taxi once more.]
183: 2438| [47] [Natsuhiko]
184: 2441| [45] ["Mr. Driver, follow that firetruck!"]
185: 2446| [47] [Driver]
186: 2449| [45] ["Huh? H-hell yeah! ... I've always wanted someone to tell me that."]
187: 2454| [47] [Driver]
188: 2457| [45] ["Okay, voice command: Drive mode: 'Manual'! Here we go, boys and girls!"]
189: 2462| [45] [The driver slammed the accelerator and the taxi sped off.]
190: 2467| [45] [Towards the lingering smoke in the distance.]
