  1:   67| [45] [--Specialty schools like Rokumei Academy ran fulltime classes every second and fourth Saturday.]
  2:   72| [45] [So to prepare for afternoon classes, Natsuhiko bought some bread and ate it in the classroom.]
  3:   77| [45] [He and Salyu spoke sparingly.]
  4:   82| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:   83| [45] ["..."]
  6:  106| [47] [Salyu]
  7:  107| [45] ["..."]
  8:  115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  118| [45] ["... That sandwich good?"]
 10:  144| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  147| [45] ["It's okay."]
 12:  155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  158| [45] ["I see..."]
 14:  163| [45] [Without Mashiro as their mood maker, conversation just wasn't happening between them.]
 15:  168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  169| [45] [(I never thought this would be how I'd learn how much of a blessing it was to have Mashiro around...)]
 17:  174| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind--]
 18:  186| [45] [An announcement came streaming out of a speaker affixed to the classroom wall.]
 19:  191| [47] [Male Teacher]
 20:  194| [45] ["... Th-this is an emergency broadcast."]
 21:  199| [47] [Male Teacher]
 22:  202| [45] ["We've just received a report that a dangerous object was set inside school grounds...!"]
 23:  207| [47] [Male Teacher]
 24:  210| [45] ["Students, please remain calm and follow faculty instructions. Please evacuate to the schoolyard for now."]
 25:  218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  221| [45] ["--!?"]
 27:  226| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
 28:  231| [45] [And the whole class stirred in unrest.]
 29:  248| [47] [Male Student 1]
 30:  251| [45] ["A dangerous object!? For real!?"]
 31:  256| [47] [Male Student 2]
 32:  259| [45] ["N-no way... could this possibly have something to do with the commotion they've been talking about on the news...?"]
 33:  264| [47] [Female Student 1]
 34:  267| [45] ["No! What the heck!? Why are they targeting our school!?"]
 35:  272| [45] [The students' agitation created a positive feedback loop, quickly turning the classroom into a turbulent echo chamber.]
 36:  280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  283| [45] ["A dangerous object...? Like what...!?"]
 38:  309| [47] [Salyu]
 39:  312| [45] ["If they need to evacuate the students, then I assume it's either an explosive or a gas bomb."]
 40:  320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  323| [45] ["A bo...!"]
 42:  328| [45] [Natsuhiko choked on his words.]
 43:  333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  334| [45] [(No way... You mean Mashiro was right?)]
 45:  339| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko considered that possibility, Ena came rushing into the classroom.]
 46:  445| [47] [Ena]
 47:  448| [45] ["Class, you heard that announcement, right!?"]
 48:  453| [45] [Her voice was more forceful, her expression colder than usual.]
 49:  479| [47] [Ena]
 50:  482| [45] ["Life is long, so pipe down and listen up for now! First, everyone take your seats!"]
 51:  561| [45] [The students sat in their seats as instructed.]
 52:  566| [45] [Ena quickly scanned the classroom for empty seats.]
 53:  685| [47] [Ena]
 54:  688| [45] ["... Okay, so that's everyone with the exception of Ms. Toba."]
 55:  714| [47] [Ena]
 56:  717| [45] ["So now we begin evacuation. Line up in seat order and follow me!"]
 57:  795| [45] [The students muttered amongst themselves as they nervously stood up.]
 58:  800| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  801| [45] [(At the very least, it looks like they're serious about the dangerous object...)]
 60:  806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  807| [45] [(Then assuming there really is a terrorist or whatever... what if Mashiro went to search for them and actually ran into them...?)]
 62:  812| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  813| [45] [(Impossible. Such a stupid coincidence could never happen!)]
 64:  818| [45] [But despite his rejection of the idea, he couldn't shake off the anxiety he felt.]
 65:  823| [45] [Without thinking, Natsuhiko suddenly stopped in his tracks.]
 66:  864| [47] [Ena]
 67:  867| [45] ["... ? What's wrong, Mr. Tenkawa? Get in the evacuation line."]
 68:  875| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  878| [45] ["O-okay..."]
 70:  883| [45] [As he answered-- Natsuhiko heard a voice in his ear.]
 71:  941| [85] [{But Hikorin, you might regret not doing anything.}]
 72:  942| [86] [Yuuri]
 73:  943| [86] [{But Hikorin, you might regret not doing anything.}]
 74:  971| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped at those words.]
 75:  976| [45] [They were the words Yuuri had said this morning.]
 76:  981| [45] [And one second later, Natsuhiko opened his mouth--]
 77:  989| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78:  992| [45] ["... No, Professor."]
 79:  997| [45] [--and out came words he had never expected to say.]
 80: 1005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1008| [45] ["I'm sorry, but may I leave early?"]
 82: 1049| [47] [Ena]
 83: 1052| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 84: 1057| [45] [Ena, and even Salyu opened their eyes in surprise.]
 85: 1065| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1068| [45] ["Natsuhiko?"]
 87: 1094| [47] [Ena]
 88: 1097| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about!? Let's just evacuate first!"]
 89: 1105| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1108| [45] ["Um... yeah, I guess that would make sense..."]
 91: 1116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1119| [45] ["... But I'm worried about Mashiro's safety."]
 93: 1124| [45] [It was something that the usual Natsuhiko would never say.]
 94: 1132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 1135| [45] ["I'm really sorry, but I'm leaving."]
 96: 1161| [47] [Ena]
 97: 1164| [45] ["Huh? Ah! Hey! Wait!"]
 98: 1169| [45] [He heard Ena, but chose to ignore her.]
 99: 1174| [45] [He flew out of the classroom to find Mashiro.]
100: 1329| [45] [--When he got outside, the streaks of rain had more or less abated.]
101: 1334| [45] [Thanks to that, he could search outside without needing an umbrella.]
102: 1393| [45] [The only problem was that he had no honest idea where Mashiro could be.]
103: 1398| [45] [So for now, he just took out his PDA and tried to call her, but--]
104: 1406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1409| [45] ["Dammit, it won't connect!"]
106: 1414| [45] [It was ringing, but Mashiro wouldn't pick up.]
107: 1419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1420| [45] [(Is she still mad about yesterday?)]
109: 1425| [45] [He was fine with it if she wouldn't pick up. If she -couldn't- pick up due to injury or other danger, that would be a different story, though.]
110: 1430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1431| [45] [(Oh well, I guess I'll go look on foot...)]
112: 1436| [45] [The moment he made that decision, he heard Salyu's voice from behind.]
113: 1444| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1447| [45] ["Natsuhiko, what are you trying to do?"]
115: 1568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1571| [45] ["Huh? Oh, you followed me?"]
117: 1597| [47] [Salyu]
118: 1600| [45] ["Because you suddenly ran off. More importantly, why didn't you evacuate as you were told?"]
119: 1608| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1611| [45] ["It should be obvious. I'm looking for Mashiro."]
121: 1637| [47] [Salyu]
122: 1640| [45] ["For Mashiro? Why?"]
123: 1648| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1651| [45] ["Actually, last night, she--"]
125: 1656| [45] [Natsuhiko gave a simple explanation for what happened last night.]
126: 1682| [47] [Salyu]
127: 1685| [45] ["--Terrorists. That's..."]
128: 1693| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 1696| [45] ["Well, I think she's somehow mistaken, but for now, yeah, that's what we're going with."]
130: 1722| [47] [Salyu]
131: 1725| [45] ["But if that's true, then there could be danger involved. In which case, I need to protect you."]
132: 1733| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1736| [45] ["I see..."]
134: 1741| [45] [Actually, he didn't see. As always, he didn't quite understand her, but there was no time for discussion.]
135: 1749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 1752| [45] ["Okay, then let's search together."]
137: 1778| [47] [Salyu]
138: 1781| [45] ["Roger. Any guesses where Mashiro went?"]
139: 1789| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1792| [45] ["None. But we need to start searching regardless."]
141: 1797| [45] [And with that, the two of them ran into the rain.]
