  0:   64| [45] [--After interacting with Natsuhiko and the others, and regaining her love for Communicators--]
  1:   69| [45] [Ena put forth her effort into her commissioner work once again.]
  2:   74| [45] [She analyzed data from all students, not just those in her class, but everyone from elementary to high school.]
  3:   79| [45] [She also scoured archival data to find if any students in the past had shown signs of N-ification.]
  4:  141| [45] [But as she did so, Ena happened to come across a certain fact.]
  5:  146| [47] [Ena]
  6:  147| [45] [(A female student of this school died nine years ago...?)]
  7:  152| [47] [Ena]
  8:  153| [45] [(And she met with a fire that happened in LABO...?)]
  9:  158| [45] [The student's name was said to have been "Yuuri Kotono".]
 10:  163| [45] [For some reason, this knowledge stuck in Ena's mind.]
 11:  168| [45] [LABO was supposed to have been protected by perfect disaster prevention and security systems, so why would a fire happen there?]
 12:  173| [47] [Ena]
 13:  174| [45] [(... I'll go look into it a little.)]
 14:  219| [45] [Ena began a personal investigation into the matter.]
 15:  288| [45] [She spent a weekend researching the fire that happened nine years ago.]
 16:  293| [45] [As she fished for documents and gathered information here and there, various unusual points came to light.]
 17:  298| [47] [Ena]
 18:  299| [45] [(... Mr. Tenkawa was there too at the time of Yuuri Kotono's death?)]
 19:  304| [47] [Ena]
 20:  305| [45] [(And immediately afterwards, Mr. Tenkawa's aptitude rose...)]
 21:  310| [45] [Furthermore, LABO's performance improved soon afterwards.]
 22:  315| [45] [It became the top performing BC research facility in Japan, releasing innovation after innovation:]
 23:  320| [45] [Development of the BC-inhibitor, "AD".]
 24:  325| [45] [Development of the BC particle energy measuring instrument, the "Procyon".]
 25:  330| [45] [Development of anti-BC suits.]
 26:  335| [45] [Improvement of BC insulators.]
 27:  340| [45] [Enhancement of the WX particle amplifier output.]
 28:  345| [45] [Verification of the informational field hypothesis and upgrading it to the informational field theory.]
 29:  350| [45] [Among many other results.]
 30:  355| [45] [--How was LABO able to produce so many different results?]
 31:  360| [45] [Ena couldn't find the connecting thread among all of these facts, but she really didn't think it could've been a coincidence.]
 32:  365| [47] [Ena]
 33:  366| [45] [(There was another time when LABO's performance improved this much...)]
 34:  371| [47] [Ena]
 35:  372| [45] [(A year after LABO was established in 2016.)]
 36:  377| [47] [Ena]
 37:  378| [45] [(When Communicator A was still alive and confined as a test subject within LABO...)]
 38:  383| [45] [Around that time, the AD prototype was made and the WX particle amplifier's output was vastly strengthened.]
 39:  388| [45] [But with Communicator A's natural death in LABO in 2017, they had no results that stood out all the way through 2020.]
 40:  393| [47] [Ena]
 41:  394| [45] [(But starting in 2021, their productivity rose again-- and it's still rising to this day.)]
 42:  399| [47] [Ena]
 43:  400| [45] [(It'd be great to write it all off as a "coincidence", but...)]
 44:  405| [45] [But there was one other thing that bothered Ena.]
 45:  410| [45] [After A's death, thirteen years passed without them confining "a single test subject".]
 46:  415| [45] [That in itself might have been a joyous occasion, but it instead felt unnatural.]
 47:  420| [45] [Communicators who demonstrated Senses Sympathy were all confined to various labs.]
 48:  425| [45] [And each lab's administrator reported the confinements to the ESP Bureau. That was the secret law of the nation.]
 49:  430| [45] [But Rokumei City, with its 350 Communicators--]
 50:  435| [45] [--had not reported a single Communicator demonstrating Senses Sympathy. Was that not odd?]
 51:  440| [47] [Ena]
 52:  441| [45] [(Have there really not been any appearances of Ability Level 6 Communicators in Rokumei City...)]
 53:  446| [47] [Ena]
 54:  447| [45] [(... Or has one really appeared, and they're already confined in LABO?)]
 55:  452| [47] [Ena]
 56:  453| [45] [(And LABO has merely neglected their obligation to report it to us at the ESP Bureau...?)]
 57:  458| [45] [There was only one reason to neglect the obligation to report.]
 58:  463| [47] [Ena]
 59:  464| [45] [(They must be doing something they really don't want us to know about...)]
 60:  469| [45] [Ena's skin broke out into goosebumps the moment that thought crossed her mind.]
 61:  474| [45] [--Human experimentation. That was the term that came to mind.]
 62:  479| [47] [Ena]
 63:  480| [45] [(No way, that can't be...?)]
 64:  485| [45] [But as Ena had traveled across the country as a Commissioner, she had encountered a similar incident before.]
 65:  490| [45] [She had arrested researchers that had abducted and entrapped a Communicator to perform illegal experimentation.]
 66:  495| [47] [Ena]
 67:  496| [45] [(The same exact incident's happening in a government designated top secret city!?)]
 68:  501| [45] [It was just baseless conjecture without proof on her part.]
 69:  506| [45] [But as soon as she had harbored that suspicion--]
 70:  511| [45] [Ena's eyes changed from that of a teacher... to that of a commissioner.]
 71:  555| [45] [--After that, she continued her investigation even further.]
 72:  560| [45] [And after three months of investigation, she brought her results to ESP Bureau headquarters.]
 73:  638| [47] [Kuroda]
 74:  641| [45] ["... You're saying there's a possibility that LABO's been illegally abducting and confining Communicators?"]
 75:  646| [47] [Ena]
 76:  649| [45] ["Yes."]
 77:  654| [45] [Ena gave a clear answer to Kuroda's doubtful question.]
 78:  659| [47] [Ena]
 79:  662| [45] ["First, concerning 'Yuuri Kotono', a victim in the LABO fire nine years ago--"]
 80:  667| [47] [Ena]
 81:  670| [45] ["By putting the heat on the company that carried out her funeral service, I found out something quite interesting."]
 82:  675| [47] [Kuroda]
 83:  678| [45] ["That being?"]
 84:  683| [47] [Ena]
 85:  686| [45] ["Yuuri Kotono's funeral service was a complete farce."]
 86:  691| [47] [Ena]
 87:  694| [45] ["When she was laid in that coffin, she wasn't dead."]
 88:  699| [47] [Ena]
 89:  702| [45] ["They gave her sleeping medication, applied funeral makeup, and passed off the real Yuuri Kotono as her own corpse."]
 90:  707| [47] [Kuroda]
 91:  710| [45] ["They what!?"]
 92:  715| [47] [Ena]
 93:  718| [45] ["And before they cremated her body, they replaced it with a monkey's corpse."]
 94:  723| [47] [Ena]
 95:  726| [45] ["The bereaved family believed those ashes to be the remains of Yuuri Kotono and laid them to rest."]
 96:  731| [47] [Ena]
 97:  734| [45] ["And thus, she was dead to the world."]
 98:  739| [47] [Kuroda]
 99:  742| [45] ["Impossible... Isn't that too elaborate for an act? Yuuri Kotono's death was a sudden accidental death, wasn't it?"]
100:  747| [47] [Ena]
101:  750| [45] ["It appears the funeral service company had prepared for the opportunity beforehand. Somebody had commissioned them to do it."]
102:  755| [47] [Ena]
103:  758| [45] ["They did not disclose any information about the client... but it was probably somebody from Rokumei City, or perhaps LABO."]
104:  763| [47] [Kuroda]
105:  766| [45] ["So then you say they feigned Yuuri Kotono's death and confined her in LABO?"]
106:  771| [47] [Ena]
107:  774| [45] ["The possibility's extremely high."]
108:  784| [45] [After hearing Ena's report to the end, Kuroda took a deep breath.]
109:  789| [47] [Kuroda]
110:  792| [45] ["Tsubakiyama... you investigated this far on your own?"]
111:  797| [47] [Ena]
112:  800| [45] ["In my spare time as a teacher, yes."]
113:  805| [47] [Kuroda]
114:  808| [45] ["Well I'll be... You're not the same type as your father, but you seem to be quite capable in your own right, I'll give you that."]
115:  813| [45] [As Kuroda smiled wryly, Ena continued.]
116:  818| [47] [Ena]
117:  821| [45] ["... More importantly, how should we handle this case, Chief Kuroda?"]
118:  826| [47] [Ena]
119:  829| [45] ["Our duty is, first and foremost, to protect Communicators... Any illegal experimentation on them must be exposed."]
120:  834| [47] [Kuroda]
121:  837| [45] ["... Yes, of course."]
122:  842| [47] [Ena]
123:  845| [45] ["Then we should conduct an on-site inspection of LABO posthaste."]
124:  850| [47] [Ena]
125:  853| [45] ["Given the ESP Bureau's authority, that shouldn't be much of a--"]
126:  858| [47] [Kuroda]
127:  861| [45] ["We can't, Tsubakiyama."]
128:  866| [45] [Ena's eyes widened at Kuroda's response.]
129:  876| [47] [Kuroda]
130:  879| [45] ["Higa and I have already suspected that LABO and Rokumei City are up to no good."]
131:  884| [47] [Kuroda]
132:  887| [45] ["But even if we requested a compulsory inspection, the higher ups wouldn't approve it."]
133:  892| [47] [Ena]
134:  895| [45] ["Why!? Are we not a national agency!?"]
135:  900| [47] [Ena]
136:  903| [45] ["So why are we unable to search a facility administered by a local self-governing body!?"]
137:  908| [47] [Kuroda]
138:  911| [45] ["Normally, we could. We do have the authority to inspect every government designated top secret city and research institution."]
139:  916| [47] [Kuroda]
140:  919| [45] ["But for some reason or another, Rokumei City's LABO is the only place that's off-limits to our inspection."]
141:  924| [47] [Kuroda]
142:  927| [45] ["The reasons for the top brass' refusal seem to be 'insufficient evidence' and 'to ensure LABO's secrecy'."]
143:  932| [47] [Ena]
144:  935| [45] ["Impossible... Even for just a simple inspection? If they don't have anything to feel guilty about, then there shouldn't be a problem at all..."]
145:  940| [47] [Kuroda]
146:  943| [45] ["Yeah. So what I'm thinking... is that even the top brass here at the ESP Bureau have probably fallen to LABO's side."]
147:  948| [47] [Kuroda]
148:  951| [45] ["Perhaps by bribery or by blackmail."]
149:  956| [47] [Ena]
150:  959| [45] ["...!"]
151:  964| [45] [When Ena became speechless, Kuroda continued.]
152:  969| [47] [Kuroda]
153:  972| [45] ["... LABO is an independent administrative institution. Strictly speaking, they're not under the rule of a government agency like us."]
154:  977| [47] [Kuroda]
155:  980| [45] ["Naturally, at first they received national guidance and were set up in accordance with national policy, but they gradually grew out of our control."]
156:  985| [47] [Kuroda]
157:  988| [45] ["Currently, LABO's management is handled by Rokumei City, but the research results are sold over to a corporation called Betelgeuse New Treatments."]
158:  993| [47] [Kuroda]
159:  996| [45] ["In short, LABO is a commercial corporation posing as an administrative institution."]
160: 1001| [47] [Kuroda]
161: 1004| [45] ["Furthermore, since it's protected by the city, LABO can withstand all sorts of strain. It's an extremely nasty secret research facility."]
162: 1009| [47] [Ena]
163: 1012| [45] ["Then... the facility that my father wanted established to protect Communicators..."]
164: 1018| [47] [Ena]
165: 1021| [45] ["... has been reduced to a sinister corporate entity, performing human experimentation for profit?"]
166: 1026| [47] [Kuroda]
167: 1029| [45] ["We only have circumstantial evidence, but yes, that appears to be the case."]
168: 1034| [45] [Ena gritted her teeth at those words.]
169: 1039| [45] [--When her father was alive, he and the BC researchers he worked with all supposedly attended to the Communicators with good faith.]
170: 1044| [45] [Did the researchers' ethics decay through the sixteen years following?]
171: 1049| [45] [Based on the nature of the facility, if LABO so wished, they could conduct inhuman experimentation without anyone being the wiser.]
172: 1054| [45] [Had they gone so far off the deep end to do just that...!?]
173: 1059| [47] [Kuroda]
174: 1062| [45] ["... There's also another reason why the higher ups are reluctant to do a compulsory inspection."]
175: 1067| [47] [Ena]
176: 1070| [45] ["Huh?"]
177: 1075| [47] [Kuroda]
178: 1078| [45] ["National interest. Regardless of what happens internally in there, LABO undeniably produces results."]
179: 1083| [47] [Kuroda]
180: 1086| [45] ["Do you know just how much foreign money the development of BC insulators and AD earned? Roughly 800 billion yen."]
181: 1091| [47] [Kuroda]
182: 1094| [45] ["A sum that large more than compensates for the abduction of one or two Communicators in the eyes of the Japanese government."]
183: 1099| [47] [Kuroda]
184: 1102| [45] ["Even if the confined Communicators become N-ified, it should be fine if they've been shut away from the beginning. Public safety shouldn't waver."]
185: 1107| [47] [Kuroda]
186: 1110| [45] ["An' nobody bats an eye. Nobody's sad, and they all lived happily ever--"]
187: 1120| [47] [Ena]
188: 1123| [45] ["Please don't joke like that!"]
189: 1128| [45] [Ena's angry voice interrupted Kuroda's cynical sneering.]
190: 1133| [47] [Ena]
191: 1136| [45] ["What happens to abducted Communicators...!?"]
192: 1141| [47] [Ena]
193: 1144| [45] ["True, Communicators at risk for N-ification should be confined. We can't have a repeat of the tragedy 16 years ago."]
194: 1149| [47] [Ena]
195: 1152| [45] ["But Yuuri Kotono had Rank C Aptitude, you know!? There wasn't any need for her to suffer confinement!"]
196: 1157| [47] [Ena]
197: 1160| [45] ["If I just ignore this incident, then LABO could even start abducting my own students one day for all I know!"]
198: 1165| [47] [Ena]
199: 1168| [45] ["So please... I don't care what anyone says. I can't let LABO's crimes pass!"]
200: 1178| [45] [Once Ena finished shouting all of that in one go, Kuroda gazed at her hard.]
201: 1183| [47] [Kuroda]
202: 1186| [45] ["... You've really become a 'teacher', haven't you, Commissioner Tsubakiyama?"]
203: 1191| [47] [Ena]
204: 1194| [45] ["Huh? Ah..."]
205: 1199| [47] [Kuroda]
206: 1202| [45] ["So I take it you place priority in the dignity of the confined Communicators as individuals over the nation's agenda, then?"]
207: 1207| [47] [Ena]
208: 1210| [45] ["... I do. Is that so wrong?"]
209: 1220| [47] [Ena]
210: 1223| [45] ["What about you, Chief Kuroda? Commissioner Higa? Do you feel nothing?"]
211: 1228| [47] [Ena]
212: 1231| [45] ["It is our duty to protect Communicators, is it not?"]
213: 1236| [45] [Kuroda answered Ena's plea.]
214: 1241| [47] [Kuroda]
215: 1244| [45] ["... Exactly..."]
216: 1249| [45] [And Higa nodded as well, finaly breaking his silence.]
217: 1259| [47] [Higa]
218: 1262| [45] ["Tsubakiyama. You are correct."]
219: 1267| [47] [Ena]
220: 1270| [45] ["Huh...?"]
221: 1275| [47] [Higa]
222: 1278| [45] ["I didn't know your father, but I've read his journal several times."]
223: 1283| [47] [Higa]
224: 1286| [45] ["According to his accounts, Communicator A was unmistakably 'someone in need of protection'. Regardless of how dangerous she may have been."]
225: 1291| [47] [Ena]
226: 1292| [45] ["..."]
227: 1297| [47] [Higa]
228: 1300| [45] ["I was transferred from Public Security. From an objective position, the national agenda is absolute, and I believe that the safety of the public should receive priority over everything."]
229: 1305| [47] [Higa]
230: 1308| [45] ["But unless it comes at the cost of the safety of the public, the dignity of the individual should be protected with the utmost care as well."]
231: 1313| [47] [Higa]
232: 1316| [45] ["Two types of people live in this country. The great majority who does not know the truth, and those of us who do know."]
233: 1321| [47] [Higa]
234: 1324| [45] ["Those who do not know the truth should be allowed to live in public peace in blissful ignorance, unaware of both justice and evil."]
235: 1329| [47] [Higa]
236: 1332| [45] ["But we're different. Among those who know the truth, we are the only ones who can execute justice."]
237: 1337| [47] [Higa]
238: 1340| [45] ["If we forget justice, it means the decay of ethics. Isn't that correct, Tsubakiyama?"]
239: 1350| [47] [Ena]
240: 1353| [45] ["Y... yes!"]
241: 1358| [45] [Kuroda smiled at Ena's response.]
242: 1363| [47] [Kuroda]
243: 1366| [45] ["Heh, guess that settles it... We don't need no stinkin' permission. Let's make that compulsory inspection."]
244: 1371| [47] [Higa]
245: 1374| [45] ["With which members?"]
246: 1379| [47] [Kuroda]
247: 1382| [45] ["Well, we don't know who's in the pockets of the Rokumei City government. So let's just go with the three of us."]
248: 1387| [47] [Kuroda]
249: 1390| [45] ["It's a dangerous mission, though, so you don't have to come with us if you don't want to, you know, little missy...?"]
250: 1395| [47] [Ena]
251: 1398| [45] ["No. I'll go with you."]
252: 1403| [45] [Ena answered without hesitation.]
253: 1408| [45] [For she believed that was what her father wished for...]
254: 1465| [45] [--Several days later, the date of the compulsory inspection was set:]
255: 1470| [45] [Early morning, September 16.]
256: 1475| [45] [A fateful day for Ena's division, as it was the anniversary of her father's death.]
257: 1481| [45] [Their prepared provisions included a forged inspection warrant-- and a single handgun for Ena's self-defense only.]
258: 1486| [47] [Kuroda]
259: 1489| [45] ["LABO is a den of demons. We don't know what's waiting for us in there."]
260: 1494| [47] [Kuroda]
261: 1497| [45] ["If worse comes to worst, you need to be prepared to use this."]
262: 1502| [45] [And with those words, Ena steeled her heart.]
