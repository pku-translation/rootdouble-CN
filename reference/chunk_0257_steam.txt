  1:   57| [45] [--And then like raging waves, things kept happening one after another.]
  2:  189| [47] [Salyu]
  3:  192| [45] ["Ena... be careful of that 'captain'. He's a dangerous man."]
  4:  287| [47] [Watase]
  5:  290| [45] ["H-hey! What's that supposed to mean!?"]
  6:  316| [47] [Salyu]
  7:  319| [45] ["!"]
  8:  378| [47] [Ena]
  9:  381| [45] ["Ah, Ms. Sannomiya, wait!"]
 10:  404| [47] [Watase]
 11:  407| [45] ["Wait!"]
 12:  466| [45] [The two of them rushed to chase her, but what they found wasn't Salyu--]
 13:  525| [47] [Ena]
 14:  528| [45] ["That sound was...!?"]
 15:  536| [47] [Watase]
 16:  539| [45] ["It came from this way! Let's go!"]
 17:  610| [45] [However, they spotted what appeared to be a trail of Salyu's blood--]
 18:  673| [47] [Ena]
 19:  676| [45] ["Let's follow it!"]
 20:  684| [47] [Watase]
 21:  687| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 22:  805| [45] [But at the end of their mad dash was--]
 23:  852| [47] [Watase]
 24:  855| [45] ["Isn't this... a blood transfusion pack!?"]
 25:  881| [47] [Ena]
 26:  884| [45] ["What's something like that doing here!?"]
 27:  890| [45] [--Just then...]
 28:  970| [45] [Someone locked them inside the emergency stairwell.]
 29: 1014| [45] [And Watase discovered a time bomb hidden inside a fire extinguisher.]
 30: 1158| [45] [The bomb's countdown commenced.]
 31: 1223| [47] [Watase]
 32: 1226| [45] ["Open! Open up, you goddamn son of a bitch!"]
 33: 1252| [45] [Watase desperately screamed, but the door wouldn't open.]
 34: 1257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35: 1258| [45] [(I-It's no good--!!)]
 36: 1263| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko thought that...]
 37: 1336| [47] [Ena]
 38: 1339| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, out of the way!"]
 39: 1427| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40: 1428| [45] [(!!!???)]
 41: 1433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42: 1434| [45] [(Wh-why does Prof. Tsubakiyama have a gun!?)]
 43: 1439| [45] [Natsuhiko was astonished-- but Ena calmly raised her voice.]
 44: 1447| [47] [Ena]
 45: 1450| [45] ["Smash the door down now! Hurry!"]
 46: 1458| [47] [Watase]
 47: 1461| [45] ["R-right!"]
 48: 1581| [45] [Watase kicked down the fire door in accordance with Ena's command.]
 49: 1641| [45] [The two of them ran away from the bomb--]
 50: 1782| [47] [Watase]
 51: 1785| [45] ["Teach, get down!"]
 52: 1796| [45] [--but the blast never came.]
