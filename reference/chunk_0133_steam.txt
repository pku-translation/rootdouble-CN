  1:   91| [45] [First period, "Parapsychology"--]
  2:   96| [45] [A particularly important part of Rokumei Academy's curriculum. Its lessons take place in a special "BC room".]
  3:  157| [45] [The course teacher, Ena Tsubakiyama, stood at the podium with her pointer directed at the screen.]
  4:  165| [47] [Ena]
  5:  168| [45] ["--As the ages change, so too do humanity's means of communication."]
  6:  173| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  174| [45] [(This lecture again... Prof. Tsubakiyama really loves this story, huh.)]
  8:  179| [45] [Ena would often tell stories about BC like this. However, today's story was unusually basic information.]
  9:  251| [47] [Ena]
 10:  254| [45] ["Long ago, the humans who communicated their ideas through mere actions and gestures eventually developed the spoken word."]
 11:  262| [47] [Ena]
 12:  265| [45] ["Then writing was born, and not long afterwards, the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, and the internet... A communication evolution, so to speak."]
 13:  273| [47] [Ena]
 14:  276| [45] ["But at the turn of the century-- human communication came upon a major upheaval."]
 15:  284| [47] [Ena]
 16:  287| [45] ["Indeed, as you all know! That upheaval was the discovery of BC!"]
 17:  299| [45] [Ena controlled the computer as she spoke--]
 18:  374| [45] [--and text appeared on the screen.]
 19:  547| [47] [Ena]
 20:  550| [45] ["Beyond Communication! A new method to convey ideas without the use of language as an intermediary!"]
 21:  558| [47] [Ena]
 22:  561| [45] ["People of the past would simply write it off as ESP, wouldn't they?"]
 23:  569| [47] [Ena]
 24:  572| [45] ["However, this is no matter of the occult."]
 25:  580| [47] [Ena]
 26:  583| [45] ["The word 'occult' itself is derived from the Latin word for 'conceal' or 'hide'. Such a widely accepted phenomenon can no longer be considered part of the occult."]
 27:  625| [45] [Ena was exactly right.]
 28:  630| [45] [People who can use BC, popularly known as "Communicators"--]
 29:  635| [45] [--have made their existence known worldwide for the past 16 years or so.]
 30:  643| [47] [Ena]
 31:  646| [45] ["The historical turning point was in 2014. The year BC's existence was more or less proven scientifically."]
 32:  654| [47] [Ena]
 33:  657| [45] ["And just like clockwork, several Communicators started to be born worldwide that same year."]
 34:  714| [45] [New text appeared on the screen as Ena spoke.]
 35:  720| [45] [2014 was the year Natsuhiko and Mashiro were born.]
 36:  725| [45] [Society transformed in many ways in the following years, but Natsuhiko was not quite sure of the details.]
 37:  730| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  731| [45] [(... I've heard humans don't remember things that don't interest them. I guess it's true.)]
 39:  736| [45] [In stark contrast to Natsuhiko's listlessness, Ena continued her eloquent lecture.]
 40:  774| [47] [Ena]
 41:  777| [45] ["Now then-- there are two abilities available to Communicators."]
 42:  785| [47] [Ena]
 43:  788| [45] ["The first is 'telepathy', the ability to convey one's ideas to others. This ability was discovered directly following the Grand BC Discovery 16 years ago."]
 44:  796| [47] [Ena]
 45:  799| [45] ["The second is 'empathy', the ability to read the minds of others. The existence of this ability was proven the following year."]
 46:  807| [47] [Ena]
 47:  810| [45] ["Quite a few of you can use telepathy, right? The number of telepathy users has been growing each year."]
 48:  818| [47] [Ena]
 49:  821| [45] ["In Japan specifically, the rate of new Communicator discovery has grown consistently over the past 16 years. This is truly an example of the Japanese--"]
 50: 1073| [45] [Natsuhiko glanced at Mashiro as he turned a deaf ear to Ena's lecture.]
 51: 1078| [45] [The ability Mashiro used to stop the bus earlier this morning was a prime example of telepathy.]
 52: 1083| [45] [But the extent of the ability she used there was not at all uncommon.]
 53: 1160| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54: 1161| [45] [(The "Esper's Nest", huh...)]
 55: 1166| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed as he recalled the honorable, yet somehow odd nickname given to his school.]
 56: 1384| [45] [--BC is a convenient ability to have, but to master it requires quite a bit of practice.]
 57: 1389| [45] [And so in recent years, it was decided that a school would be established for the technical training of Communicators to improve their abilities.]
 58: 1394| [45] [In other words, it was to be a school meant solely for Communicators. That school was the very same school Natsuhiko attended: the parapsychology specialty school, Rokumei Academy.]
 59: 1454| [45] [Rokumei Academy is integrated from elementary to high school in order to provide special education for gifted children starting at a young age.]
 60: 1458| [45] [And naturally, its curriculum includes a great number of BC-related classes.]
 61: 1463| [45] [Acceptance to Rokumei Academy requires BC "aptitude".]
 62: 1468| [45] [Every year when new students enter the school, the principal makes this speech:]
 63: 1485| [45] [--"You all have passed a rigorous selection process, and may now consider yourselves part of the BC elite."--]
 64: 1509| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1510| [45] [(Elite, huh...)]
 66: 1515| [45] [Natsuhiko coldly pondered the principal's words.]
 67: 1639| [45] [Once Natsuhiko finished his little recollection, Ena's voice finally reached him again.]
 68: 1647| [47] [Ena]
 69: 1650| [45] ["--And actually, Japan was the first country to advance training initiatives."]
 70: 1658| [47] [Ena]
 71: 1661| [45] ["A grand slam for the country if I must say so myself. As a direct result, there's been widespread..."]
 72: 1730| [45] [Eventually, out of the entire class of bored students, a few began to call out with wry smiles on their faces.]
 73: 1735| [47] [Male Student 1]
 74: 1738| [45] ["Um, Teach, don't you think today's introduction is just a little too basic for us?"]
 75: 1743| [47] [Male Student 2]
 76: 1746| [45] ["I don't think there's a single student in this school that doesn't know this already."]
 77: 1751| [47] [Female Student 1]
 78: 1754| [45] ["Yeah, I'd rather hear more of your usual BC knowledge."]
 79: 1840| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1843| [45] ["Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I guess I got a bit carried away. I was up late last night watching a documentary on the birth of BC."]
 81: 1848| [45] [Ena cleared her throat and erased the text on the screen. Somewhat sadly.]
 82: 1874| [47] [Ena]
 83: 1877| [45] ["... Now then, let's leave the lecture at that. How about we start practical lessons now?"]
 84: 1903| [47] [Ena]
 85: 1906| [45] ["Let's partner up, everybody."]
 86: 1957| [45] [And with that, the students turned to their neighbors like usual.]
 87: 1962| [45] [Which is why students often sat next to people they were close to in this class.]
 88: 1981| [47] [Ena]
 89: 1984| [45] ["Now then, class, start practicing!"]
 90: 2035| [45] [At that signal, everyone began practicing at once.]
 91: 2046| [45] [And immediately, the noisy "whispers" of telepathy filled Natsuhiko's head.]
 92: 2051| [45] [If these whispers were to reach the other classrooms, they'd be a nuisance.]
 93: 2056| [45] [However, the BC room's walls used a material that dampened the conduction of telepathy, allowing the students to practice without worrying about their noise.]
 94: 2143| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95: 2146| [45] ["Okay, guess I'll try it out too, Mashiro."]
 96: 2151| [45] [When Natsuhiko turned her way and said this, Mashiro couldn't help but curl her lips into a dauntless smile.]
 97: 2159| [47] [Mashiro]
 98: 2162| [45] ["Oh? Are you challenging Ms. 'Level 3' Mashiro to a BC competition?"]
 99: 2170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 2173| [45] ["Why do you always have to make it into a competition? This is just practice, you know."]
101: 2199| [47] [Mashiro]
102: 2202| [45] ["But I've long since mastered telepathy, you know. You're the one who needs practice, right Natsuhiko?"]
103: 2228| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 2231| [45] ["I'll be your practice partner, so hit me with your best shot. Hey, c'mon!"]
105: 2240| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 2243| [45] ["Hmph, you're so full of yourself..."]
107: 2366| [45] [Natsuhiko closed his eyes and put a finger to his temple.]
108: 2371| [45] [This posture is key to facilitating the use of telepathy.]
109: 2376| [45] [It's the same technique Mashiro used when she stopped the bus.]
110: 2397| [47] [(Dammit Mashiro, get off that high horse...)]
111: 2419| [45] [Natsuhiko brought those words to mind.]
112: 2498| [45] [He then searched around for Mashiro's brainwaves--]
113: 2503| [45] [And concentrated hard to get her to hear his voice.]
114: 2541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 2544| [45] ["--!"]
116: 2552| [47] [Mashiro]
117: 2555| [45] ["... Mmm!?"]
118: 2609| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 2612| [45] ["... So, did you hear me?"]
120: 2635| [45] [Natsuhiko opened his eyes to see Mashiro grinning at him.]
121: 2667| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 2670| [45] ["Loud and clear~ 'You're oh so very cute, Mashiro! So lovely! Supah kawaii!' and such."]
123: 2678| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 2681| [45] ["Hmm, I see. So whatever I think, you hear the exact opposite. Looks like we've just discovered a brand new ability."]
125: 2707| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 2710| [45] ["Huh, the exact opposite!?"]
127: 2718| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 2721| [45] ["Well, in any case, telepathy's just too hard for me. I still don't feel like I can do it."]
129: 2747| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 2750| [45] ["Hey, it's too early to give up. It's not like you can expect to suddenly run before you can walk, you know?"]
131: 2758| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2761| [45] ["Look, it's not a simple issue of effort. I'm just not cut out for it."]
133: 2813| [45] [Natsuhiko was incapable of the fundamental of fundamentals: short distance telepathy with a familiar target.]
134: 2818| [45] [In the six-level system of ability ranking, his was the lowest at Level 0.]
135: 2823| [45] [An extreme oddity for students of this school.]
136: 2840| [45] [But suddenly, a voice of concern called out to them.]
137: 2916| [47] [Ena]
138: 2919| [45] ["Oh, but I think Mr. Tenkawa's got the talent, you know?"]
139: 2945| [47] [Mashiro]
140: 2948| [45] ["Oh, you think so too, Ms. Ena?"]
141: 2956| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 2959| [45] ["Hmm... but personally, I don't think I do."]
143: 2985| [47] [Ena]
144: 2988| [45] ["But your 'aptitude' measurement from childhood was quite high, wasn't it?"]
145: 2996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2999| [45] ["Yeah, but..."]
147: 3004| [45] [Even he found that a mystery himself.]
148: 3055| [45] [--Latent BC talent could be quantified through genetic analysis.]
149: 3060| [45] [This measurement was called "aptitude", and was broken down into six ranks:%NE, D, C, B, A, and S.]
150: 3065| [45] [And for some reason, Natsuhiko's aptitude was top-class at Rank S.]
151: 3070| [45] [But despite his aptitude, his talent was nonexistent.]
152: 3075| [45] [And he wasn't just teased once or twice about it.]
153: 3080| [45] [Which may or may not be a factor as to why Natsuhiko thoroughly hated the use of BC now.]
154: 3120| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 3123| [45] ["... I'm thinking maybe that aptitude test was just wrong somehow."]
156: 3149| [47] [Ena]
157: 3152| [45] ["That can't be. Aptitude is determined from birth and stays the same your entire life."]
158: 3178| [47] [Ena]
159: 3181| [45] ["It's never changed from Rank S despite all the tests you've had each April, has it?"]
160: 3189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 3192| [45] ["Well, guess not..."]
162: 3197| [45] [Secretly, that wasn't the whole truth-- but it was a long story, so Natsuhiko just left it at that.]
163: 3267| [47] [Mashiro]
164: 3270| [45] ["Even I'm just Rank B. Theoretically you should have more talent than me, Natsuhiko."]
165: 3278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 3281| [45] ["Well, talent doesn't necessarily translate to ability, you know."]
167: 3307| [47] [Ena]
168: 3310| [45] ["What are you saying? Be more confident in yourself!"]
169: 3336| [47] [Ena]
170: 3339| [45] ["I've never seen another Rank S student besides you, Mr. Tenkawa."]
171: 3365| [47] [Mashiro]
172: 3368| [45] ["You're too soft on Natsuhiko, Ms. Ena~ You shouldn't coddle him like that!"]
173: 3394| [47] [Ena]
174: 3397| [45] ["Now, now, don't say things like that. I love all of my students equally, you know?"]
175: 3423| [47] [Ena]
176: 3426| [45] ["Though I do admit I am quite intrigued by the disparity between Mr. Tenkawa's aptitude and ability."]
177: 3498| [45] [Natsuhiko inadvertently looked away as soon as he saw Ena's teasing smile.]
178: 3714| [45] [Ena had only started teaching here since April, but she was a good teacher with devotion to her students and enthusiasm for education.]
179: 3719| [45] [She seemed particularly "fond" of Natsuhiko, and always looked after him like this.]
180: 3773| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 3774| [45] [(I know she's not trying to be mean, but... I really don't like it when people bring up the topic of BC.)]
182: 3888| [47] [Ena]
183: 3891| [45] ["Anyway, you're just a late bloomer, Mr. Tenkawa. Try hard and get Ms. Toba to help teach you."]
184: 3917| [47] [Mashiro]
185: 3920| [45] ["Leave it to me, Ms. Ena. I'll slap some sense into him!"]
186: 3928| [47] [Natsuhiko]
187: 3931| [45] ["... P-please be gentle."]
188: 4048| [45] [--And thus, Natsuhiko and Mashiro practiced telepathy for a while.]
189: 4071| [45] [But as always, Natsuhiko showed no signs of a breakthrough--]
190: 4094| [45] [And the end of class drew near.]
191: 4122| [45] [Having been Natsuhiko's practice partner for his entire school career, Mashiro was stumped.]
192: 4148| [47] [Mashiro]
193: 4151| [45] ["... Mmm, looks like today's no good either."]
194: 4159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 4162| [45] ["Yeah, no good."]
196: 4188| [47] [Mashiro]
197: 4191| [45] ["You're always so unmotivated, Natsuhiko. Even though you've got such a cute practice partner."]
198: 4199| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 4202| [45] ["You say so, but you know... Telepathy isn't really all that useful to begin with."]
200: 4228| [47] [Mashiro]
201: 4231| [45] ["Come again? That's an unbecoming statement for a student of this school."]
202: 4239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 4242| [45] ["I mean, look. If you want to 'convey ideas to others', why don't you just speak to them verbally?"]
204: 4250| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 4253| [45] ["At best, you can use it to communicate with someone farther away, but--"]
206: 4279| [47] [Mashiro]
207: 4282| [45] ["Tsk tsk tsk. You really don't get it, do you, Natsuhiko?"]
208: 4290| [47] [Mashiro]
209: 4293| [45] ["Your voice isn't the only thing you can convey with telepathy."]
210: 4319| [47] [Mashiro]
211: 4322| [45] ["You can even convey thoughts and emotions that can't be put into words."]
212: 4330| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 4333| [45] ["I know that, but is it even really that useful? I just don't get it."]
214: 4359| [47] [Mashiro]
215: 4362| [45] ["Ah geez, have you no sense of wonder!?"]
216: 4370| [47] [Mashiro]
217: 4373| [45] ["Fine. In that case, let me give you a little first-hand demonstration!"]
218: 4396| [45] [Mashiro put her finger up to her temple, exasperated.]
219: 4404| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 4407| [45] ["Huh, no, you really don't have to..."]
221: 4412| [45] [The moment those words left Natsuhiko's lips--]
222: 4418| [45] [Mashiro's voice rang through his head.]
223: 4472| [85] [{You keep ogling at Ms. Ena.]
224: 4474| [85] [Cut it out already!}]
225: 4490| [86] [Mashiro]
226: 4491| [86] [{You keep ogling at Ms. Ena. Cut it out already!}]
227: 4498| [85] [{How do you expect to practice when you're that distracted!?}]
228: 4515| [86] [Mashiro]
229: 4516| [86] [{How do you expect to practice when you're that distracted!?}]
230: 4533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
231: 4536| [45] ["...!"]
232: 4541| [45] [Along with hearing Mashiro's words, Natsuhiko felt her "emotion"--%Nanger and resentment.]
233: 4549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 4552| [45] ["Y... you saw that?"]
235: 4578| [47] [Mashiro]
236: 4581| [45] ["Yeah. So much that I'm starting to realize how stupid it was of me to practice with you."]
237: 4589| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 4592| [45] ["I-I see. I'm sorry about that."]
239: 4597| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 4598| [45] [(I wasn't really aware I was doing it myself... I guess older women are one of my weaknesses.)]
241: 4603| [45] [The moment that thought passed through Natsuhiko's mind, Ena stood at the podium and spoke.]
242: 4695| [47] [Ena]
243: 4698| [45] ["Now then, everyone, it's just about time for class to end..."]
244: 4706| [47] [Ena]
245: 4709| [45] ["How was practice today? Get any good results?"]
246: 4760| [47] [Male Student 1]
247: 4763| [45] ["Haah, I guess..."]
248: 4768| [47] [Female Student 1]
249: 4771| [45] ["My point-blank range telepathy's pretty much perfect now!"]
250: 4776| [45] [Candid answers flew across the room from all directions.]
251: 4807| [45] [Ena smiled and addressed her students.]
252: 4815| [47] [Ena]
253: 4818| [45] ["Sounds like everyone's walking at their own pace. But for those of you who aren't seeing much improvement, there's no need to rush."]
254: 4844| [47] [Ena]
255: 4847| [45] ["BC mastery takes time, after all."]
256: 4873| [47] [Ena]
257: 4876| [45] ["However... regardless of your ability level or total practice time, there's one thing I can say with certainty."]
258: 4902| [47] [Ena]
259: 4905| [45] ["The most important thing for BC is-- without a doubt, 'concentration'!"]
260: 4913| [47] [Ena]
261: 4916| [45] ["Unlike the other five senses, you need concentration that transcends common sense if you want to draw out the 'sixth sense'!"]
262: 4921| [47] [Male Student 1]
263: 4924| [45] ["Mmm, but I -am- trying to concentrate..."]
264: 4929| [45] [A boy who seemed quite lacking in concentration mused.%NEna smiled and replied.]
265: 4955| [47] [Ena]
266: 4958| [45] ["It can't be halfhearted concentration."]
267: 4984| [47] [Ena]
268: 4987| [45] ["It's said that the concentration necessary for BC use is so extreme that it causes the five senses to dampen in turn."]
269: 4995| [47] [Ena]
