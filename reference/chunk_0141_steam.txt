  1:   83| [45] [------]
  2:   88| [45] [----]
  3:   93| [45] [--]
  4:  101| [47] [Woman]
  5:  104| [45] ["--here."]
  6:  186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  189| [45] ["... Huh?"]
  8:  242| [45] [Hearing someone call out to him, Natsuhiko suddenly snapped out of his daze.]
  9:  264| [45] [Mashiro was there before his eyes.]
 10:  332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  333| [45] [(Huh, I'm... at home?)]
 12:  344| [45] [He had the feeling he was somewhere completely different just a moment ago.]
 13:  349| [45] [But-- there's no way he could've gone out this early in the morning. It was probably just his imagination.]
 14:  354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  355| [45] [(Am I still half asleep...?)]
 16:  392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  395| [45] ["Um... come again?"]
 18:  403| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  406| [45] ["What do you mean, 'come again?' You told me to show you my hand, remember?"]
 20:  460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  463| [45] ["Did I?"]
 22:  471| [47] [Mashiro]
 23:  474| [45] ["Yeah. I tried to pry open a stubborn bottle and hurt my finger."]
 24:  482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  485| [45] ["Ah, sorry... I forgot."]
 26:  499| [45] [He took a closer look at Mashiro's finger, and sure enough there was a small wound on it.]
 27:  580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  583| [45] ["Mm, looks painful... I'll put a bandage on it."]
 29:  781| [45] [Natsuhiko took a bandage out of the medicine box and wrapped it around Mashiro's finger.]
 30:  789| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  792| [45] ["You're so careless, Mashiro."]
 32:  818| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  821| [45] ["Hahah, I'm so ashamed."]
 34:  826| [45] [Natsuhiko finished wrapping the bandage.]
 35:  834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  837| [45] ["... All right, that should do it."]
 37:  863| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  866| [45] ["Thanks."]
 39:  985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  988| [45] ["What, it's not that big a deal. Just stick a bandage on it and it'll heal."]
 41: 1075| [47] [Mashiro]
 42: 1078| [45] ["Yeah. So can I borrow a bandage?"]
 43: 1086| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44: 1089| [45] ["Sure, they're right in that medicine box."]
 45: 1115| [47] [Mashiro]
 46: 1118| [45] ["Thanks."]
 47: 1246| [45] [Mashiro took a bandage out of the medicine box and wrapped it around her finger.]
 48: 1272| [47] [Mashiro]
 49: 1275| [45] ["Alrighty, guess I'll go whip up some breakfast, then. Hang tight."]
 50: 1308| [45] [And with that, she went back to the kitchen.]
 51: 1573| [45] [--An everyday sight.]
 52: 1578| [45] [A peaceful morning just like the last.]
 53: 1583| [45] [Eventually, Yuuri came out of her room too.]
 54: 1637| [47] [Yuuri]
 55: 1640| [45] ["Hikorin, Mashiron, good morning~"]
 56: 1648| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1651| [45] ["Ah, good morning, Yuuri."]
 58: 1659| [47] [Mashiro]
 59: 1662| [45] ["Huh? Oh, good morning, Yuuri~"]
 60: 1679| [45] [After an exchange of salutations, Yuuri waited to eat breakfast with the other two.]
 61: 1684| [45] [Natsuhiko enjoyed these leisurely mornings of his.]
 62: 1738| [47] [Mashiro]
 63: 1741| [45] ["--Okay! Food's ready. Help me carry it over~"]
 64: 1749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1752| [45] ["Ah, roger that."]
 66: 1760| [47] [Yuuri]
 67: 1763| [45] ["Yay~ Breakfast~ breakfast~"]
 68: 1780| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro laid out breakfast for three on the table.]
 69: 1933| [47] [All 3]
 70: 1936| [45] ["Thanks for the food."]
 71: 1988| [45] [And thus another ordinary morning began.]
 72: 2098| [45] [After breakfast was over, Natsuhiko sighed.]
 73: 2106| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 2109| [45] ["... Phew, thanks for the food. I loved it."]
 75: 2135| [47] [Yuuri]
 76: 2138| [45] ["Me too~ It was delicious again today, Mashiron."]
 77: 2164| [47] [Mashiro]
 78: 2167| [45] ["Okay, then. Let's get to school. We lazed around a little too much."]
 79: 2235| [45] [Natsuhiko hustled to get himself ready for school.]
 80: 2342| [45] [And then he and Mashiro bade farewell to Yuuri.]
 81: 2350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 2353| [45] ["We'll be off then, Yuuri."]
 83: 2379| [47] [Mashiro]
 84: 2382| [45] ["Bye, Yuuri. See you later."]
 85: 2408| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 2411| [45] ["Okay, take care, you two~"]
 87: 2451| [45] [And with that voice at their backs, Natsuhiko turned on the lights and left.]
 88: 2588| [45] [And once they reached the bus stop to wait for the bus, Mashiro cheerfully mused.]
 89: 2681| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 2684| [45] ["Say, Natsuhiko. Shouldn't you be a little more excited to get to school today?"]
 91: 2692| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 2695| [45] ["Hm? Why's that?"]
 93: 2721| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 2724| [45] ["I mean, look. Yesterday you were able to use telepathy, remember?"]
 95: 2750| [47] [Mashiro]
 96: 2753| [45] ["You could tell the teachers so they can give you your 'Ability Level 1' certification, don't you think?"]
 97: 2761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 2764| [45] ["Oh... that."]
 99: 2843| [45] [True, yesterday, Natsuhiko did use telepathy at the scene of the accident, albeit just once.]
100: 2912| [45] [However, no matter how much he tried, he couldn't do it a second time.]
101: 2961| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 2964| [45] ["Well, sure, I may have used it once, but I don't feel like making a report just for that."]
103: 2990| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 2993| [45] ["If I reported it to the teachers, I'd have to take a level certification exam, wouldn't I?"]
105: 3105| [45] [Obtaining Ability Level 1 certification made tuition slightly cheaper.]
106: 3110| [45] [However, you had to perform several tests of telepathy ability in front of your homeroom teacher to obtain it.]
107: 3157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 3160| [45] ["Honestly, I'm not confident I could take it. Yesterday was just a fluke."]
109: 3232| [47] [Mashiro]
110: 3235| [45] ["Whaaat? You're giving up that easily?"]
111: 3261| [47] [Mashiro]
112: 3264| [45] ["Oh, I see. You just don't want to embarrass yourself in front of Ms. Ena."]
113: 3272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 3275| [45] ["Well, I guess there's that too. But more importantly, I'm not all that interested in ability levels."]
115: 3283| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 3286| [45] ["I don't care if I stay Ability Level 0 forever."]
117: 3312| [47] [Mashiro]
118: 3315| [45] ["Really? ... Well, if you say so."]
119: 3331| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 3334| [45] ["... What are you implying?"]
121: 3360| [47] [Mashiro]
122: 3363| [45] ["Huh? No, nothing... I mean I don't think there's any harm in using telepathy."]
123: 3390| [47] [Mashiro]
124: 3393| [45] ["And I was also thinking 'If only you could use psychic powers, you'd be able to bring smiles to everyone's faces.'"]
125: 3401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 3404| [45] ["What's that supposed to mean?"]
127: 3430| [47] [Mashiro]
128: 3433| [45] ["It's a line from the first episode of the 'Beyond*BEYOND Voice Drama' I bought yesterday."]
129: 3441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 3444| [45] ["Oh."]
131: 3449| [45] [Natsuhiko shrugged his shoulders.]
132: 3475| [45] [Mashiro shrugged her shoulders.]
133: 3550| [45] [And right around then, the bus arrived.]
134: 3604| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro boarded the bus and headed to school.]
