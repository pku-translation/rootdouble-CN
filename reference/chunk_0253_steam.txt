  1:   56| [45] [After Watase's team made another sweep of Area 5, they headed to the factory.]
  2:  105| [47] [Watase]
  3:  108| [45] ["No one here from what I can see..."]
  4:  185| [47] [Ukita]
  5:  188| [45] ["But there's also a possibility that Yuuri went running this way."]
  6:  214| [47] [Jun]
  7:  217| [45] ["Yeah, and we've also gotta find anything that can help us locate an escape route."]
  8:  222| [45] [They held that conversation as they headed to the small room with the cargo lift.]
  9:  335| [45] [Jun said she might be able to use her skillful handiwork to repair the control panel--]
 10:  340| [45] [But eventually, she concluded that it would be too difficult to repair.]
 11:  495| [47] [Jun]
 12:  498| [45] ["... I just don't have enough parts to fix it."]
 13:  524| [47] [Jun]
 14:  527| [45] ["The parts I need are just gone. Like the internal wiring was ripped out or something.%NIt would take a lot of time and effort just to fix it."]
 15:  532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  533| [45] [(That's right... Back then, I ripped it out so that Watase couldn't follow Mashiro, didn't I...)]
 17:  538| [45] [And since it was on Natsuhiko's person, which was currently in Area N, it was only obvious that repairs would be difficult.]
 18:  546| [47] [Watase]
 19:  549| [45] ["Okay... then let's consider the whole lift thing again after we've found the survivors."]
 20:  739| [45] [--No matter how much they searched Area 6, they found neither Salyu nor the girl.]
 21:  784| [45] [Watase and the others had no choice but to head to Area 1.]
 22:  854| [45] [Immediately afterwards, Watase's feet came to an abrupt stop.]
 23:  881| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  884| [45] ["Hmm? Is something the matter?"]
 25:  892| [47] [Watase]
 26:  895| [45] ["No... I just thought I heard someone's footsteps or something..."]
 27:  942| [47] [Jun]
 28:  945| [45] ["Huh!? From where!?"]
 29: 1034| [45] [They rushed to follow the sound of footsteps into the stairwell.]
 30: 1039| [45] [But what awaited them was--]
 31: 1177| [47] [Jun]
 32: 1180| [45] ["Captain, look out!!"]
 33: 1262| [47] [Jun]
 34: 1265| [45] ["Kah... agh!"]
 35: 1285| [45] [--a severe accident where falling debris injured Jun's back.]
 36: 1343| [45] [Once they carried Jun to a nearby office for first aid,]
 37: 1429| [47] [Ukita]
 38: 1432| [45] ["O... okay, Captain Kasasagi! Then I'll keep searching while you treat Moribe!"]
 39: 1452| [45] [Ukita dashed out of the room with that statement--]
 40: 1496| [45] [--and after finishing Jun's treatment, Watase resumed the search as well.]
