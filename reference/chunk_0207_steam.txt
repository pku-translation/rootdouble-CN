  0:  126| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 6]
  1:  172| [45] [--After a little while, they arrived at the school.]
  2:  177| [45] [The gate was open even though it was a Sunday.]
  3:  182| [45] [Perhaps to let in teachers looking to get work done on the day off, or to allow students to use the facilities for club activities.]
  4:  190| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  193| [45] ["Mr. Driver, please go to the staff entrance at the rear."]
  6:  198| [47] [Driver]
  7:  201| [45] ["Gladly~"]
  8:  236| [45] [The driver moved the car in accordance with Natsuhiko's directions.]
  9:  289| [45] [And then the kids got off the taxi at the staff entrance.]
 10:  297| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  300| [45] ["Mr. Driver, please wait here. We'll be back later."]
 12:  305| [47] [Driver]
 13:  308| [45] ["Well, you -are- renting for the day. Of course I'll wait."]
 14:  313| [45] [And with that voice at their backs, they entered the school.]
 15:  318| [45] [It was the same familiar school they attended, but they made sure to be as cautious as thieves.]
 16:  361| [45] [As they got inside, Salyu muttered.]
 17:  423| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  426| [45] ["Let's find Ena quick and--"]
 19:  434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  437| [45] ["Hold up, Salyu."]
 21:  442| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly stopped Salyu.]
 22:  468| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  471| [45] ["What's wrong?"]
 24:  479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  482| [45] ["Listen carefully. I can hear something from over there."]
 26:  487| [45] [Natsuhiko pointed to the corner of the ceiling as he spoke.]
 27:  492| [45] [And there--]
 28:  542| [45] [He could hear the servo motors of a surveillance camera.]
 29:  569| [47] [Salyu]
 30:  572| [45] ["There's a camera inside here too...!?"]
 31:  580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  583| [45] ["The school's furnished with surveillance cameras to prevent intrusion by suspicious characters."]
 33:  588| [45] [Natsuhiko normally paid them no heed.]
 34:  593| [45] [Because if he let their presence get to him every day, he'd never be able to stay calm.]
 35:  625| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  628| [45] ["... Then we can't go to the staff room."]
 37:  636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  639| [45] ["Yeah, but if we can find a dead spot--"]
 39:  644| [45] [As Natsuhiko began to speak, Mashiro placed a finger to her temple.]
 40:  677| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  680| [45] ["Hold on, guys, I'm contacting Ms. Ena through telepathy."]
 42:  706| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  709| [45] ["'Ms. Ena, this is an emergency. It's me, Mashiro Toba. If you're at school, please come to the staff entrance'."]
 44:  735| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  738| [45] ["It's more reliable to do this than to try moving around."]
 46:  746| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  749| [45] ["I see...! So let's wait here, then."]
 48:  797| [45] [And thus, they waited for a while after Mashiro sent her telepathy--]
 49:  802| [45] [--and eventually, Ena appeared.]
 50:  864| [47] [Ena]
 51:  867| [45] ["Ms. Toba!? Mr. Tenkawa and Ms. Sannomiya, too!?"]
 52:  894| [47] [Mashiro]
 53:  897| [45] ["Ah, Ms. Ena! I'm so glad you're here~...!"]
 54:  923| [47] [Ena]
 55:  926| [45] ["What's happened with you three? You come here on a Sunday with an emergency?"]
 56:  934| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  937| [45] ["It's a long story... Can we talk about it somewhere without surveillance cameras?"]
 58:  942| [45] [Ena watched Natsuhiko's tense entreaty with a serious look on her face.]
 59:  950| [47] [Ena]
 60:  953| [45] ["... Sounds like a desperate situation, huh."]
 61:  979| [47] [Ena]
 62:  982| [45] ["The BC room's right over there. It doesn't have any surveillance cameras. We can talk in there."]
 63: 1089| [45] [They slipped stealthily into the BC room.]
 64: 1094| [45] [Ena stood at her podium as usual and spoke up.]
 65: 1156| [47] [Ena]
 66: 1159| [45] ["--Now, let's hear it."]
 67: 1167| [47] [Ena]
 68: 1170| [45] ["You three have been acting strange since yesterday. What on earth happened?"]
 69: 1178| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1181| [45] ["I don't know if you'll believe us, but... we've been dragged into a bizarre incident."]
 71: 1207| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1210| [45] ["We wanted some advice, so we looked for you, Ms. Ena."]
 73: 1236| [47] [Ena]
 74: 1239| [45] ["Incident? Advice? What might this all be about?"]
 75: 1247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1250| [45] ["Well, I guess we should start from the beginning..."]
 77: 1255| [45] [Natsuhiko retold the story of what happened since yesterday.]
 78: 1260| [45] [What happened on the bus, the possibility of Q being in the city, and the reason the security department was chasing them.]
 79: 1265| [45] [Though he did leave out the part about Mashiro using empathy.]
 80: 1270| [45] [Once the story was done-- Ena muttered.]
 81: 1296| [47] [Ena]
 82: 1299| [45] ["... I see, so that's what happened..."]
 83: 1325| [47] [Mashiro]
 84: 1328| [45] ["Ms. Ena, you believe us!?"]
 85: 1354| [47] [Ena]
 86: 1357| [45] ["Yes. You are my students, so I believe what you say."]
 87: 1383| [47] [Ena]
 88: 1386| [45] ["And I believe you kids acted in accordance with a pure sense of justice."]
 89: 1391| [45] [The kids were about to sigh in relief, but what Ena said next stopped them in their tracks.]
 90: 1417| [47] [Ena]
 91: 1420| [45] ["... But for that very reason, I don't think you should involve yourselves in this incident any further."]
 92: 1428| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1431| [45] ["No way...! Why not!?"]
 94: 1457| [47] [Ena]
 95: 1460| [45] ["As a teacher, there's no way I can approve of students putting themselves in danger, can I?"]
 96: 1486| [47] [Ena]
 97: 1489| [45] ["Q is just that dangerous an organization."]
 98: 1497| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1500| [45] ["Professor, you know about Q?"]
100: 1526| [47] [Ena]
101: 1529| [45] ["Of course I do. I am a teacher at Rokumei Academy, you know."]
102: 1534| [45] [Apparently Mashiro and the trainer were right. It did appear to be an infamous organization. However--]
103: 1560| [47] [Mashiro]
104: 1563| [45] ["So why are you being so...?"]
105: 1568| [45] [As Mashiro trailed off on her words, Ena spoke with an exasperated smile on her face.]
106: 1594| [47] [Ena]
107: 1597| [45] ["... Right. If I want you kids to understand where I'm coming from... it looks like a special lesson is in order."]
108: 1605| [47] [Ena]
109: 1608| [45] ["It's not something I teach in normal lectures, but I do believe it's something you three should know."]
110: 1616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1619| [45] ["A special lesson?"]
112: 1624| [45] [Ena nodded and quietly began to speak.]
113: 1687| [47] [Ena]
114: 1690| [45] ["--The truth is that BC and terrorism share an inseparable relationship."]
115: 1698| [47] [Ena]
116: 1701| [45] ["While I was studying parapsychology in college, I naturally learned the true history of BC."]
117: 1709| [47] [Ena]
118: 1712| [45] ["Society underwent many changes after the emergence of Communicators..."]
119: 1738| [47] [Ena]
120: 1741| [45] ["It's a history steeped in danger and extreme instability."]
121: 1749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 1752| [45] ["A history steeped in danger...?"]
123: 1778| [47] [Ena]
124: 1781| [45] ["As you know, sixteen years ago was a turning point with the explosive increase in the number of Communicators worldwide, correct?"]
125: 1789| [47] [Ena]
126: 1792| [45] ["But do you think society at the time just simply accepted it?"]
127: 1800| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1803| [45] ["You mean... it didn't?"]
129: 1836| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 1839| [45] ["Yeah. I thought Communicators only had low ability levels back then. They knew that some people could use a bit of telepathy and that was it..."]
131: 1874| [47] [Ena]
132: 1877| [45] ["The espers probably didn't think it was that big a deal. But not everyone else believed that, necessarily."]
133: 1882| [45] [Ena frowned as she spoke.]
134: 1908| [47] [Ena]
135: 1911| [45] ["At first, only a small minority of people displayed intense rejection of Communicators."]
136: 1919| [47] [Ena]
137: 1922| [45] ["There was an incident in France in February 2014. Men obsessed with some delusion set fire to a village a Communicator lived in."]
138: 1930| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1933| [45] ["Fire...!?"]
140: 1966| [47] [Mashiro]
141: 1969| [45] ["That's terrible! Why!?"]
142: 2004| [47] [Ena]
143: 2007| [45] ["According to the arsonists, it was 'because Communicators are abominations possessed by impure spirits.'"]
144: 2040| [47] [Salyu]
145: 2043| [45] ["Impure spirits? What's that supposed to mean?"]
146: 2078| [47] [Ena]
147: 2081| [45] ["Apparently there's this story in the Bible."]
148: 2089| [47] [Ena]
149: 2092| [45] ["--By the shore of the Sea of Galilee, there was a man possessed by impure spirits."]
150: 2100| [47] [Ena]
151: 2103| [45] ["He dwelled by the tombs and would often hear the spirits' voice and suffer."]
152: 2111| [47] [Ena]
153: 2114| [45] ["When asked for his name, the man replied,"]
154: 2122| [47] [Ena]
155: 2125| [45] ["'My name is Legion. For we are many.'"]
156: 2133| [47] [Ena]
157: 2136| [45] ["The impure spirits were eventually exorcised from the man's body and instead they entered a nearby herd of pigs."]
158: 2144| [47] [Ena]
159: 2147| [45] ["Upon which, the pigs began to run like mad and fell into the lake one by one, where they drowned..."]
160: 2155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 2158| [45] ["... That's quite an ominous story. What's up with that?"]
162: 2166| [47] [Ena]
163: 2169| [45] ["I don't know. The significance behind that story has always been a subject of discussion among religious scholars, apparently."]
164: 2195| [47] [Ena]
165: 2198| [45] ["But this is what the arsonists thought:"]
166: 2206| [47] [Ena]
167: 2209| [45] ["'Communicators hear voices that we do not. Those are the voices of impure spirits.'"]
168: 2217| [47] [Ena]
169: 2220| [45] ["'They are abominations possessed by impure spirits. And therefore, they must be punished by God.'"]
170: 2253| [47] [Mashiro]
171: 2256| [45] ["No way...!"]
172: 2264| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 2267| [45] ["... That's crazy."]
174: 2302| [47] [Ena]
175: 2305| [45] ["Indeed. I think so too."]
176: 2331| [47] [Ena]
177: 2334| [45] ["Of course, those arsonists were punished and fortunately, there were no casualties. Thus the incident was soon forgotten."]
178: 2342| [47] [Ena]
179: 2345| [45] ["But in retrospect, that was the beginning. The start of the antagonism between Communicators and ordinary people."]
180: 2350| [45] [Ena's expression remained unchanged.]
181: 2355| [45] [But her voice gradually grew more stern.]
182: 2363| [47] [Ena]
183: 2366| [45] ["Communicators were targeted by normal people for the sole fact that they were Communicators-- and those incidents only increased in frequency afterwards."]
184: 2374| [47] [Ena]
185: 2377| [45] ["In April that same year, a young American Communicator was lynched in Brooklyn."]
186: 2385| [47] [Ena]
187: 2388| [45] ["The following month, an entire apartment building was burned to the ground in China."]
188: 2396| [47] [Ena]
189: 2399| [45] ["In June, it was Germany. In July, Italy and America."]
190: 2407| [47] [Ena]
191: 2410| [45] ["In August, it was Germany, France, and Austria.%NIn September, it was Russia, France, America, and China..."]
192: 2418| [47] [Ena]
193: 2421| [45] ["I had my hands full just counting all of the similar incidents."]
194: 2447| [47] [Ena]
195: 2450| [45] ["Did you know it's happened in this very town too? The 'Great Rokumei City Arson'..."]
196: 2483| [47] [Mashiro]
197: 2486| [45] ["I-I know about that!"]
198: 2521| [47] [Ena]
199: 2524| [45] ["Yes, you're a good learner, Ms. Toba. It's not a very well talked about incident nowadays."]
200: 2529| [45] [Ena spoke with a smile.]
201: 2534| [45] [But it was a smile tinged with sadness.]
202: 2560| [47] [Ena]
203: 2563| [45] ["... These problems never happened back when Communicators were extremely few in number and BC was dismissed as the occult."]
204: 2571| [47] [Ena]
205: 2574| [45] ["I do believe there were Communicators before that, but at best, the options available to them were to become leaders of new age religions, to work as TV talents--"]
206: 2582| [47] [Ena]
207: 2585| [45] ["Or to hide their abilities as most of them did, and live in secret."]
208: 2593| [47] [Ena]
209: 2596| [45] ["But as Communicators started appearing more and more and their numbers rapidly grew,%Nthe situation instantly intensified."]
210: 2604| [47] [Ena]
211: 2607| [45] ["It was as if all of the sudden a new breed of humans was born, and many people feared the demise of the old human race."]
212: 2615| [47] [Ena]
213: 2618| [45] ["It would've been fine if BC were something you could just learn if you put in the effort,%Nbut since BC aptitude is genetic and decided upon birth, well..."]
214: 2623| [45] [Ena trailed off at that, allowing silence to fill the classroom.]
215: 2628| [45] [Even though the room temperature wasn't that cold, Natsuhiko felt his spine chill.]
216: 2633| [45] [A strange fear sank into his heart.]
217: 2638| [45] [Ena continued.]
218: 2664| [47] [Ena]
219: 2667| [45] ["... That antagonism eventually turned into fear. And that fear gave birth to terrorism."]
220: 2693| [47] [Ena]
221: 2696| [45] ["Terrorism is derived from the Latin word 'terror', after all."]
222: 2704| [47] [Ena]
223: 2707| [45] ["People resort to terrorism either when they fear others or when they want others to fear them."]
224: 2733| [47] [Ena]
225: 2736| [45] ["It's a sad, but inevitable course of events."]
226: 2744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 2747| [45] ["I... I don't believe it..."]
228: 2780| [47] [Mashiro]
229: 2783| [45] ["But aren't we at peace now...!?"]
230: 2818| [47] [Ena]
231: 2821| [45] ["It took an extraordinary international effort to build that peace. And of course, Japan was part of that effort."]
232: 2829| [47] [Ena]
233: 2832| [45] ["Two years after the Great Rokumei City Arson, the 'BC Law' was enacted to protect Communicators."]
234: 2840| [47] [Ena]
235: 2843| [45] ["And at the same time, six cities in Japan were established as 'government designated top secret cities', protective wards for Communicators, beginning here with Rokumei City."]
236: 2851| [47] [Ena]
237: 2854| [45] ["Communicators throughout the country were moved into these government designated top secret cities."]
238: 2862| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 2865| [45] ["They were moved...? You mean they had no choice?"]
240: 2891| [47] [Ena]
241: 2894| [45] ["No, it was at its core, voluntary. But Communicators living in the countryside received insistent advice from the government to move."]
242: 2902| [47] [Ena]
243: 2905| [45] ["Of course, the government reimbursed the full amount to move and even provided anything from occupation and housing referrals to large reserve funds on a case by case basis."]
244: 2913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 2916| [45] ["Why would the government go that far?"]
246: 2942| [47] [Ena]
247: 2945| [45] ["To preserve public order. Nothing more. They wanted to defuse the antagonism between Communicators and ordinary people."]
248: 2953| [47] [Ena]
249: 2956| [45] ["The urgent matter at hand was to establish the idea that 'Communicators all live in government designated top secret cities' as common sense."]
250: 2964| [47] [Ena]
251: 2967| [45] ["By segregating the Communicators, the ordinary people would be able to rest peacefully."]
252: 2993| [47] [Ena]
253: 2996| [45] ["The migration went over smoothly, and friction was minimized."]
254: 3004| [47] [Ena]
255: 3007| [45] ["And so, with all its Communicators gathered in one spot, Japan was able to get its BC research organized for undisturbed progression, and thus became an advanced BC nation."]
256: 3015| [47] [Ena]
257: 3018| [45] ["... So basically, this town isn't merely a research city."]
258: 3026| [47] [Ena]
259: 3029| [45] ["It's a national fortress established by the state to protect Communicators like you."]
260: 3037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 3040| [45] ["...!"]
262: 3045| [45] [When he heard the story to its end, Natsuhiko finally understood the truth behind this town.]
263: 3050| [45] [Why this town had such strong public order.]
264: 3055| [45] [Why the city was so vigilant against criminal activity, to the point of installing surveillance cameras and city gates.]
265: 3060| [45] [He heard that it was all to protect the local research facilities from industrial espionage, but--]
266: 3065| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 3066| [45] [(Were they actually trying to protect the Communicators...? No, "the public order of society" itself?)]
268: 3071| [45] [Ena continued as the kids were left speechless.]
269: 3097| [47] [Ena]
270: 3100| [45] ["... But the more society's systems strengthened, the more crafty the terrorists became."]
271: 3126| [47] [Ena]
272: 3129| [45] ["And Q was the most crafty and vindictive organization of them all."]
273: 3137| [47] [Ena]
274: 3140| [45] ["You may know this already, but they have successfully carried out terrorism in the past."]
275: 3166| [47] [Ena]
276: 3169| [45] ["As of yet, there haven't been any cases of them targeting government designated top secret cities, but I don't for a moment think your story is a joke, kids."]
277: 3174| [45] [Ena quietly sighed.]
278: 3179| [45] [It appeared that the reason she honestly believed their story was because it was a possibility she had feared from the start.]
279: 3212| [47] [Salyu]
280: 3215| [45] ["... I understand that Q is a dangerous organization."]
281: 3241| [47] [Salyu]
282: 3244| [45] ["But why hasn't the police arrested them?"]
283: 3270| [47] [Ena]
284: 3273| [45] ["That's because for the most part, Q's members consist of 'ordinary people' who happen to be in the area of the operation."]
285: 3290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
286: 3293| [45] ["Ordinary people?"]
287: 3301| [47] [Ena]
288: 3304| [45] ["Unlike extremist groups and town guerrillas of the past, Q doesn't make grandiose claims of its existence."]
289: 3312| [47] [Ena]
290: 3315| [45] ["And of course, they don't have any sort of hideout where they practice armed combat or anything."]
291: 3323| [47] [Ena]
292: 3326| [45] ["They merely use their proprietary network to search for ordinary people who dislike Communicators and then they slowly convince those people to join their cause."]
293: 3334| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 3337| [45] ["But if the terrorists solicit, won't they get caught right away...?"]
295: 3363| [47] [Ena]
296: 3366| [45] ["No. When they solicit like-minded people, they use various different names for camouflage."]
297: 3374| [47] [Ena]
298: 3377| [45] ["Bland names like 'The Association for Consideration of Relations with Communicators'."]
299: 3385| [47] [Ena]
300: 3388| [45] ["But once they join those camouflage organizations, the members themselves don't realize that they've actually joined Q."]
301: 3414| [47] [Ena]
302: 3417| [45] ["The majority of its own members don't understand the truth of the organization. The name Q itself is nothing more than a designation given for convenience."]
303: 3425| [47] [Ena]
304: 3428| [45] ["That's why it's hard for the police to make arrests."]
305: 3436| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 3439| [45] ["... Is that how it works?"]
307: 3444| [45] [That seemed to be the reason why Natsuhiko hadn't even heard of the name Q until just a few days ago.]
308: 3449| [45] [Because Q was a unique kind of terrorist organization-- one whose very structure was ambiguous.]
309: 3482| [47] [Mashiro]
310: 3485| [45] ["But Q's top brass are working solely to commit terrorism though, right?"]
311: 3511| [47] [Ena]
312: 3514| [45] ["Of course. The top brass have been pulling off terrorist acts for years by going through their countless subordinate members and selecting the ones most suitable to take the fall as the perpetrators."]
313: 3522| [47] [Ena]
314: 3525| [45] ["Oftentimes they choose staff members with connections to the target buildings to be the perpetrators."]
315: 3533| [47] [Ena]
316: 3536| [45] ["The use of such sleeper agents increases the success rate of their terrorist acts."]
317: 3562| [47] [Ena]
318: 3565| [45] ["What supports their unity and belief is a hatred of the unknown."]
319: 3573| [47] [Ena]
320: 3576| [45] ["The mere thought that 'they're not like us' is enough to incite them to hate others, ostracize them, injure them, and finally set towns ablaze. Their mentality is abnormal...!"]
321: 3584| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 3587| [45] ["There are people like that in the world...!?"]
323: 3668| [45] [Natsuhiko's very core shuddered to hear the entire story.]
324: 3673| [45] [Not once in his life did he expect there to be people who hated Communicators like him to that extent.]
325: 3678| [47] [Natsuhiko]
326: 3679| [45] [(We've never even met. We've never even done anything wrong...!)]
327: 3684| [45] [--That was when Natsuhiko first knew.]
328: 3689| [45] [That the world was full of malice.]
329: 3694| [45] [A peaceful life was not a given, but rather something narrowly established on a precarious balance.]
330: 3699| [45] [As the kids cast their eyes downward at this newfound truth, Ena spoke to them gently.]
331: 3761| [47] [Ena]
332: 3764| [45] ["... I'm sorry. It must be a shock."]
333: 3772| [47] [Ena]
334: 3775| [45] ["The ugly truth of society and the existence of genuine malice should be things left for you to find out when you grow up."]
335: 3783| [47] [Ena]
336: 3786| [45] ["That's why the school doesn't teach those things. It would give needless anxiety to the students and surely spread the seeds of antagonism, too."]
337: 3794| [47] [Ena]
338: 3797| [45] ["This town polices information and filters the internet... Though, honestly, if you looked into it, you could still find out about Q's existence and whatnot."]
339: 3802| [45] [That did seem like an obvious decision on the school's part.]
340: 3807| [45] [If the school instilled the fear of ordinary people into the minds of all the Communicators who attended, then the cycle of antagonism would never end.]
341: 3833| [47] [Ena]
342: 3836| [45] ["... But you know, I thought that you three would be able to accept that truth calmly."]
343: 3844| [47] [Ena]
344: 3847| [45] ["Ms. Toba, the most diligent of the class. Ms. Sannomiya, the wisest of the class.%NAnd Mr. Tenkawa, the one with the highest aptitude in the class..."]
345: 3855| [47] [Ena]
346: 3858| [45] ["You're a mismatched trio, but that's why the three of you together can come to terms with this truth, right?"]
347: 3866| [47] [Natsuhiko]
348: 3869| [45] ["O... of course!"]
349: 3896| [47] [Mashiro]
350: 3899| [45] ["Yeah! We're not the type to lose heart to some dumb malice like that or whatever!"]
351: 3927| [47] [Salyu]
352: 3930| [45] ["I've promised that even in the off chance something does happen, I will protect these two."]
353: 3956| [47] [Ena]
354: 3959| [45] ["I see. I'm glad I told you then. So..."]
355: 3964| [45] [Ena smiled sweetly-- and then she spoke clearly and distinctly.]
356: 3990| [47] [Ena]
357: 3993| [45] ["Leave the rest up to the adults. You kids should behave and just stay put."]
358: 4034| [47] [Natsuhiko]
359: 4037| [45] ["... Huh?"]
360: 4063| [47] [Ena]
361: 4066| [45] ["I heard from the security department and the police after yesterday's bomb threat."]
362: 4074| [47] [Ena]
363: 4077| [45] ["They're already considering the possibility of terrorism. That's why the city's under martial law."]
364: 4085| [47] [Ena]
365: 4088| [45] ["If terrorism happens in this city now, it could shatter a system ten-odd years in the making."]
366: 4114| [47] [Ena]
367: 4117| [45] ["It might be harsh of me to say this, but it'll just be a hindrance for kids to be moving back and forth."]
368: 4125| [47] [Ena]
369: 4128| [45] ["I'm sure the security department thinks so too, which is why they're trying to take you into protective custody."]
370: 4136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
371: 4139| [45] ["But... you're telling us to just sit back and do nothing?"]
372: 4165| [47] [Mashiro]
373: 4168| [45] ["We can't! The whole city could be in danger! Are you just going to watch as it happens, Ms. Ena!?"]
374: 4194| [47] [Ena]
375: 4197| [45] ["... I know. But I'm not just going to watch."]
376: 4205| [47] [Ena]
377: 4208| [45] ["This town's so beautiful, it just makes you want to protect it."]
378: 4280| [47] [Ena]
379: 4283| [45] ["Even if there really is a hole in its perfect surveillance system... the town is precious to its townspeople."]
380: 4288| [45] [As she spoke, Ena glanced at the classroom door.]
381: 4314| [47] [Ena]
382: 4317| [45] ["But even so, you three need to head home now. And if the security department people show up, you should follow their instructions."]
383: 4325| [47] [Ena]
384: 4328| [45] ["That's the number one thing you three should do for now."]
385: 4333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
386: 4334| [45] ["..."]
387: 4348| [45] [Natsuhiko felt irritated.]
388: 4353| [45] [He could tell Ena was worried about both them and the city.]
389: 4358| [45] [And yet in the end, her opinion still didn't mesh with theirs?]
390: 4363| [47] [Natsuhiko]
391: 4364| [45] [(Dammit, we need to persuade her somehow...! There has to be some way we can convince her.)]
392: 4372| [45] [Natsuhiko felt a little lonely.]
393: 4377| [45] [Ena acknowledged what they had to say, but in the end, she still treated them like children.]
394: 4382| [45] [Regardless of their student-teacher relationship--]
395: 4387| [45] [Her way of thinking sided with the adults, the security department, if anything.]
396: 4392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
397: 4393| [45] [(Dammit... Is there nothing we can do?)]
398: 4398| [47] [Natsuhiko]
399: 4399| [45] [(Is there no way we can get Prof. Tsubakiyama on our side...!?)]
400: 4404| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko pondered that question, Mashiro suddenly spoke up.]
401: 4430| [47] [Mashiro]
402: 4433| [45] ["I... I understand, Ms. Ena. We'll do as you say."]
403: 4441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
404: 4444| [45] ["Huh?"]
405: 4449| [45] [Natsuhiko was surprised, but Ena spoke in relief.]
406: 4475| [47] [Ena]
407: 4478| [45] ["Thank you. It makes me happy as a teacher to have such obedient students."]
408: 4504| [47] [Mashiro]
409: 4507| [45] ["It's... it's because I've always respected you, Ms. Ena."]
410: 4533| [47] [Mashiro]
411: 4536| [45] ["Okay, Natsuhiko. Salyu. Let's go."]
412: 4544| [47] [Natsuhiko]
413: 4547| [45] ["No, hold on a second Mashiro. It's a little too sudden for you to just say---"]
414: 4573| [47] [Mashiro]
415: 4576| [45] ["Just come."]
416: 4581| [45] [At around the same time Mashiro said that, she used telepathy.]
417: 4640| [85] [{Don't say anything, guys.]
418: 4642| [85] [I'll explain the situation once we're outside. Let's just run away for now.}]
419: 4643| [86] [Mashiro]
420: 4644| [86] [{Don't say anything, guys. I'll explain the situation once we're outside. Let's just run away for now.}]
421: 4680| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko heard that message, he couldn't stop himself from raising his voice.]
422: 4688| [47] [Natsuhiko]
423: 4691| [45] ["Run away!? ... From what?"]
424: 4752| [47] [Mashiro]
425: 4755| [45] ["!!"]
426: 4781| [47] [Ena]
427: 4784| [45] ["Huh?"]
428: 4789| [45] [Ena gave a stern expression for a second. Mashiro got flustered and waved her hand.]
429: 4815| [47] [Mashiro]
430: 4818| [45] ["N-nothing!"]
431: 4844| [47] [Mashiro]
432: 4847| [45] ["C'mon, let's go, guys!"]
433: 4855| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 4858| [45] ["R-right."]
435: 4884| [47] [Salyu]
436: 4887| [45] ["... Roger."]
437: 4892| [45] [Before Natsuhiko and Salyu could understand what was going on, Mashiro led them out.]
438: 4897| [47] [Ena]
439: 4898| [45] ["..."]
440: 4903| [45] [They left Ena alone with a dubious expression on her face--]
441: 4912| [47] [Natsuhiko]
442: 4915| [45] ["!?"]
443: 4920| [45] [What exactly did she mean by "run away"?]
444: 4925| [45] [Natsuhiko was bewildered, but one look at Mashiro's tense expression stopped him from asking her.]
445: 4933| [47] [Natsuhiko]
446: 4936| [45] ["Y-yeah, okay..."]
447: 4962| [47] [Salyu]
448: 4965| [45] ["... Roger."]
449: 4970| [45] [Mashiro nodded and then spoke to Ena.]
450: 4996| [47] [Mashiro]
451: 4999| [45] ["Okay, if you'll excuse us, Ms. Ena."]
452: 5025| [47] [Ena]
453: 5028| [45] ["I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful."]
454: 5033| [45] [They left Ena alone in the classroom with an apologetic look on her face.]
455: 5161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
456: 5164| [45] ["Hey, Mashiro, what did you mean by 'run away'?"]
457: 5190| [47] [Mashiro]
458: 5193| [45] ["Shh!"]
459: 5198| [45] [Mashiro shushed him and answered with telepathy.]
460: 5255| [85] [{We can't trust Ms. Ena.}]
461: 5256| [86] [Mashiro]
462: 5257| [86] [{We can't trust Ms. Ena.}]
463: 5272| [85] [{... She's not opening her heart to us.}]
464: 5273| [86] [Mashiro]
465: 5274| [86] [{... She's not opening her heart to us.}]
466: 5305| [47] [Natsuhiko]
467: 5308| [45] ["!?"]
468: 5351| [47] [Salyu]
469: 5354| [45] ["What does that mean?"]
470: 5411| [85] [{When she finished talking, Ms. Ena seemed oddly obstinate, didn't she?}]
471: 5412| [86] [Mashiro]
472: 5413| [86] [{When she finished talking, Ms. Ena seemed oddly obstinate, didn't she?}]
473: 5448| [85] [{So I tried to see if I could use empathy on her,]
474: 5450| [85] [but...}]
475: 5451| [86] [Mashiro]
476: 5452| [86] [{So I tried to see if I could use empathy on her, but...}]
477: 5487| [85] [{I couldn't hear her mental voice at all. That's proof she isn't opening her heart.}]
478: 5488| [86] [Mashiro]
479: 5489| [86] [{I couldn't hear her mental voice at all. That's proof she isn't opening her heart.}]
480: 5517| [45] [Mashiro's eyes were blurred with sadness.]
481: 5525| [47] [Natsuhiko]
482: 5528| [45] ["... No way..."]
483: 5533| [45] [The smile he saw on Ena's face just now flickered in the back of Natsuhiko's head.]
484: 5538| [45] [It was such a kind smile by appearances, and yet--]
485: 5543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
486: 5544| [45] [(Did Prof. Tsubakiyama not actually trust us...?)]
487: 5549| [45] [He couldn't understand why not. But he could smell danger somewhere.]
488: 5624| [85] [{If we stay here too long, she could call the security department on us...}]
489: 5625| [86] [Mashiro]
490: 5626| [86] [{If we stay here too long, she could call the security department on us...}]
491: 5641| [85] [{Let's get out of here calmly, but quickly.}]
492: 5642| [86] [Mashiro]
493: 5643| [86] [{Let's get out of here calmly, but quickly.}]
494: 5674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
495: 5677| [45] ["... Yeah."]
496: 5682| [45] [The kids walked down the hallway trying to look as casual as they could.]
497: 5687| [45] [Nimbly passing through surveillance camera dead spots all the while.]
498: 5713| [47] [Salyu]
499: 5716| [45] ["... So, where do we go next?"]
500: 5742| [47] [Mashiro]
501: 5745| [45] ["We're in a tight spot, huh... Since we can't find Mr. Ukita, we're out of adults we can trust."]
502: 5753| [47] [Natsuhiko]
503: 5756| [45] ["Hmm..."]
504: 5761| [45] [Natsuhiko pondered Mashiro's observation.]
505: 5766| [45] [And he noticed that he did have one person in mind.]
506: 5792| [47] [Mashiro]
507: 5795| [45] ["... What's up, Natsuhiko? Did you think of someone?"]
508: 5803| [47] [Natsuhiko]
509: 5806| [45] ["Well, kinda... But we're barely acquainted, though."]
510: 5832| [47] [Salyu]
511: 5835| [45] ["Who?"]
512: 5843| [47] [Natsuhiko]
513: 5846| [45] ["Someone both you and Salyu know."]
514: 5872| [47] [Salyu]
515: 5875| [45] ["...?"]
516: 5901| [47] [Mashiro]
517: 5904| [45] ["... Ah!"]
518: 5909| [45] [It seemed to finally click for Mashiro when he said that.]
519: 5917| [47] [Natsuhiko]
520: 5920| [45] ["Yeah, when you've been cornered... I guess it really is a hero that you need."]
521: 5925| [45] [And with that, the kids left the school.]
522: 5989| [45] [As they boarded the taxi, the driver asked them,]
523: 5994| [47] [Driver]
524: 5997| [45] ["Where are you headed next?"]
525: 6005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
526: 6008| [45] ["The fire station."]
527: 6013| [45] [The driver nodded and began to input their next destination.]
