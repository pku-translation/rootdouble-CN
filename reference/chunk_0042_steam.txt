  1:   87| [45] [The group opened the security gate and went through the connecting passageway.]
  2:   93| [45] [The Procyon's alarm didn't go off, meaning they didn't have to worry about radiation here.]
  3:  136| [45] [And when they cleared the passageway--]
  4:  317| [45] [They found themselves face to face with a bizarre room.]
  5:  325| [47] [Watase]
  6:  328| [45] ["...!?"]
  7:  333| [45] [Watase was speechless at the sight he was staring at.]
  8:  338| [45] [The room was more like something out of a factory instead of a research facility.]
  9:  343| [45] [Large machines, forklifts, cranes, and mountains of materials were lined up.]
 10:  387| [45] [The ceiling was also much higher than it was in the other areas.]
 11:  392| [45] [It appeared that the room covered both B1 and B2.]
 12:  435| [45] [A catwalk surrounded the B1 area and encircled the entire floor.]
 13:  482| [47] [Watase]
 14:  485| [45] ["What the hell is this place...!?"]
 15:  519| [47] [Ukita]
 16:  522| [45] ["This is the development block, nicknamed the 'Factory'."]
 17:  548| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  551| [45] ["This is my first time here too... but I never imagined the damage would be this bad."]
 19:  584| [45] [The machines there had been burned to hell and back, just as Ukita said.]
 20:  589| [45] [The ladder leading up to the catwalks had been warped horribly, leaving them unreachable.]
 21:  597| [47] [Watase]
 22:  600| [45] ["Looks like the fire here was really bad..."]
 23:  605| [45] [Just as Watase muttered that--]
 24:  710| [45] [Something that looked like sand fell down from the ceiling.]
 25:  753| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  756| [45] ["It looks like the ceiling's collapsing too, doesn't it... Be careful everyone, it's still a bit dangerous."]
 27:  761| [45] [Jun then checked her Procyon.]
 28:  769| [47] [Jun]
 29:  772| [45] ["The reading is-- '3711 mSv'. Still within the safety standard."]
 30:  849| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  852| [45] ["Now then, this factory is quite big and it appears to be in complete shambles, so... why don't we split into teams of 4 and 2?"]
 32:  860| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  863| [45] ["The team of four will search the factory, while the team of two will search the inner ring."]
 34:  868| [45] [No one offered any objections to that proposal.]
 35:  876| [47] [Watase]
 36:  879| [45] ["Okay, then I'll take care of the search of the inner ring."]
 37:  884| [45] [Watase then thought about who he should pair up with--]
 38:  948| [45] [But he couldn't make up his mind.]
 39:  974| [47] [Jun]
 40:  977| [45] ["What's wrong, Captain? Hurry up and pick someone already."]
 41:  985| [47] [Watase]
 42:  988| [45] ["R-right..."]
 43:  993| [45] [Watase nodded and looked over the members of the group one more time.]
 44:  998| [47] [Watase]
 45:  999| [45] [(I should probably go for a good balance of gender and ability. Having a team of all men or one of only civilians would be a bad idea...)]
 46: 1093| [47] [Watase]
 47: 1096| [45] ["... Tachibana, will you join me?"]
 48: 1122| [47] [Kazami]
 49: 1125| [45] ["Of course. Roger that."]
 50: 1130| [45] [Kazami readily accepted Watase's proposal.]
 51: 1135| [45] [She probably didn't want to waste time talking.]
 52: 1179| [47] [Watase]
 53: 1182| [45] ["Moribe, I'm counting on you and your team to search the factory."]
 54: 1208| [47] [Jun]
 55: 1211| [45] ["Roger."]
 56: 1237| [47] [Kazami]
 57: 1240| [45] ["Then let's commence the search right away."]
 58: 1245| [45] [With Kazami's command as the trigger, the group split up into their teams.]
 59: 1352| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1355| [45] ["... Moribe, will you join me?"]
 61: 1381| [47] [Jun]
 62: 1384| [45] ["Sounds nice. Don't change what ain't broken, right?"]
 63: 1428| [47] [Kazami]
 64: 1431| [45] ["Then please leave the search of the factory to us."]
 65: 1439| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1442| [45] ["Okay, let's get to searching, people."]
 67: 1450| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1453| [45] ["Roger."]
 69: 1458| [45] [With Watase's command as the trigger, the group split up into their teams.]
 70: 1565| [47] [Watase]
 71: 1568| [45] ["... Teach, will you join me?"]
 72: 1594| [47] [Ena]
 73: 1597| [45] ["Oh, wasn't expecting that."]
 74: 1623| [47] [Ena]
 75: 1626| [45] ["Sure, whatever, I'm good with it."]
 76: 1631| [45] [Ena readily accepted Watase's proposal.]
 77: 1636| [45] [She probably didn't want to waste time talking.]
 78: 1680| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1683| [45] ["Tachibana, do you think it's okay with just me and Teach on our own?"]
 80: 1691| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1694| [45] ["... Good question. Well, your instincts seem to have more or less come back to you, so it should be all right."]
 82: 1702| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1705| [45] ["Good, then let's start the search, people."]
 84: 1710| [45] [With Watase's command as the trigger, the group split up into their teams.]
 85: 1818| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1821| [45] ["... Yuuri, will you join me?"]
 87: 1847| [47] [Yuuri]
 88: 1850| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
 89: 1894| [47] [Jun]
 90: 1897| [45] ["Whoa there, Captain, that'd be a really unbalanced team."]
 91: 1905| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1908| [45] ["Oh, really? I thought it was a good idea..."]
 93: 1936| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1939| [45] ["Is this really the time to be stalling over who goes to what team? Fine, I'll decide.%NMoribe, you're with the captain. There."]
 95: 1965| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1968| [45] ["Roger. C'mon Captain, that inner ring ain't gonna search itself!"]
 97: 1976| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1979| [45] ["Y-yeah, okay."]
 99: 1984| [45] [With Watase and Jun walking off as the trigger, the group split into their teams.]
100: 2092| [47] [Watase]
101: 2095| [45] ["... Hey old man, will you join me?"]
102: 2121| [47] [Ukita]
103: 2124| [45] ["Huh? O-oh... I don't particularly mind, but--"]
104: 2129| [45] [Ena cut in before Ukita could finish that thought.]
105: 2173| [47] [Ena]
106: 2176| [45] ["Hold on. I'll team up with Captain Kasasagi."]
107: 2202| [47] [Ukita]
108: 2205| [45] ["What?"]
109: 2231| [47] [Ena]
110: 2234| [45] ["Well? You don't mind, right, Captain Kasasagi?"]
111: 2242| [47] [Watase]
112: 2245| [45] ["N-not at all... you okay with that, old man?"]
113: 2271| [47] [Ukita]
114: 2274| [45] ["Sure, I'm good either way..."]
115: 2300| [47] [Ena]
116: 2303| [45] ["Then it's decided, isn't it?"]
117: 2331| [47] [Watase]
118: 2334| [45] ["Tachibana, do you think it's okay with just me and Teach on our own?"]
119: 2342| [47] [Kazami]
120: 2345| [45] ["... Good question. Well, your instincts seem to have more or less come back to you, so it should be all right."]
121: 2353| [47] [Watase]
122: 2356| [45] ["Good, then let's start the search, people."]
123: 2361| [45] [With Watase's command as the trigger, the group split up into their teams.]
124: 2421| [45] [--But in the end, he still couldn't make up his mind.]
125: 2447| [47] [Jun]
126: 2450| [45] ["Uh, Captain? 'Really should be hurrying up now."]
127: 2478| [47] [Ena]
128: 2481| [45] ["She's right. Don't you get that there's no time?"]
129: 2489| [47] [Watase]
130: 2492| [45] ["Y-yeah, but..."]
131: 2518| [47] [Kazami]
132: 2521| [45] ["Haah... If you can't make up your mind, then I have no choice."]
133: 2547| [47] [Kazami]
134: 2550| [45] ["Captain, you're with me. I take it you have no objections to that?"]
135: 2558| [47] [Watase]
136: 2561| [45] ["N-no, I don't..."]
137: 2587| [47] [Kazami]
138: 2590| [45] ["Then let's commence the search. Moribe, please head the search of the factory."]
139: 2616| [47] [Jun]
140: 2619| [45] ["Roger."]
141: 2624| [45] [And with a bad taste left in their mouths, the group split into their teams at Kazami's order.]
