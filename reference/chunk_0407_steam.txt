  1:   55| [45] [--]
  2:   60| [45] [----]
  3:   65| [45] [------His consciousness was in an endless darkness.]
  4:   76| [47] [???]
  5:   77| [45] [(Where am I...?)]
  6:   82| [45] [He didn't know.]
  7:   87| [45] [His head was a total blank.]
  8:   92| [47] [???]
  9:   93| [45] [(What is this...?)]
 10:   98| [45] [He couldn't remember a thing.]
 11:  103| [47] [???]
 12:  104| [45] [(How did this happen?)]
 13:  109| [45] [He desperately tried to figure out why.]
 14:  114| [45] [Soon enough, a mysterious voice whispered in the corners of his mind.]
 15:  119| [45] [It whispered but one word: "awaken"--]
 16:  127| [47] [Me]
 17:  130| [45] ["..."]
 18:  138| [47] [Me]
 19:  141| [45] ["... Mmm..."]
 20:  204| [45] [--I wake up in some place I've never seen before.]
 21:  209| [47] [Me]
 22:  210| [45] [(...?)]
 23:  215| [47] [Me]
 24:  216| [45] [(Where am I...?)]
 25:  227| [45] [With that thought in mind, I look around. I find myself lying in some sort of bed.]
 26:  232| [45] [Immaculate white sheets and the wafting scent of antiseptics... Looks like I'm in a hospital room of some sort.]
 27:  237| [45] [Just then, two women look down on my face.]
 28:  298| [47] [Woman 1]
 29:  301| [45] ["Ah...! You've finally come to, haven't you!?"]
 30:  310| [47] [Woman 2]
 31:  313| [45] ["Th-thank God! Captain, do you know who I am?"]
 32:  318| [45] [Looks like those two know me.]
 33:  323| [45] [But I don't remember them at all. Not in the slightest.]
 34:  334| [47] [Me]
 35:  337| [45] ["Who are...?"]
 36:  345| [47] [Me]
 37:  348| [45] ["No, more importantly, where am I...?"]
 38:  359| [45] [Their expressions freeze upon hearing my question.]
 39:  368| [47] [Woman 1]
 40:  371| [45] ["C-Captain...!"]
 41:  380| [47] [Woman 2]
 42:  383| [45] ["S... so he's really got amnesia again...!?"]
 43:  388| [47] [Me]
 44:  389| [45] [(Amnesia...?)]
 45:  438| [45] [Once I hear that, I try to think about myself.]
 46:  443| [45] [But-- my brain's a complete blank slate.]
 47:  448| [45] [Stunned, I frantically launch a barrage of questions at the women.]
 48:  484| [47] [Me]
 49:  487| [45] ["What the hell is this!? What's going on!? I can't remember anything!"]
 50:  495| [47] [Woman 1]
 51:  498| [45] ["..."]
 52:  506| [47] [Me]
 53:  509| [45] ["Y-you guys know, right!? Who in the world am I!?"]
 54:  554| [45] [After a brief period of silence, they answer my question.]
 55:  595| [47] [Woman 1]
 56:  598| [45] ["You're... a rescue squad captain."]
 57:  606| [47] [Me]
 58:  609| [45] ["A rescue squad...?"]
 59:  617| [47] [Woman 1]
 60:  620| [45] ["Yes... you were brought to this hospital after getting injured during a mission."]
 61:  628| [47] [Woman 1]
 62:  631| [45] ["It's likely you lost your memories due to that injury..."]
 63:  657| [47] [Woman 2]
 64:  660| [45] ["You see, you risked your life to save everyone."]
 65:  668| [47] [Woman 2]
 66:  671| [45] ["You ran all the way through poisonous gas... and used your own body as a shield to protect a girl from falling debris."]
 67:  679| [47] [Me]
 68:  682| [45] ["I did all that...?"]
 69:  708| [47] [Woman 1]
 70:  711| [45] ["Yes... because you were like a model rescue worker."]
 71:  719| [47] [Me]
 72:  722| [45] ["...!?"]
 73:  727| [45] [Something about what they're saying just feels off for some reason.]
 74:  732| [45] [It just didn't sound accurate.]
 75:  737| [47] [Me]
 76:  738| [45] [(I'm... a rescue squad captain...?)]
 77:  743| [47] [Me]
 78:  744| [45] [(--No! That's not true! I can tell!)]
 79:  749| [45] [I'm bursting with the overwhelming sense that I've failed to accomplish something.]
 80:  757| [47] [Me]
 81:  760| [45] ["... Hey guys, can you be honest with me?"]
 82:  801| [47] [Woman 2]
 83:  804| [45] ["Huh?"]
 84:  812| [47] [Me]
 85:  815| [45] ["I'm not that admirable of a person, am I?"]
 86:  823| [47] [Me]
 87:  826| [45] ["It's like I'm more... no, I can't put it into words, but...!"]
 88:  852| [47] [Woman 2]
 89:  855| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about!?"]
 90:  881| [47] [Woman 1]
 91:  884| [45] ["She's right! You are a genuine rescue squad captain, through and through!"]
 92:  889| [45] [--Their attempts to gloss things over is all the proof I need to come to a conclusion:]
 93:  894| [45] ["These women are lying."]
 94:  952| [45] [Just then--]
 95: 1023| [47] [Me]
 96: 1026| [45] ["--!?"]
 97: 1031| [45] [A scene from what I believe to be my past flashes through my head for a second.]
 98: 1038| [47] [Me]
 99: 1039| [45] [(That's right! There's something-- something I had to do for her sake!)]
100: 1096| [45] [Urged on by that impulse, I leap out of bed.]
101: 1129| [47] [Woman 2]
102: 1132| [45] ["Wait, where are you going!?"]
103: 1147| [45] [I ignore her question and run barefoot.]
104: 1152| [45] [But then I see a black suited man blocking the door out of the room.]
105: 1157| [47] [Black Suited Man 1]
106: 1160| [45] ["Hey! Stop it, you bastard!"]
107: 1165| [45] [The man reaches into his pocket,]
108: 1173| [47] [Me]
109: 1176| [45] ["Outta my way!"]
110: 1202| [45] [but I immediately knock him off his feet.]
111: 1207| [47] [Black Suited Man 1]
112: 1210| [45] ["Gwagh!"]
113: 1215| [45] [I keep up that momentum and open the door.]
114: 1254| [47] [Woman 2]
115: 1257| [45] ["Don't do it, Captain!"]
116: 1283| [47] [Woman 1]
117: 1286| [45] ["Wait! Don't go, Watase!"]
118: 1292| [45] [I shake off their warnings and rush out of the room.]
119: 1346| [47] [Black Suited Man 1]
120: 1349| [45] ["Wait!"]
121: 1354| [47] [Black Suited Man 2]
122: 1357| [45] ["Don't let him get away!"]
123: 1362| [47] [Black Suited Man 3]
124: 1365| [45] ["What the hell are you doing!? Catch him!"]
125: 1370| [45] [I see two more black suited men out in the hallway. I manage to shove them away too.]
126: 1375| [45] [I don't really get what's going on. Why are those men chasing me?]
127: 1380| [45] [But at any rate, my goal is to run outside.]
128: 1430| [45] [I finally locate the exit. And just as I'm about to leave the hospital--]
129: 1441| [47] [???]
130: 1444| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi! Stop right there!"]
131: 1449| [45] [A sharp, sudden shout brings me to a halt.]
132: 1610| [45] [I turn around to see a woman standing there,]
133: 1615| [45] [accompanied by men in imposing suits.]
134: 1623| [47] [Me]
135: 1626| [45] ["What...? Don't tell me those guys chasing me are your doing?"]
136: 1634| [47] [???]
137: 1637| [45] ["Quit joking. I'd appreciate it if you don't group me in with those guys."]
138: 1645| [47] [Me]
139: 1648| [45] ["Hmph, well, whatever. Either way, you've come to capture me too, right?"]
140: 1656| [47] [???]
141: 1659| [45] ["No. I'm here to protect you."]
142: 1667| [47] [Me]
143: 1670| [45] ["What...?"]
144: 1675| [45] [As I reel in confusion, the woman orders the men to step back.]
145: 1734| [47] [???]
146: 1737| [45] ["Well? Now you can let your guard down a little, right?"]
147: 1745| [47] [Me]
148: 1748| [45] ["A little, yes... Then can I ask you a question?"]
149: 1756| [47] [???]
150: 1759| [45] ["What?"]
151: 1767| [47] [Me]
152: 1770| [45] ["You called me 'Captain Kasasagi' just now, didn't you?"]
153: 1778| [47] [Me]
154: 1781| [45] ["That means you know who I am too, don't you?"]
155: 1789| [47] [???]
156: 1792| [45] ["Yes, I know you quite well. Both before your amnesia and after."]
157: 1800| [47] [???]
158: 1803| [45] ["What's more, I've looked into your life."]
159: 1811| [47] [Me]
160: 1814| [45] ["Then tell me. Who am I?"]
161: 1822| [47] [Me]
162: 1825| [45] ["I feel like I had to fulfill some sort of duty... but it looks like I've even forgotten what that was."]
163: 1833| [47] [Me]
164: 1836| [45] ["I can only vaguely remember it... What is it that I have to do...?"]
165: 1841| [45] [The woman smiles faintly at my question.]
166: 1849| [47] [???]
167: 1852| [45] ["--It might be better for you not to know."]
168: 1860| [47] [Me]
169: 1863| [45] ["... Huh?"]
170: 1871| [47] [???]
171: 1874| [45] ["The person you are now may vanish completely if you get your memories back."]
172: 1882| [47] [???]
173: 1885| [45] ["What's more, you and I could become enemies in that case."]
174: 1893| [47] [???]
175: 1896| [45] ["There's no turning back once you learn the truth. Are you still sure you won't regret it?"]
176: 1904| [47] [Me]
177: 1907| [45] ["..."]
178: 1912| [45] [Her solemn question leaves me speechless.]
179: 1917| [45] [I get the distinct feeling something like this has happened before.]
180: 1922| [45] [But even so--]
181: 1930| [47] [Me]
182: 1933| [45] ["... I don't care. I'm sure it must be better than living completely in the dark."]
183: 1982| [47] [???]
184: 1985| [45] ["I see... I figured you'd say something like that, given your circumstances."]
185: 1993| [47] [???]
186: 1996| [45] ["Then let's talk. I'll tell you all about what kind of person you are and how you lived..."]
187: 2004| [47] [???]
188: 2007| [45] ["What I am about to tell you is your 'truth'."]
189: 2059| [85] [　%N　%N]
190: 2064| [45] [--The woman then begins to talk.]
191: 2068| [85] [　]
192: 2073| [45] [She tells me the details of my 32 years of life and the story of the nine hours I spent with her and those other women.]
193: 2077| [85] [　]
194: 2082| [45] [It then hits me when she finishes talking--%NNone of this is over yet!]
195: 2086| [85] [　]
196: 2091| [45] [I feel a blazing fire in my heart silently stir to life.]
