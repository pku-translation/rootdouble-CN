  3:   73| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]

  5:   81| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
  6:  157| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  160| [45] ["*sob* ... *sob* ..."]
  8:  168| [47] [Yuuri]
  9:  171| [45] ["Wh-what do we do, Hikorin... I'm scared...!"]
 10:  204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  207| [45] ["Don't cry, Yuuri! I'll do something!"]
 12:  212| [45] [--That day, Yuuri and Natsuhiko came to LABO.]
 13:  217| [45] [And they were caught in the ensuing fire...]
 14:  311| [45] [--They fled into a nearby room as the fires drew close.]
 15:  316| [45] [But the smoke and the heat had sapped Yuuri's body of its energy.]
 16:  335| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at her with tears welling in his eyes.]
 17:  361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  364| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri... it's all because I took you with me..."]
 19:  372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  375| [45] ["I tried to act cool and say I'd save Mom..."]
 21:  383| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  386| [45] ["But I couldn't, and now I got you trapped in this mess..."]
 23:  412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  415| [45] ["I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...!"]
 25:  420| [45] [It wrenched Yuuri's heart to hear those words.]
 26:  425| [45] [So she gently wiped away his tears.]
 27:  433| [47] [Yuuri]
 28:  436| [45] ["... It's okay, Hikorin..."]
 29:  444| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  447| [45] ["It's because you're always trying your hardest, for everyone else..."]
 31:  455| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  458| [45] ["I loved that about you..."]
 33:  466| [47] [Yuuri]
 34:  469| [45] ["So I'm glad... that you stayed with me... until the end."]
 35:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  524| [45] ["Yuuri...!"]
 37:  529| [45] [Natsuhiko embraced Yuuri.]
 38:  591| [45] [But she could no longer feel his touch, nor the numbness of her own body.]
 39:  596| [45] [As her consciousness faded, only one thing remained in Yuuri's mind.]
 40:  601| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  602| [45] [(... Please, God...)]
 42:  607| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  608| [45] [(I don't care... what happens to me...)]
 44:  613| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  614| [45] [(But if you can save at least one of us...)]
 46:  619| [47] [Yuuri]
 47:  620| [45] [(... please save Hikorin...!)]
 48:  625| [45] [And as if in response to her prayer--]
 49:  630| [45] [Yuuri heard a voice beside her ear.]
 50:  705| [85] [{Someone come save us!}]
 51:  706| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  707| [86] [{Someone come save us!}]
 53:  722| [85] [{We're in Dr. Tenkawa's room!}]
 54:  723| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 55:  724| [86] [{We're in Dr. Tenkawa's room!}]
 56:  752| [45] [--No, it wasn't beside her ear.]
 57:  757| [45] [It sounded like it was echoing directly inside her head--]
 58:  762| [47] [Yuuri]
 59:  763| [45] [(T... telepathy?)]
 60:  768| [47] [Yuuri]
 61:  769| [45] [(Hikorin used telepathy...?)]
 62:  937| [45] [But even that thought of hers began to disappear.]
 63:  942| [45] [As her sight and hearing faded-- Yuuri heard another voice.]
 64:  950| [47] [???]
 65:  953| [45] ["--hiko! Natsuhiko!"]
 66: 1014| [47] [Miyoko]
 67: 1017| [45] ["Ahh, Yuuri too...!"]
 68: 1043| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1046| [45] ["M-Mom...!"]
 70: 1072| [47] [Miyoko]
 71: 1075| [45] ["Thank goodness you're safe!"]
 72: 1101| [47] [Miyoko]
 73: 1104| [45] ["I came here to save you! Let's take Yuuri and get out of here!"]
 74: 1109| [45] [And right after she barely managed to hear the professor yelling--]
 75: 1215| [45] [--Yuuri lost consciousness.]
 76: 1274| [45] [------]
 77: 1279| [45] [----]
 78: 1284| [45] [--And after who knew how long--]
 79: 1292| [47] [Miyoko]
 80: 1295| [45] ["...ri...!"]
 81: 1303| [47] [Miyoko]
 82: 1306| [45] ["Yuuri...!"]
 83: 1311| [45] [Yuuri woke up at the sound of her name.]
 84: 1398| [47] [Yuuri]
 85: 1401| [45] ["Mmm... mmm..."]
 86: 1406| [45] [When she opened her eyes, she saw Dr. Tenkawa.]
 87: 1432| [47] [Miyoko]
 88: 1435| [45] ["Thank goodness. You're awake."]
 89: 1443| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1446| [45] ["Huh... what...?"]
 91: 1454| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1457| [45] ["What happened... to me...?"]
 93: 1483| [47] [Miyoko]
 94: 1486| [45] ["You don't remember?"]
 95: 1494| [47] [Miyoko]
 96: 1497| [45] ["After you got caught in a fire in LABO, you were asleep for an entire day."]
 97: 1502| [45] [Yuuri looked around.]
 98: 1507| [45] [She appeared to be in a hospital room, but Natsuhiko was nowhere to be seen.]
 99: 1515| [47] [Yuuri]
100: 1518| [45] ["Umm... where's Hikorin?"]
101: 1541| [45] [But without answering Yuuri's question, the professor asked her a question of her own.]
102: 1549| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1552| [45] ["By the way, Yuuri."]
104: 1560| [47] [Miyoko]
105: 1563| [45] ["I'm sorry for asking this right after you woke up, but... can I get you to take a little test with me?"]
106: 1571| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1574| [45] ["A test?"]
108: 1600| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1603| [45] ["We need to make sure your body hasn't developed any problems."]
110: 1629| [47] [Miyoko]
111: 1632| [45] ["You two were bombarded with hazardous particles, you see."]
112: 1637| [45] [Yuuri didn't know what "hazardous particles" were and her head felt a little groggy--%Nbut she answered obediently nonetheless.]
113: 1645| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1648| [45] ["Okay."]
115: 1710| [45] [--Afterwards, Yuuri underwent various tests.]
116: 1715| [45] [They took blood and urine samples and put her inside a giant machine to take pictures of what was inside her head.]
117: 1720| [45] [At first, Dr. Tenkawa seemed the same as usual-- but as the tests progressed, the look on her face froze over.]
118: 1790| [47] [Miyoko]
119: 1793| [45] ["--Yuuri's 'IGF2R gene' is Type S...!?"]
120: 1798| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa perused the test results on a PDA as she spoke with someone who appeared to be an assistant.]
121: 1806| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 1809| [45] ["That's impossible. Are you sure there's no mistake?"]
123: 1824| [47] [Assistant]
124: 1827| [45] ["W-we've redone the test several times... and it's turned out Type S each time."]
125: 1835| [47] [Miyoko]
126: 1838| [45] ["No, it couldn't be...!"]
127: 1882| [45] [The professor turned to Yuuri with a serious look on her face and asked her a question.]
128: 1890| [47] [Miyoko]
129: 1893| [45] ["Yuuri, what was your BC aptitude? They've measured you in school, right?"]
130: 1901| [47] [Yuuri]
131: 1904| [45] ["Umm... it's 'C'."]
132: 1912| [47] [Miyoko]
133: 1915| [45] ["..."]
134: 1920| [45] [As the professor sunk into silence, her assistant whispered into her ear.]
135: 1964| [47] [Assistant]
136: 1967| [45] ["It's exactly as she says..."]
137: 1972| [47] [Assistant]
138: 1975| [45] ["All of her past examination results have recorded her IGF2R gene as Type C."]
139: 2022| [47] [Miyoko]
140: 2025| [45] ["H-hold it right there. You mean to say--"]
141: 2033| [47] [Miyoko]
142: 2036| [45] ["Her gene mutated!?"]
143: 2041| [45] [Even the look on the assistant's face changed when she said that last word.]
144: 2088| [47] [Miyoko]
145: 2091| [45] ["Y-Yuuri! Can you try using telepathy for me!?"]
146: 2099| [47] [Yuuri]
147: 2102| [45] ["Huh? But I haven't been able to use telepathy yet--"]
148: 2110| [47] [Miyoko]
149: 2113| [45] ["That's what I thought, but please, try!"]
150: 2121| [47] [Miyoko]
151: 2124| [45] ["Focus on something you want to tell me. Anything!"]
152: 2129| [45] [It was hard to think of something on the spot like that-- but Yuuri did as she was told.]
153: 2134| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2135| [45] [(I've never used telepathy before, but...)]
155: 2140| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 2141| [45] [(Um... Let's see...)]
157: 2213| [47] [Yuuri]
158: 2216| [45] [{Does it look like Hikorin will be okay?}]
159: 2295| [47] [Miyoko]
160: 2298| [45] ["!!"]
161: 2303| [45] [The professor audibly gasped.]
162: 2308| [45] [And at the same time, Yuuri felt something strange as well.]
163: 2313| [45] [It felt completely different from all the times she had tried and failed to use telepathy before.]
164: 2318| [45] [--It was almost like the thought she had weaved inside her head had spewed out--]
165: 2367| [47] [Miyoko]
166: 2370| [45] ["... Yuuri, you're worried about Natsuhiko, aren't you..."]
167: 2378| [47] [Yuuri]
168: 2381| [45] ["Ah... y-yeah."]
169: 2386| [45] [The professor responded to Yuuri's question.]
170: 2391| [45] [The question she only thought of inside her head.]
171: 2399| [47] [Miyoko]
172: 2402| [45] ["... Okay, then. Now I'll think of the answer to your question inside my head."]
173: 2410| [47] [Miyoko]
174: 2413| [45] ["Use BC to try and read that answer."]
175: 2421| [47] [Yuuri]
176: 2424| [45] ["Huh? But isn't that empathy...?"]
177: 2432| [47] [Miyoko]
178: 2435| [45] ["Please, just try it."]
179: 2440| [47] [Yuuri]
180: 2441| [45] [(B-but why? I can't pull that off...)]
181: 2446| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 2447| [45] [(Mashiron said hardly any kids out there can use empathy...)]
183: 2505| [45] [But even so, Yuuri focused hard to try and read the professor's mind.]
184: 2510| [45] [And soon enough-- Yuuri heard a voice echoing inside her head.]
185: 2799| [85] [{Natsuhiko's sleeping in another hospital room. There's no need to worry.}]
186: 2800| [86] [Miyoko]
187: 2801| [86] [{Natsuhiko's sleeping in another hospital room. There's no need to worry.}]
188: 2951| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2954| [45] ["!!"]
190: 2959| [45] [This time Yuuri was surprised for sure.]
191: 2964| [45] [The professor hadn't moved her mouth at all. And yet Yuuri heard her voice--!!]
192: 2969| [47] [Yuuri]
193: 2970| [45] [(Her mental voice...!)]
194: 2975| [45] [Yuuri relayed what she heard from that voice back to the professor.]
195: 2983| [47] [Yuuri]
196: 2986| [45] ["H... Hikorin's... sleeping?"]
197: 3034| [47] [Miyoko]
198: 3037| [45] ["...!!"]
199: 3045| [47] [Miyoko]
200: 3048| [45] ["... That's right. That's exactly right."]
201: 3053| [45] [The assistant spoke up mere moments after the professor had just barely managed to wring those words out.]
202: 3097| [47] [Assistant]
203: 3100| [45] ["P-professor, could this be...?"]
204: 3108| [47] [Miyoko]
205: 3111| [45] ["It's hard to believe... but it appears she's rapidly begun to demonstrate use of both telepathy and empathy."]
206: 3119| [47] [Miyoko]
207: 3122| [45] ["There's no room for doubt here... She's an Acquired Rank S Aptitude Communicator."]
208: 3127| [47] [Assistant]
209: 3130| [45] ["B-but how did this happen!?"]
210: 3177| [47] [Miyoko]
211: 3180| [45] ["During the accident, the WX particle energy in Area 5 reached a maximum of 9500 mSv--"]
212: 3188| [47] [Miyoko]
213: 3191| [45] ["--which damaged her gene and caused it to reconstruct itself to best suit its environment."]
214: 3199| [47] [Miyoko]
215: 3202| [45] ["But I never expected a theoretical phenomenon like that to be realized in such a fashion."]
216: 3207| [47] [Assistant]
217: 3210| [45] ["Then do you mean-- the same happened to the boy that was with her!?"]
218: 3218| [47] [Miyoko]
219: 3221| [45] ["I cannot rule out that possibility...!"]
220: 3226| [45] [The professor looked at Yuuri and spoke in a low voice.]
221: 3273| [47] [Miyoko]
222: 3276| [45] ["I'm sorry, Yuuri, but please wait in this room for a little while."]
223: 3284| [47] [Miyoko]
224: 3287| [45] ["I need to go do some tests with Natsuhiko too."]
225: 3295| [47] [Yuuri]
226: 3298| [45] ["Um... was something wrong?"]
227: 3306| [47] [Miyoko]
228: 3309| [45] ["... Normally, I'd say these were good results, but..."]
229: 3317| [47] [Miyoko]
230: 3320| [45] ["Anyway, I'll be back soon."]
231: 3325| [45] [And with that, Dr. Tenkawa and her assistant left the room.]
232: 3397| [47] [Yuuri]
233: 3398| [45] [(...)]
234: 3403| [45] [Left all alone, Yuuri suddenly felt scared.]
235: 3408| [45] [Even an easygoing person like her could tell...]
236: 3413| [45] [that things were about to get out of hand somehow...]
