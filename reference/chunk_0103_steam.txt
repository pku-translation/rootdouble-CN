  1:    5| [45] [But Watase didn't feel the need to be intimidated by every little thing they said.]
  2:   13| [47] [Watase]
  3:   16| [45] ["Anyway, let's hurry up with the search. We have a lot of rooms to check."]
  4:   60| [45] [--And with that, the group began searching each and every room.]
  5:  106| [45] [They stood in front of a room on the edge of the outer ring--%NKazami headed toward the door, hose at the ready.]
  6:  150| [45] [Watase turned on the PDA's IRT function and checked the door for heat just as he'd been told.]
  7:  158| [47] [Watase]
  8:  161| [45] ["The door's... blue. No heat here."]
  9:  188| [47] [Jun]
 10:  191| [45] ["Roger. I'll open the door, then!"]
 11:  196| [45] [Jun announced that as she opened the door.]
 12:  263| [45] [On the other side of the door lay a disorganized office.]
 13:  271| [47] [Watase]
 14:  274| [45] ["... It doesn't look like there's any signs of a fire here, does it?"]
 15:  336| [47] [Jun]
 16:  339| [45] ["Yeah, but the same goes for any survivors."]
 17:  366| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  369| [45] ["Then search the place for AD. You have 30 seconds."]
 19:  429| [45] [It wasn't long before they found a box.]
 20:  476| [47] [Watase]
 21:  479| [45] ["Huh!? This is a medical box, isn't it!?"]
 22:  488| [45] [But-- it was empty. Somebody must have taken the contents already.]
 23:  496| [47] [Watase]
 24:  499| [45] ["Tch, no luck, huh..."]
 25:  527| [47] [Jun]
 26:  530| [45] ["And no card either."]
 27:  557| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  560| [45] ["Then let's move on to the next room. Be more efficient this time."]
 29:  608| [45] [And so the group searched one room after another.]
 30:  613| [45] [But as the search went on without them finding any AD or survivors, to say nothing of the origin of the smoke--]
 31:  618| [45] [Watase forgot about the threat of fire without even noticing it.]
 32:  667| [47] [Watase]
 33:  670| [45] ["Okay, this is the last room! I'm opening it!"]
 34:  696| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  699| [45] ["No, Captain, stop! You have to check for heat fir--"]
 36:  704| [45] [Watase heard Kazami's warning.]
 37:  738| [45] [But by then, he'd already pressed the open button--]
 38:  812| [45] [And then the door opened with the faint sound of the opening mechanism.]
 39:  817| [45] [--A second later...]
 40:  894| [45] [Watase's ears were filled with a very peculiar sound.]
 41:  899| [45] [He also felt something like the air getting sucked up at the same time.]
 42:  904| [47] [Watase]
 43:  905| [45] [(What's that!?)]
 44:  910| [45] [Watase's gaze turned to what lay in the room.]
 45:  915| [45] [And what he saw--]
 46: 1058| [45] [--was a fiery maelstrom shooting out at him.]
 47: 1066| [47] [Watase]
 48: 1069| [45] ["!?"]
 49: 1074| [45] [At that moment, a memory flashed back in his mind.]
 50: 1171| [47] [Kazami]
 51: 1174| [45] ["If a door ever shows up on the scanner as red or yellow, then make sure you do -not- open it for any reason."]
 52: 1200| [47] [Jun]
 53: 1203| [45] ["So when the door to the place is opened, fresh air rapidly pours into the room and then--"]
 54: 1243| [47] [Jun]
 55: 1246| [45] ["Kaboom!!"]
 56: 1272| [47] [Jun]
 57: 1275| [45] ["... it starts burning again like an explosion."]
 58: 1344| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1345| [45] [(Oh cra-)]
 60: 1350| [45] [By the time he completed that thought, Watase had been engulfed by red hot flames.]
 61: 1501| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
 62: 1504| [45] [√A Bad Ending #2 [The Careless]]
 63: 1507| [85] [　]
 64: 1510| [45] [The result of Watase not taking Kazami and Jun's explanation seriously.]
 65: 1513| [85] [　]
 66: 1516| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Kazami, Jun, and Watase's Senses to very high levels at the SSS input just before this ending.]
