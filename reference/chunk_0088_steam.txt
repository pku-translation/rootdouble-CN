  1:   94| [47] [Watase]
  2:   97| [45] ["Wh-what the hell...!?"]
  3:  123| [47] [Ukita]
  4:  126| [45] ["So not only did you not find a body, but you didn't even stop like you said you did.%NWhy did you lie, hmm?"]
  5:  134| [47] [Watase]
  6:  137| [45] ["...!"]
  7:  142| [45] [Watase couldn't answer that question.]
  8:  168| [47] [Ukita]
  9:  171| [45] ["That's not all that's strange either. There's also the video's timestamp."]
 10:  180| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  183| [45] ["'1:49 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 12:  191| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  194| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '1:55 PM'."]
 14:  203| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  206| [45] ["'1:52 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 16:  214| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  217| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '1:58 PM'."]
 18:  226| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  229| [45] ["'1:55 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 20:  237| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  240| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '2:01 PM'."]
 22:  249| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  252| [45] ["'1:58 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 24:  260| [47] [Ukita]
 25:  263| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '2:04 PM'."]
 26:  272| [47] [Watase]
 27:  275| [45] ["What!?"]
 28:  301| [47] [Jun]
 29:  304| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, is that true!?"]
 30:  330| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  333| [45] ["Yes, I checked my watch when he came back, so I'm sure of it."]
 32:  338| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Ukita did say,]
 33:  343| [45] ["You sure took quite some time. Did something happen?" when they regrouped in the factory.]
 34:  348| [45] [Watase had thought the time lag had been because he'd been shocked and out of it from finding a body, but--]
 35:  420| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  423| [45] ["There is no way that it takes six minutes to get from the inner ring to the factory."]
 37:  431| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  434| [45] ["Where were you and what were you doing in that six minute blank?"]
 39:  442| [47] [Watase]
 40:  445| [45] ["W-well... I was really out of it after seeing that body..."]
 41:  453| [47] [Watase]
 42:  456| [45] ["When I came to my senses, I was walking down the inner ring's hallway... but as for where and what I was doing..."]
 43:  482| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  485| [45] ["But that's not true. The archive footage even shows that there was no body in the first place!"]
 45:  500| [47] [Watase]
 46:  503| [45] ["No, I know what I saw...!"]
 47:  508| [45] [His memory of finding Yuuri's body was still crystal clear in Watase's mind.]
 48:  513| [45] [But his "subjective" memory had been smashed into pieces by Ukita's rebuttal-- and the "objective" video footage.]
 49:  539| [47] [Jun]
 50:  542| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this, Captain...?"]
 51:  568| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  571| [45] ["Do you even need to ask? I believe it is quite obvious: he was lying."]
 53:  597| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  600| [45] ["Ly...ing...?"]
 55:  608| [47] [Ukita]
 56:  611| [45] ["Right. He came back to the factory late on the excuse that he 'saw' a body that was never actually there."]
 57:  637| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  640| [45] ["He probably took that opportunity to steal the AD under our noses."]
 59:  654| [47] [Watase]
 60:  657| [45] ["...!"]
 61:  662| [45] [Watase instinctively fell quiet.]
 62:  667| [45] [His memory of finding the body was crystal clear-- but his "subjective" memory had been smashed into pieces by the "objective" video footage.]
 63:  693| [47] [Jun]
 64:  696| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this, Captain... why would you ever lie like that?"]
 65:  722| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  725| [45] ["Why, you ask? I believe it is quite obvious."]
 67:  733| [47] [Ukita]
 68:  736| [45] ["He used that as an excuse to show up late to the factory..."]
 69:  762| [47] [Ukita]
 70:  765| [45] ["Then probably took that opportunity to steal the AD under our noses."]
 71:  857| [47] [All]
 72:  860| [45] ["!!"]
 73:  865| [45] [Everyone gasped at Ukita's accusation.]
 74:  873| [47] [Watase]
 75:  876| [45] ["N-no! I never did anything like that!"]
 76:  980| [47] [Ukita]
 77:  983| [45] ["Then what were you doing for six minutes? You knew we were in a race against time, yes?"]
 78:  991| [47] [Watase]
 79:  994| [45] ["..."]
 80:  999| [45] [Watase instinctively fell quiet, overwhelmed by confusion.]
 81: 1026| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1029| [45] ["What's wrong, Captain...? Say something..."]
 83: 1055| [47] [Jun]
 84: 1058| [45] ["Were you... were you lying to us...?"]
 85: 1066| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1069| [45] ["N-no..."]
 87: 1077| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1080| [45] ["I swear that I don't know what happened..."]
 89: 1106| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1109| [45] ["I see now, so you can't even trust yourself? So you're chalking all this up to your memory impairment. Very well, so be it."]
 91: 1135| [47] [Ukita]
 92: 1138| [45] ["But you know... that is also an admission that nothing you have said up until this point can be trusted."]
 93: 1146| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1149| [45] ["What...?"]
 95: 1157| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1160| [45] ["When we were arguing over the disappearance of the AD earlier, you were the one who scolded us. You looked confident that you weren't the culprit."]
 97: 1186| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1189| [45] ["But how are we supposed to trust the words of a man who hallucinated seeing a body?"]
 99: 1197| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1200| [45] ["Isn't it possible that you hid the AD somewhere and simply forgot about it?"]
101: 1208| [47] [Watase]
102: 1211| [45] ["Th-that's impossible! No chance in hell! I'm sane!"]
103: 1237| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1240| [45] ["Sane? Then that must mean you're a liar instead."]
105: 1248| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1251| [45] ["You lied about finding a body, and you're probably lying about not stealing the AD too."]
107: 1259| [47] [Watase]
108: 1262| [45] ["Ugh..."]
109: 1267| [45] [It was then that Watase realized it.]
110: 1272| [45] [Whether he was sane or not, it didn't change the fact that either way, his words were no longer trustworthy.]
111: 1298| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1301| [45] ["P-please wait... the question here is why he would ever tell such a bizarre lie like that..."]
113: 1327| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1330| [45] ["Who knows? But if you think of it that way, then that makes everything about him suspicious."]
115: 1356| [47] [Ukita]
116: 1359| [45] ["Like, for example-- were the memories that he claimed he 'got back' really true to begin with?"]
117: 1367| [47] [Watase]
118: 1370| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
119: 1378| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1381| [45] ["You claimed you went down to the basement to rescue survivors. But perhaps that's yet another lie--"]
121: 1389| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1392| [45] ["And in reality, you came down for a completely different purpose."]
123: 1400| [47] [Watase]
124: 1403| [45] ["Wh-what different purpose...?"]
125: 1429| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1432| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? To kill."]
127: 1440| [47] [Watase]
128: 1443| [45] ["!!"]
129: 1448| [45] [Watase gasped with shock. Ukita continued.]
130: 1456| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1459| [45] ["Yes, this was not an act of terrorism, but rather a systematic murder."]
132: 1485| [47] [Ukita]
133: 1488| [45] ["Take this theory for example: you wanted to kill your coworker 'Dojima' for some reason..."]
134: 1496| [47] [Ukita]
135: 1499| [45] ["So you decided to murder him during a dispatch to a disaster site."]
136: 1525| [47] [Ukita]
137: 1528| [45] ["If he died at a site with a particularly nasty fire, his corpse would have been burned up. Then his death would have been dismissed as an accident."]
138: 1536| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1539| [45] ["Once you came up with this scheme, you took this incident as the perfect opportunity to put your plan into motion."]
140: 1611| [47] [Ukita]
141: 1614| [45] ["But those two researchers witnessed what you'd done. So you killed them to silence them."]
142: 1622| [47] [Watase]
143: 1625| [45] ["...!"]
144: 1651| [47] [Ukita]
145: 1654| [45] ["Hiyama barely managed to escape, but in the end he got burned to death."]
146: 1680| [47] [Ukita]
147: 1683| [45] ["And if we think of it that way, then perhaps Yuuri and that girl who died by the lift... were also witnesses."]
148: 1709| [47] [Ukita]
149: 1712| [45] ["Oh, and that's right, Louise-- you know, the one who runs away from you every time she sees you-- may also be a witness."]
150: 1727| [47] [Watase]
151: 1730| [45] ["Stop already! That's all bullshit! Why the hell would I ever do any of that!?"]
152: 1756| [47] [Ukita]
153: 1759| [45] ["I don't have proof that you did it. But there's also no proof that you -didn't- do it."]
154: 1785| [47] [Ukita]
155: 1788| [45] ["That is something that you yourself have acknowledged repeatedly, yes?"]
156: 1796| [47] [Watase]
157: 1799| [45] ["Khh..."]
158: 1813| [47] [Watase]
159: 1816| [45] ["A-are you serious...? No way, that can't be true, can it...?!"]
160: 1842| [47] [Ukita]
161: 1845| [45] ["Oh? Does this mean that even you suspect that it's the truth?"]
162: 1853| [47] [Watase]
163: 1856| [45] ["...!"]
164: 1861| [45] [It had been for a second-- only a mere second-- but he had indeed suspected that.]
165: 1866| [47] [Watase]
166: 1867| [45] [(Th-that's right... now that I think about it, a lot of things were strange from the beginning.)]
167: 1872| [47] [Watase]
168: 1873| [45] [(The reason Salyu kept running away was because... she was running from -me-?)]
169: 1878| [47] [Watase]
170: 1879| [45] [(... No way... Is that true...?)]
171: 1923| [45] [Watase looked around, seeking help.]
172: 1928| [45] [He locked eyes with Kazami. A troubled look rose to her face.]
173: 1982| [47] [Watase]
174: 1985| [45] ["T-Tachibana... did I hate that Dojima guy... enough to kill him...?"]
175: 2011| [47] [Kazami]
176: 2014| [45] ["I-I don't know..."]
177: 2022| [47] [Watase]
178: 2025| [45] ["Then... do you at least know if I ever acted like I might...?"]
179: 2033| [47] [Kazami]
180: 2036| [45] ["I really don't know."]
181: 2071| [47] [Kazami]
182: 2074| [45] ["I don't know because you never once talked about yourself...!"]
183: 2079| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase with sad eyes.]
184: 2087| [47] [Watase]
185: 2090| [45] ["I never talked about myself...?"]
186: 2098| [47] [Kazami]
187: 2101| [45] ["No. Before you lost your memories, you were a man who put his distance between others..."]
188: 2109| [47] [Kazami]
189: 2112| [45] ["You never once told anyone what you were thinking, nor did you even attempt to. No one..."]
190: 2138| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2141| [45] ["... Not even me..."]
192: 2146| [45] [Kazami said that in a pained voice. Jun then spoke up.]
193: 2172| [47] [Jun]
194: 2175| [45] ["N-now that you mention it... I don't know anything about the Captain's private life either..."]
195: 2183| [47] [Jun]
196: 2186| [45] ["... I just know him on a work basis..."]
197: 2198| [45] [Those words sent blood rushing to Watase's head.]
198: 2206| [47] [Watase]
199: 2209| [45] ["Th-that can't be!"]
200: 2217| [47] [Watase]
201: 2220| [45] ["Dojima and I were your coworkers, right!? So how could you not know any--"]
202: 2225| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
203: 2251| [47] [Kazami]
204: 2254| [45] ["How could I possibly know when you never once talked about yourself!?"]
205: 2259| [45] [Kazami interjected with a stinging voice.]
206: 2267| [47] [Watase]
207: 2270| [45] ["...!!"]
208: 2275| [45] [Watase gasped. Kazami stared at him with dull eyes.]
209: 2301| [47] [Kazami]
210: 2304| [45] ["No. Before you lost your memories, you were a man who put his distance between others..."]
211: 2312| [47] [Kazami]
212: 2315| [45] ["You never once told anyone what you were thinking, nor did you even attempt to. No one..."]
213: 2323| [47] [Watase]
214: 2326| [45] ["I... I never talked about myself...?"]
215: 2352| [47] [Kazami]
216: 2355| [45] ["Yes... It was like..."]
217: 2381| [47] [Jun]
218: 2384| [45] ["... Like he had something to hide...!?"]
219: 2389| [45] [Jun finished the sentence that Kazami had bitterly begun weaving.]
220: 2397| [47] [Watase]
221: 2400| [45] ["... What would I want to hide?"]
222: 2405| [45] [Jun answered Watase's obvious question in a dry voice.]
223: 2431| [47] [Jun]
224: 2434| [45] ["Who knows...?"]
225: 2442| [47] [Watase]
226: 2445| [45] ["Hey... are you taking this seriously?"]
227: 2471| [47] [Jun]
228: 2474| [45] ["Well, it's just, now that I think about it... I don't know anything about your private life either."]
229: 2482| [47] [Jun]
230: 2485| [45] ["I just know you on a work basis..."]
231: 2532| [47] [Watase]
232: 2535| [45] ["..."]
233: 2540| [45] [Watase was astonished.]
234: 2545| [45] [He'd thought that Kazami and Jun would trust him.]
235: 2550| [45] [Just as he trusted them.]
236: 2555| [45] [Yet they didn't trust not only the Watase without his memories, but even the him from -when- he had his memories.]
237: 2560| [47] [Watase]
238: 2561| [45] [(This isn't happening...!)]
239: 2566| [45] [Watase's feet started shaking.]
240: 2571| [45] [Jun glared at him and spoke.]
241: 2597| [47] [Jun]
242: 2600| [45] ["Captain... tell us the truth..."]
243: 2608| [47] [Jun]
244: 2611| [45] ["Why did you really go down to the basement...?"]
245: 2619| [47] [Jun]
246: 2622| [45] ["You normally would have never left a command post to begin with, so why...?"]
247: 2648| [47] [Jun]
248: 2651| [45] ["Come on, tell me..."]
249: 2659| [47] [Jun]
250: 2662| [45] ["Captain... did you really come here to save lives...?"]
251: 2688| [47] [Jun]
252: 2691| [45] ["If you didn't..."]
253: 2699| [47] [Jun]
254: 2702| [45] ["Then I swear I'll make you pay, you hear...?"]
255: 2707| [45] [Anger was slowly building in Jun's eyes.]
256: 2712| [45] [No, it wasn't as simple as anger.]
257: 2717| [45] [--It was the intent to kill.]
258: 2722| [45] [Jun glared at Watase with bloodthirsty eyes.]
259: 2730| [47] [Watase]
260: 2733| [45] ["No, you're wr..."]
261: 2738| [45] [He wanted to say she was wrong, but he couldn't.]
262: 2743| [45] [He knew anything he said here would sound hollow.]
263: 2802| [45] [Yet he tried to say something-- but just then...]
264: 2889| [47] [Ena]
265: 2892| [45] ["Hold on, you two."]
266: 2897| [45] [Ena spoke up.]
267: 2965| [47] [Jun]
268: 2968| [45] ["... What?"]
269: 2976| [47] [Ena]
270: 2979| [45] ["You guys are acting a little weird."]
271: 3005| [47] [Jun]
272: 3008| [45] ["Huh? How so?"]
273: 3036| [47] [Ukita]
274: 3039| [45] ["Indeed. I believe we have made a truly sound argument."]
275: 3065| [47] [Ena]
276: 3068| [45] ["Nothing about this is 'sound'. Didn't Captain Kasasagi risk his life on multiple occasions to save you guys?"]
277: 3076| [47] [Ena]
278: 3079| [45] ["And yet you turned your backs on him the moment the AD disappeared?%NWhat kind of sane person does that?"]
279: 3105| [47] [Jun]
280: 3108| [45] ["That has nothing to do with this."]
281: 3116| [47] [Jun]
282: 3119| [45] ["Why are -you- on the Captain's side after hearing everything we've just said? I mean, you barely know the guy, right?"]
283: 3145| [47] [Jun]
284: 3148| [45] ["Unless... the two of you are in cahoots or something?"]
285: 3174| [47] [Ena]
286: 3177| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about!?"]
287: 3182| [45] [That sudden accusation left Ena with a confused look on her face.]
288: 3187| [45] [But Ukita kept up the assault before she had time to counter.]
289: 3213| [47] [Ukita]
290: 3216| [45] ["I see, now I get it. I always did think you were acting strange...!"]
291: 3242| [47] [Ukita]
292: 3245| [45] ["Now I finally understand! You two are planning to just save yourselves and leave the rest of us to die!"]
293: 3253| [47] [Ukita]
294: 3256| [45] ["You were the ones who hid the AD, weren't you!? All so you could have it all to yourselves!"]
295: 3323| [45] [Ukita and Jun were glaring at Watase and Ena.]
296: 3328| [45] [It was then that Watase finally realized it:]
297: 3412| [45] [Their eyes were full of madness.]
298: 3476| [47] [Watase]
299: 3477| [45] [(Th-this isn't good... they really are out of their minds...!)]
300: 3482| [45] [Now that he thought about it, there were numerous factors that could be behind it.]
301: 3487| [45] [Their hours of built-up fatigue.]
302: 3492| [45] [The multiple strange happenings in this place.]
303: 3497| [45] [The feeling of entrapment from being stuck down here.]
304: 3502| [45] [The despair at not finding an exit.]
305: 3507| [45] [The fear from finding all those bodies.]
306: 3512| [45] [And then--]
307: 3517| [45] [The loss of the AD had driven the final nail in the coffin.]
308: 3522| [45] [That one act had dramatically shortened the group's lifespan.]
309: 3527| [47] [Watase]
310: 3528| [45] [(It's impossible to expect anyone to remain sane in these circumstances...!)]
311: 3533| [45] [Ukita and Jun prowled towards them.]
312: 3538| [45] [Just then, a voice echoed in Watase's head.]
313: 3596| [85] [{It's too dangerous... take Prof. Tsubakiyama and run!}]
314: 3597| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
315: 3598| [86] [{It's too dangerous... take Prof. Tsubakiyama and run!}]
316: 3701| [47] [Watase]
317: 3704| [45] ["!"]
318: 3709| [45] [Watase came back to his senses and took Ena by the arm.]
319: 3714| [45] [But at that moment--]
320: 3807| [47] [Jun]
321: 3810| [45] ["Trying to run!?"]
322: 3818| [47] [Ukita]
323: 3821| [45] ["Not good! Hold them down!"]
324: 3826| [45] [Jun and Ukita sprung at them.]
325: 3831| [45] [But Watase and Ena barely managed to dodge them in time.]
326: 3888| [47] [Jun]
327: 3891| [45] ["Agh!"]
328: 3899| [47] [Ukita]
329: 3902| [45] ["Ghh!"]
330: 3950| [45] [Jun and Ukita slammed into the monitors.]
331: 4012| [45] [But they quickly turned around and glared at Watase and Ena.]
332: 4092| [47] [Watase]
333: 4095| [45] ["...!"]
334: 4100| [45] [Watase instinctively looked away, only for his eyes to turn to Kazami.]
335: 4123| [47] [Kazami]
336: 4124| [45] ["--"]
337: 4129| [45] [Kazami was looking towards the exit. She then gave Watase a glance as if to say "run".]
338: 4156| [47] [Watase]
339: 4159| [45] ["Teach, let's get out of here!"]
340: 4167| [47] [Ena]
341: 4170| [45] ["R-right!"]
342: 4175| [45] [Watase took Ena's arm and ran out of the room.]
