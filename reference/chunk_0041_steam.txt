  1:   67| [45] [--Watase and Jun let out a deep breath as soon as they made it back to the outer ring.]
  2:   75| [47] [Watase]
  3:   78| [45] ["Haah...!"]
  4:  140| [47] [Jun]
  5:  143| [45] ["Whew, that was nerve-wracking...!"]
  6:  151| [47] [Watase]
  7:  154| [45] ["Still, the danger was well worth it, wouldn't you say?"]
  8:  159| [45] [But Jun's face soon clouded over.]
  9:  185| [47] [Jun]
 10:  188| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 11:  196| [47] [Watase]
 12:  199| [45] ["Huh? Hey, what's wrong?"]
 13:  207| [47] [Jun]
 14:  210| [45] ["Ah, no, sorry... I just feel a little..."]
 15:  245| [47] [Jun]
 16:  248| [45] ["... Ugh!"]
 17:  253| [45] [Jun covered her mouth and bent over.]
 18:  261| [47] [Watase]
 19:  264| [45] ["Moribe!?"]
 20:  272| [47] [Jun]
 21:  275| [45] ["Captain, don't look! I'm gonna hurl!"]
 22:  283| [47] [Watase]
 23:  286| [45] ["Wait, what's that mean agai... ah!"]
 24:  303| [47] [Jun]
 25:  306| [45] ["Urrrrrrgh!"]
 26:  311| [45] [Jun turned her back on Watase and threw up in a corner of the hallway.]
 27:  316| [45] [Watase watched all that in dumbfoundment.]
 28:  321| [45] [Jun soon finished vomiting and managed a smile on her pale face.]
 29:  355| [47] [Jun]
 30:  358| [45] ["... Man, sorry you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed I wanna die."]
 31:  366| [47] [Watase]
 32:  369| [45] ["M-Moribe..."]
 33:  377| [47] [Watase]
 34:  380| [45] ["Hey, don't tell me you got radiation damage...!?"]
 35:  406| [47] [Jun]
 36:  409| [45] ["Huh? N-no, no, that's not it."]
 37:  435| [47] [Jun]
 38:  438| [45] ["I was just so nervous and ran around so much that my fatigue finally caught up with my stomach, that's all."]
 39:  446| [47] [Watase]
 40:  449| [45] ["Seriously!? Hey, let me see your wrist!"]
 41:  476| [45] [Watase grabbed Jun by the wrist.]
 42:  502| [47] [Jun]
 43:  505| [45] ["Hey! 'the hell you doing, you perv!?"]
 44:  513| [47] [Watase]
 45:  516| [45] ["Shut up! Keep it down for a minute!"]
 46:  614| [45] [Jun complied, and Watase examined her Vital Checker.]
 47:  619| [45] [Normally, all five lights would be green, but this time-- one of them was bright red.]
 48:  627| [47] [Watase]
 49:  630| [45] ["It's red! That means there's something wrong with your body, right!?"]
 50:  656| [47] [Jun]
 51:  659| [45] ["Whoa, hold your horses, that's just the 'pulse' indicator, right?"]
 52:  667| [47] [Jun]
 53:  670| [45] ["My heart's just racing a bit 'cause I just got done blowing chunks all over the floor... it'll be green again soon. See?"]
 54:  715| [45] [The light turned green again shortly after Jun said that.]
 55:  743| [47] [Jun]
 56:  746| [45] ["See, I'm all better now. Right as rain."]
 57:  754| [47] [Watase]
 58:  757| [45] ["I see... well, okay then..."]
 59:  783| [47] [Jun]
 60:  786| [45] ["But hey, are -you- okay? You having another headache?"]
 61:  794| [47] [Watase]
 62:  797| [45] ["Huh? Oh... no, I'm all good."]
 63:  802| [45] [He then realized something.]
 64:  807| [45] [The strange feeling he'd felt when he'd entered the contaminated zone had vanished.]
 65:  812| [47] [Watase]
 66:  813| [45] [(So it really was the effects of the radiation...)]
 67:  818| [45] [But that's why Watase was worried.]
 68:  823| [45] [Like him, Jun had also been in a contaminated zone twice.]
 69:  828| [45] [Watase was stronger than her and even he'd fainted. Meaning there was no guarantee someone with such a small body like Jun's would be okay.]
 70:  836| [47] [Watase]
 71:  839| [45] ["... Tell me right away if something comes up."]
 72:  865| [47] [Jun]
 73:  868| [45] ["Thanks for worrying about me. You really are acting so nice today."]
 74:  878| [47] [Watase]
 75:  881| [45] ["What're you talking about? It's only natural to be worried about your partner."]
 76:  890| [47] [Watase]
 77:  893| [45] ["What're you talking about, you idiot? It's only natural for a captain to worry about his subordinate."]
 78:  899| [45] [The two of them smiled at each other. Frail smiles, but smiles nonetheless.]
 79:  925| [47] [Jun]
 80:  928| [45] ["... Anyway, looks like we found quite the treasure back there, huh?"]
 81:  936| [47] [Watase]
 82:  939| [45] ["No kidding. It's too bad that we didn't find any survivors... but it sure is good we found the AD so quickly this time around!"]
 83:  944| [45] [With the five he'd found in the contaminated zone, Watase now had six AD on him.]
 84:  949| [45] [They still had plenty of time left until the next injection, so they could take it easy for a while.]
 85:  975| [47] [Jun]
 86:  978| [45] ["All right! Then let's regroup with the others! I'm sure they'll be as happy as we are!"]
 87:  986| [47] [Watase]
 88:  989| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 89:  994| [45] [Watase and Jun then ran off together.]
 90: 1086| [45] [They headed for a large room in the outer ring-- Kazami and the others were already there to greet them.]
 91: 1163| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1166| [45] ["Oh? That was rather quick."]
 93: 1194| [47] [Ukita]
 94: 1197| [45] ["You're done searching the inner ring?"]
 95: 1205| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1208| [45] ["Yeah. And guess what we found..."]
 97: 1234| [47] [Jun]
 98: 1237| [45] ["More AD!"]
 99: 1242| [45] [Everyone's eyes widened at once.]
100: 1268| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1271| [45] ["How many did you find...?"]
102: 1279| [47] [Watase]
103: 1282| [45] ["Five. Now we have six altogether."]
104: 1308| [47] [Kazami]
105: 1311| [45] ["This is wonderful! It's a good thing you found them quickly this time."]
106: 1430| [47] [Ena]
107: 1433| [45] ["So there -was- a lot of AD stored in Area 5! It's just like the disaster prevention manual said!"]
108: 1441| [47] [Ukita]
109: 1444| [45] ["Indeed. Now we can rest easy."]
110: 1449| [45] [--They chose to keep the fact that the inner ring was contaminated a secret.]
111: 1454| [45] [With their search of it over, they didn't need to give the rest of the group any unnecessary worry.]
112: 1563| [47] [Watase]
113: 1566| [45] ["By the way, how about you guys?"]
114: 1574| [47] [Jun]
115: 1577| [45] ["Find anything?"]
116: 1615| [45] [The rest of the group's faces dimmed slightly.]
117: 1641| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1644| [45] ["No, nothing on our end... no AD and no survivors."]
119: 1670| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1673| [45] ["However, we did come across these..."]
121: 1678| [45] [Ukita held out a bunch of security cards, all labeled "Lv6".]
122: 1686| [47] [Watase]
123: 1689| [45] ["You found that many Level 6 cards?"]
124: 1715| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1718| [45] ["We found those three in the same room. It appears they belong to the person who manages and creates these cards."]
126: 1744| [47] [Ukita]
127: 1747| [45] ["Or perhaps they belong to facility inspectors..."]
128: 1752| [45] [Either way, they now had four Level 6 cards.]
129: 1757| [45] [But there wasn't much use in having so many cards of the same level.]
130: 1783| [47] [Ena]
131: 1786| [45] ["... The cards don't matter. The survivors are much more important."]
132: 1849| [45] [They headed for a large room in the outer ring-- Kazami and the others were already there to greet them.]
133: 1926| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1929| [45] ["Oh? That was rather quick."]
135: 1957| [47] [Ukita]
136: 1960| [45] ["You're done searching the inner ring?"]
137: 1968| [47] [Watase]
138: 1971| [45] ["Yeah... but we didn't really find anything..."]
139: 1997| [47] [Kazami]
140: 2000| [45] ["I see..."]
141: 2026| [47] [Watase]
142: 2029| [45] ["By the way, how about you guys?"]
143: 2037| [47] [Jun]
144: 2040| [45] ["Find anything?"]
145: 2048| [47] [Kazami]
146: 2051| [45] ["No, nothing on our end either... no AD and no survivors."]
147: 2077| [47] [Ukita]
148: 2080| [45] ["However, we did come across these..."]
149: 2085| [45] [Ukita held out a bunch of security cards, all labeled "Lv6".]
150: 2093| [47] [Watase]
151: 2096| [45] ["You found that many Level 6 cards?"]
152: 2122| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2125| [45] ["We found those three in the same room. It appears they belong to the person who manages and creates these cards."]
154: 2151| [47] [Ukita]
155: 2154| [45] ["Or perhaps they belong to facility inspectors..."]
156: 2159| [45] [Either way, they now had four Level 6 cards.]
157: 2164| [45] [But there wasn't much use in having so many cards of the same level.]
158: 2172| [47] [Watase]
159: 2175| [45] ["... Still, I wish we'd found some AD instead..."]
160: 2180| [45] [There were about 30 minutes to go until it was time for their next AD injection--%Nso they had to find more before then.]
161: 2185| [45] [But that wasn't the only problem they had, as Ena's depressed comment reminded them.]
162: 2211| [47] [Ena]
163: 2214| [45] ["And the survivors are important too..."]
164: 2222| [47] [Ena]
165: 2225| [45] ["I wonder why we can't find any of them. Area 6 is the only place we haven't searched yet, right?"]
166: 2233| [47] [Watase]
167: 2236| [45] ["Yeah... It really is... kinda strange that we still haven't found them."]
168: 2391| [45] [They'd already finished searching over 80%% of the facility.]
169: 2396| [45] [Meaning the survivors were either somewhere the group didn't know, or were already dead.]
170: 2401| [47] [Watase]
171: 2402| [45] [(Is there any place we overlooked? Are their bodies there...?)]
172: 2407| [45] [The air grew heavily still as if Watase's sentiments had spread to everyone else.]
173: 2414| [45] [But-- a timid voice rose as if to cut through all that.]
174: 2477| [47] [Yuuri]
175: 2480| [45] ["U-Um... I think it'd be better... if we think positively instead."]
176: 2488| [47] [Watase]
177: 2491| [45] ["Huh?"]
178: 2499| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 2502| [45] ["Wouldn't it be best to believe that the fact we haven't seen them yet... means that everyone's still alive?"]
180: 2510| [47] [Yuuri]
181: 2513| [45] ["... I'm sure they're all in Area 6."]
182: 2518| [45] [Watase was astonished at the longest declaration he'd ever heard Yuuri speak.]
183: 2523| [45] [But something gradually crept out of the depths of his stomach.]
184: 2531| [47] [Watase]
185: 2534| [45] ["... You're right."]
186: 2561| [47] [Kazami]
187: 2564| [45] ["... Indeed."]
188: 2592| [47] [Jun]
189: 2595| [45] ["Yep, Yuuri's absolutely right!"]
190: 2621| [47] [Yuuri]
191: 2624| [45] ["See...?"]
192: 2629| [45] [Yuuri's peaceful smile dispelled the shadows shrouding everyone's faces.]
193: 2655| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2658| [45] ["Indeed... Thinking dark thoughts all the time won't do any good."]
195: 2684| [47] [Ena]
196: 2687| [45] ["That's right. Ms. Sannomiya and all the others are strong kids."]
197: 2695| [47] [Watase]
198: 2698| [45] ["All right...! Then let's continue with the search, people!"]
199: 2724| [47] [Kazami]
200: 2727| [45] ["Yes. Even if they haven't escaped, we should definitely find them in Area 6."]
201: 2732| [45] [The group all nodded at each other and started walking off.]
202: 2737| [45] [Their final destination was "Area 6", where all of their hopes lay--!]
203: 2801| [47] [Kazami]
204: 2804| [45] ["... At any rate, we're done searching Area 5."]
205: 2812| [47] [Kazami]
206: 2815| [45] ["Let's move on to Area 6..."]
207: 2820| [45] [The group nodded gravely at those words.]
