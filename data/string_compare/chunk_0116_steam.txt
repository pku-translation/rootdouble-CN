  2:    6| [45] [(--I can't do it! There's just no way it can be done!)]
  3:   11| [45] [Watase turned his back on the room.]
  4:   63| [45] [But just as he was about to leave--]
  5:  457| [45] [Five faces flashed through his mind.]
  6:  462| [47] [Watase]
  7:  463| [45] [(... Goddammit!)]
  8:  468| [45] [Watase clenched his fists as he stood in that lethal gas.]
  9:  473| [45] [--They needed four more ampules of AD.]
 10:  478| [45] [Four people would be exposed to radiation if he didn't find some quickly.]
 11:  483| [47] [Watase]
 12:  484| [45] [(I don't... I don't want to let anyone die!)]
 13:  489| [45] [He held his ground and turned back.]
 14:  494| [45] [He then ran into the room while cursing himself for his moment of weakness.]
 15:  547| [45] [Watase strained his eyes and looked around as black smoke and raging heat waves assaulted him.]
 16:  645| [45] [Just then, he spotted a medical box in a gap between the flames--!]
 17:  650| [47] [Watase]
 18:  651| [45] [(Is there anything in it!?)]
 19:  656| [45] [Watase ran over to the box and opened it up.]
 20:  665| [45] [Inside were five ampules of AD.]
 21:  670| [47] [Watase]
 22:  671| [45] [(They're here...!)]
 23:  677| [45] [Watase grabbed the box and took it with him.]
 24:  682| [45] [But he then hit his limit.]
 25:  687| [45] [Watase's consciousness started fading from oxygen deprivation.]
 26:  703| [47] [Watase]
 27:  704| [45] [(I... it hurts...!)]
 28:  709| [45] [And then, as his body thirsted for air--]
 29:  714| [45] [The dam within him finally broke down.]
 30:  722| [47] [Watase]
 31:  725| [45] ["--*gasp*"]
 32:  730| [45] [By the time he came to his senses, he was breathing. But a second later--]
 33:  735| [45] [He felt an intense suffocating sensation, like someone had jammed silk floss down his throat.]
 34:  758| [47] [Watase]
 35:  761| [45] ["Gaah... agh... haah...!?"]
 36:  766| [45] [His whole body went rigid in mere moments.]
 37:  771| [45] [His five senses went faint, and his line of sight started blacking out.]
 38:  822| [45] [The words "oxygen-deficient air" crossed his mind.]
 39:  827| [47] [Watase]
 40:  828| [45] [(Let me...)]
 41:  833| [47] [Watase]
 42:  834| [45] [(Let me get this AD to everyone, if nothing else...!)]
 43:  839| [45] [But his body wouldn't move.]
 44:  844| [45] [The flames closed in on him.]
 45:  979| [47] [Watase]
 46:  980| [45] [(It's hot... I'm burning...)]
 47:  985| [47] [Watase]
 48:  986| [45] [(Someone... help... me...)]
 49:  991| [47] [Watase]
 50:  992| [45] [(I... I can't br...--)]
 51:  997| [45] [--Watase's consciousness then shut off, and before long, vanished completely.]
