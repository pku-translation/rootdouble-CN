  1:  140| [47] [Kazami]
  2:  143| [45] ["Ack, aaah..."]
  3:  151| [47] [Salyu]
  4:  154| [45] ["Release Natsuhiko. Or else I'll choke this woman to death."]
  5:  159| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  160| [45] [(S-Salyu!?)]
  7:  168| [47] [Watase]
  8:  171| [45] ["Stop it, Salyu!"]
  9:  179| [47] [Watase]
 10:  182| [45] ["We're just trying to save you guys! Why can't you understand that!?"]
 11:  187| [45] [Watase frantically tried to talk some sense into the bloodthirsty Salyu.]
 12:  192| [45] [But she just gave him a pointed glare--]
 13:  200| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  203| [45] ["I thought I told you to stop telling such transparent lies."]
 15:  211| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  214| [45] ["You think you can trick me after you shot Natsuhiko?"]
 17:  262| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  265| [45] ["Wha... Wait, what did you say...!?"]
 19:  273| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  276| [45] ["You didn't know, woman?"]
 21:  284| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  287| [45] ["You're lying... right...? The Captain would never do anything like that... right...?"]
 23:  295| [47] [Watase]
 24:  298| [45] ["..."]
 25:  303| [45] [Watase gasped at Kazami's words.]
 26:  308| [45] [And at that moment--]
 27:  510| [45] [The memories of back then flickered inside Watase's head once more.]
 28:  515| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  516| [45] [(Crap! At this rate, Watase might regain his memory--!)]
 30:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  522| [45] [(What do I do!? Go back to my body and try to persuade Salyu!?)]
 32:  527| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  528| [45] [(Wait, but...)]
 34:  533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  534| [45] [(Would it be safe to suddenly return to my body when it's barely recovered from the brink of death!?)]
 36:  539| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  540| [45] [(If my body's condition suddenly worsens once it gets out of hibernation--!)]
 38:  545| [45] [As Natsuhiko hesitated, Salyu addressed Kazami.]
 39:  553| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  556| [45] ["Take a close look at what's in that man's pocket."]
 41:  653| [45] [She was of course referring to-- the gun that Watase had picked up in Area N.]
 42:  677| [47] [Salyu]
 43:  680| [45] ["That gun probably belonged to this man to begin with."]
 44:  688| [47] [Salyu]
 45:  691| [45] ["He used it to shoot Natsuh--"]
 46:  696| [45] [Right when Salyu said that, Kazami violently shook her off.]
 47:  755| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  758| [45] ["--I SAID STOP!"]
 49:  836| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  839| [45] ["!"]
 51:  844| [45] [Salyu's body flew through the air.]
 52:  849| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  850| [45] [(!?)]
 54:  855| [45] [All Natsuhiko could do was watch the whole thing from beginning to end.]
 55:  867| [45] [Salyu proceeded to tumble down the staircase.]
 56:  874| [45] [She finally stopped at the landing of the stairs at B1. She wasn't budging an inch.]
 57:  879| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  880| [45] [(--Salyu!)]
 59:  990| [45] [Watase frantically ran over to Salyu and checked her condition.]
 60:  995| [45] [Her life wasn't in danger, but she appeared to be completely knocked out.]
 61: 1000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1001| [45] [(Dammit! If only I hadn't hesitated to go back to my body!)]
 63: 1006| [45] [As Natsuhiko wallowed in regret for not trying to persuade Salyu sooner--]
 64: 1011| [45] [Kazami descended the steps with unsteady feet.]
 65: 1037| [47] [Kazami]
 66: 1040| [45] ["Captain... is she...?"]
 67: 1048| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1051| [45] ["It's okay, she's just passed out."]
 69: 1077| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1080| [45] ["I-I see..."]
 71: 1085| [45] [Kazami's body shook as she spoke. Something was off about her.]
 72: 1090| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase and spoke.]
 73: 1116| [47] [Kazami]
 74: 1119| [45] ["... Captain, may I ask you just one question?"]
 75: 1127| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1130| [45] ["... What is it?"]
 77: 1138| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1141| [45] ["This mystery has been on my mind for a long time..."]
 79: 1167| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1170| [45] ["Captain, why was it that you went down to the basement at 6:42 AM, shortly after this accident occurred?"]
 81: 1178| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1181| [45] ["That's-- I told you guys, that's because Dojima and Hiyama called for me on their radio..."]
 83: 1189| [47] [Kazami]
 84: 1192| [45] ["So what you're saying is that your radio could receive transmissions then, correct?"]
 85: 1218| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1221| [45] ["But... but you know..."]
 87: 1229| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1232| [45] ["I personally tried to reach you on your radio just a few minutes before that...!"]
 89: 1237| [45] ["6:42 AM"--]
 90: 1242| [45] [That was one of the memories Natsuhiko casually bestowed upon Watase when falsifying his memories.]
 91: 1247| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1248| [45] [(Has Ms. Tachibana been doubting Watase this entire time...?)]
 93: 1253| [45] [That doubt wasn't unwarranted.]
 94: 1258| [45] [The loss and imperfect recovery of memory. Hallucinations. Falsehoods. A pistol. Watase could answer none of these lingering questions of hers--]
 95: 1263| [45] [Watase was extremely suspicious. But for Kazami to have followed him this far was probably a testament to just how much she trusted him.]
 96: 1268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1269| [45] [(But that last thing Salyu said must've been...!)]
 98: 1334| [47] [Salyu]
 99: 1337| [45] ["You think you can trick me after you shot Natsuhiko?"]
100: 1362| [45] [That last statement must have been enough to shatter Kazami's trust.]
101: 1388| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1391| [45] ["I... I tried as hard as I could to trust you."]
103: 1399| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1402| [45] ["I've trusted you for as long as I can remember."]
105: 1428| [47] [Kazami]
106: 1431| [45] ["But..."]
107: 1439| [47] [Watase]
108: 1442| [45] ["T-Tachibana...?"]
109: 1468| [47] [Kazami]
110: 1471| [45] ["... I just can't do it, Watase."]
111: 1479| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1482| [45] ["If what Ms. Sannomiya said was true, then everything fits."]
113: 1490| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1493| [45] ["When I think of this facility's true nature and the past you... I realize that there's only one answer."]
115: 1498| [47] [Natsuhiko]
116: 1499| [45] [(Wh-what's going on...?)]
117: 1504| [45] [At that moment, Natsuhiko felt an intense uneasiness.]
118: 1509| [45] [He could understand why Kazami would doubt Watase, but the extent of her doubt was blatantly abnormal.]
119: 1535| [47] [Kazami]
120: 1538| [45] ["... If you are a murderer..."]
121: 1546| [47] [Kazami]
122: 1549| [45] ["Then the least I can do is preserve your good name...!"]
123: 1584| [45] [As Kazami kept muttering incomprehensibly, she reached out for a nearby fire extinguisher.]
124: 1610| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1613| [45] ["You went down the wrong path, Watase..."]
126: 1621| [47] [Kazami]
127: 1624| [45] ["... Now it's time for you to receive your punishment for that choice."]
128: 1630| [45] [--And a second later...]
129: 1767| [47] [Watase]
130: 1770| [45] ["Gwaagh!!"]
131: 1799| [45] [Kazami swung the fire extinguisher horizontally, but Watase quickly blocked it with his arm.]
132: 1877| [47] [Watase]
133: 1880| [45] ["St-stop! Why are you doing this!?"]
134: 1906| [47] [Kazami]
135: 1909| [45] ["Watase... I'm so sorry, Watase..."]
136: 1935| [47] [Kazami]
137: 1938| [45] ["This is the only thing... I can do for you now..."]
138: 2005| [45] [With one look into her eyes, Natsuhiko was convinced.]
139: 2153| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 2154| [45] [(Sh-she's the same! She's the same as Mr. Ukita and Jun!)]
141: 2159| [45] [At that moment, Watase quickly thrust Kazami away.]
142: 2250| [47] [Kazami]
143: 2253| [45] ["Kyah!"]
144: 2258| [45] [She fell on the staircase with the fire extinguisher still in hand.]
145: 2312| [45] [Watase took that opportunity to carry Natsuhiko's body down to the second basement level and rush out of the stairwell.]
146: 2365| [47] [Watase]
147: 2368| [45] ["Dammit! What the hell's going on!?"]
148: 2373| [45] [Thoughts raced through Natsuhiko as Watase shouted that.]
149: 2378| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2379| [45] [(What in the world's going on!?)]
151: 2384| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2385| [45] [(--Why's everyone acting crazy all of a sudden!? Even Ms. Tachibana!?)]
153: 2390| [45] [Something suspicious was happening. But Natsuhiko didn't know what.]
