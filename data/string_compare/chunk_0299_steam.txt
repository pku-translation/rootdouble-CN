  0:   64| [45] [--The year spent preparing for the terrorist plot passed by in the blink of an eye.]
  1:   69| [45] [Watase showed no indications of what he was doing, and continued work as a rescue worker as he had before while secretly getting ready for that day.]
  2:   74| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama were the same. They met with Ukita as little as possible and just waited for September 16.]
  3:   79| [45] [... Then something changed on September 13, three days before D-day.]
  4:   84| [45] [Watase was off-duty that day.]
  5:   89| [45] [It would be his final day off as a rescue worker.]
  6:   94| [45] [So he figured he'd spend the day walking around the city.]
  7:  166| [45] [--He aimlessly strolled through the city where he'd been born and raised.]
  8:  171| [47] [Watase]
  9:  172| [45] [(... I'll probably never be able to come back to this city again once the plan's been executed...)]
 10:  177| [45] [That thought caused him to become sentimental.]
 11:  228| [45] [Various memories passed through his head every time the scenery around him changed.]
 12:  233| [45] [Memories of the restaurant his parents had taken him to.]
 13:  300| [45] [Memories of the clothing store his sister had bought new clothes for him at.]
 14:  305| [47] [Watase]
 15:  306| [45] [(This city's full of places with memories of my family...)]
 16:  311| [45] [He normally wasn't conscious of it, but the city was brimming with nostalgia for him.]
 17:  316| [45] [It wasn't just memories of his family that he recalled.]
 18:  380| [45] [There was one of the bars he'd gone bar-hopping to with Dojima and Hiyama on the night they'd passed the rescue worker exam.]
 19:  385| [45] [There was the cafe where he'd broken up with his first girlfriend.]
 20:  390| [45] [There was the road he'd walked down with his last girlfriend hand in hand as they nestled close to one another.]
 21:  395| [45] [Watase was trying to cast aside all those memories and take his first step into a different life.]
 22:  400| [47] [Watase]
 23:  401| [45] [(... I'd be lying if I said I didn't have my reservations.)]
 24:  406| [45] [But he still had to do it.]
 25:  411| [45] [He'd reached that conclusion long ago.]
 26:  477| [47] [Watase]
 27:  478| [45] [('Cause I'm the only one... who can avenge Wataru and my folks.)]
 28:  483| [45] [As the only survivor of the Kasasagi family, he would be disgracing his family's memory if he were to give up on his revenge before it even started.]
 29:  488| [45] [That's what he told himself.]
 30:  539| [45] [--It wasn't long before dark clouds hung overhead.]
 31:  544| [47] [Watase]
 32:  545| [45] [(Looks like it's gonna rain...)]
 33:  550| [45] [Since Watase hated getting rained on, he walked over to the nearest bus stop.]
 34:  579| [45] [A bus came by shortly afterwards.]
 35:  630| [45] [He got on to find that it was packed inside.]
 36:  641| [47] [Watase]
 37:  642| [45] [(Maybe I should have taken a cab...)]
 38:  647| [45] [Watase stood between the other passengers as he thought that--]
 39:  652| [45] [--only for his thoughts to be interrupted by the sound of students chatting in the seats nearby.]
 40:  700| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  703| [45] ["Natsuhiko, is there anything you want to buy?"]
 42:  711| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 43:  714| [45] ["No, not in particular..."]
 44:  722| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  725| [45] ["That's a little boring."]
 46:  733| [47] [Mashiro]
 47:  736| [45] ["... I know! Let's pick out clothes for Natsuhiko this time!"]
 48:  744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  747| [45] ["Huh, no, you don't need to."]
 50:  795| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  798| [45] ["Why not? You've actually got some nice looks to start out with, so you can't let it go to waste by being plain all the time."]
 52:  806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  809| [45] ["Whoa there... you don't want to make me your next dress up doll, do you?"]
 54:  817| [47] [Mashiro]
 55:  820| [45] ["Keeheehee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 56:  825| [45] [The boy smiled wryly at the girl's playfulness.]
 57:  830| [45] [Thoughts crossed Watase's mind as he listened to their conversation.]
 58:  835| [47] [Watase]
 59:  836| [45] [(I feel like I've heard that conversation somewhere before...)]
 60:  841| [47] [Watase]
 61:  842| [45] [(Where was it...?)]
 62:  847| [45] [Watase thought about it, and then remembered.]
 63:  918| [47] [Wataru]
 64:  921| [45] ["I know! How about your big sis picks out some clothes for you!?"]
 65:  929| [47] [Watase]
 66:  932| [45] ["Huh, no, you don't need to."]
 67:  958| [47] [Wataru]
 68:  961| [45] ["Why not? You've actually got some nice looks to start out with, so you can't let it go to waste by being plain all the time."]
 69:  969| [47] [Watase]
 70:  972| [45] ["Is that your subtle way of complimenting yourself?"]
 71:  998| [47] [Wataru]
 72: 1001| [45] ["Ehe hee hee, I guess you could look at it that way too."]
 73: 1053| [47] [Watase]
 74: 1054| [45] [(Oh, that's right... this is just like that conversation I had with Wataru back when she was still alive.)]
 75: 1059| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1060| [45] [(... Man, hearing this sure brings me back.)]
 77: 1111| [45] [Just as he started to feel a sense of fellowship with those kids, the girl looked at him.]
 78: 1116| [45] [It was only then that Watase realized it.]
 79: 1129| [45] [The girl was wearing a "Rokumei Academy" uniform-- That was the school where they trained Communicators.]
 80: 1159| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1160| [45] [(--They're Communicators!)]
 82: 1165| [45] [Watase gasped in surprise.]
 83: 1170| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1171| [45] [(Shit... there's a chance a Communicator will read my mind if I open my heart to them.)]
 85: 1223| [45] [--Since they were students of Rokumei Academy, it wouldn't be surprising if they could use empathy.]
 86: 1275| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1276| [45] [(Calm down, keep your mind blank! In the off chance someone reads your mind, the whole plan's doomed to fail!)]
 88: 1281| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1282| [45] [(The members of Q said that "Communicators are an abomination"... and that we have to put an end to this town's history.)]
 90: 1287| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1288| [45] [(Hold on for just a few more days! Don't open your heart to anyone!)]
 92: 1293| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1294| [45] [(I have to work under the assumption that this is a city full of monsters...!)]
 94: 1299| [45] [Watase thought that, then closed his mind.]
 95: 1346| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1347| [45] [(--Abandon your emotions and focus only on carrying out the plan.)]
 97: 1352| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1353| [45] [(For failure will most certainly not be tolerated...)]
 99: 1358| [45] [Watase made that cold vow and kept to it as the next few days passed.]
100: 1388| [45] [Natsuhiko felt sad when he saw that memory.]
101: 1393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1394| [45] [(Watase... is that what you were thinking when you looked at us?)]
103: 1399| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1400| [45] [(So deep down, are you really just a terrorist who hates Communicators?)]
105: 1405| [45] [Those unendurable thoughts raged in Natsuhiko's mind as he continued looking through Watase's memories.]
106: 1410| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1411| [45] [(This is it... next up are his memories of "today"...)]
108: 1416| [45] [Natsuhiko mentally prepared himself.]
109: 1421| [45] [He swore to accept the truth that lay in store for him no matter what it was--]
