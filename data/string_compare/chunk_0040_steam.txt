  0:    1| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 3]
  1:    5| [45] [Jun's face and voice were strained, as if she were trying to hide her fear.]
  2:   10| [47] [Watase]
  3:   11| [45] [(That's right... Moribe's gotta be scared too.)]
  4:   16| [45] ["8650 mSv"--a level of radiation that'd most certainly kill you if you were exposed to it for a mere hour.]
  5:   21| [45] [It was highly unlikely that anyone could look at that number without feeling the slightest ounce of fear.]
  6:   26| [45] [Yet here Jun was, hiding that.]
  7:   31| [47] [Watase]
  8:   32| [45] [(To think a body that small is brimming with so much courage...!)]
  9:   37| [45] [Watase spoke to Jun, making sure to hide his admiration.]
 10:   45| [47] [Watase]
 11:   48| [45] ["... You're right about that. You need two people to go into that contaminated zone or it won't work."]
 12:   56| [47] [Jun]
 13:   59| [45] ["Yeah, you can search much faster that way--"]
 14:   67| [47] [Watase]
 15:   70| [45] ["No, I'm talking about if one of us faints."]
 16:  131| [47] [Jun]
 17:  134| [45] ["!!"]
 18:  142| [47] [Watase]
 19:  145| [45] ["You can't believe that lightning won't strike twice. Just because you didn't faint last time doesn't mean you won't this time either."]
 20:  153| [47] [Watase]
 21:  156| [45] ["That's why two of us need to go. If one of us passes out, the other one can carry them."]
 22:  182| [47] [Jun]
 23:  185| [45] ["So we're putting our lives into each other's hands?"]
 24:  193| [47] [Watase]
 25:  196| [45] ["Yeah, exactly."]
 26:  222| [47] [Jun]
 27:  225| [45] ["... Man, that has a nice ring to it."]
 28:  230| [45] [Jun's strained face slowly changed.]
 29:  235| [45] [A bold smile soon took its place.]
 30:  243| [47] [Jun]
 31:  246| [45] ["Don'tcha know, Captain? They call that the 'buddy system'."]
 32:  254| [47] [Watase]
 33:  257| [45] ["Buddy system?"]
 34:  265| [47] [Jun]
 35:  268| [45] ["It means that we're 'partners'."]
 36:  294| [47] [Jun]
 37:  297| [45] ["Trusting your buddy and having their trust is more important than anything else in our line of work when we're on the job."]
 38:  305| [47] [Jun]
 39:  308| [45] ["The Lieutenant and I are normally buddies-- but today, there's no doubt that you and I are partners."]
 40:  316| [47] [Watase]
 41:  319| [45] ["Partners, huh... that does sound nice."]
 42:  324| [45] [Watase returned Jun's smile.]
 43:  329| [45] [It was likely that their two smiles were mirroring each other.]
 44:  334| [45] [The two of them silently held out their hands, then shared a firm handshake.]
 45:  342| [47] [Watase]
 46:  345| [45] ["... Listen up. We'll limit our search to three minutes."]
 47:  353| [47] [Watase]
 48:  356| [45] ["If we run out of time, then drop whatever you're doing and get back here."]
 49:  382| [47] [Jun]
 50:  385| [45] ["Yeah, that time limit sounds about right. It'll all be for nothing if we both pass out, after all."]
 51:  393| [47] [Watase]
 52:  396| [45] ["Also, make sure to keep this a secret from Tachibana."]
 53:  422| [47] [Jun]
 54:  425| [45] ["You don't even have to ask! I don't want to give her another thing to worry about!"]
 55:  430| [45] [Watase and Jun set their watch timers to three minutes, then turned back to the gate.]
 56:  438| [47] [Watase]
 57:  441| [45] ["Okay, ready to go, partner!?"]
 58:  467| [47] [Jun]
 59:  470| [45] ["YEAH!"]
 60:  518| [45] [They both let out a gallant cry and charged straight into the contaminated zone.]
