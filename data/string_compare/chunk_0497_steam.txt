  0:   75| [45] [One afternoon--]
  1:   80| [45] [Jun and Nagisa went out to Center Street to do some shopping.]
  2:   85| [45] [They wanted to give Kazami a present as thanks for always working so hard.]
  3:  114| [45] [The two girls talked as they looked at the shops that lined the street.]
  4:  122| [47] [Jun]
  5:  125| [45] ["Hmm, what should we buy?"]
  6:  151| [47] [Nagisa]
  7:  154| [45] ["What do you think Sis would like?"]
  8:  162| [47] [Jun]
  9:  165| [45] ["Come to think of it, Kazami's so pretty, yet she doesn't wear all that much trendy stuff, does she?"]
 10:  173| [47] [Jun]
 11:  176| [45] ["I think an accessory or something'd look great on her."]
 12:  202| [47] [Nagisa]
 13:  205| [45] ["That sounds good. Then what should we get?"]
 14:  231| [47] [Nagisa]
 15:  234| [45] ["Earrings? Or maybe a ring?"]
 16:  242| [47] [Jun]
 17:  245| [45] ["Hmm... oh, I know, then how about that one thing?"]
 18:  253| [47] [Jun]
 19:  256| [45] ["You know that, uh, that necklace thingy that pops open."]
 20:  282| [47] [Nagisa]
 21:  285| [45] ["Pops open?"]
 22:  293| [47] [Jun]
 23:  296| [45] ["Y'know, that thing people put photos in and wear around their neck."]
 24:  322| [47] [Nagisa]
 25:  325| [45] ["You mean a locket?"]
 26:  333| [47] [Jun]
 27:  336| [45] ["Yeah, that's the one!"]
 28:  341| [45] [Nagisa was a very smart girl for her age-- she hadn't even started elementary school,%Nyet she was more knowledgeable than Jun.]
 29:  346| [45] [Jun hated studying, so it didn't bother her at all that Nagisa was so much smarter.]
 30:  354| [47] [Jun]
 31:  357| [45] ["If we got her a locket, she could probably put a photo of you in it."]
 32:  365| [47] [Jun]
 33:  368| [45] ["Then your sis could always be with you."]
 34:  394| [47] [Nagisa]
 35:  397| [45] ["I see. Yeah, that's a great idea!"]
 36:  405| [47] [Jun]
 37:  408| [45] ["Okay, then let's find us a locket!"]
 38:  413| [45] [Jun and Nagisa checked around the accessory shops.]
 39:  465| [45] [They finally found a locket in the third one they went to.]
 40:  470| [45] [It cost 3500 yen.]
 41:  475| [45] [Jun said she'd cover the whole cost, but--]
 42:  507| [47] [Nagisa]
 43:  510| [45] ["No Jun, I think I should pay half."]
 44:  518| [47] [Jun]
 45:  521| [45] ["Huh, y'sure about that?"]
 46:  547| [47] [Nagisa]
 47:  550| [45] ["I've saved up my allowance, and I'd feel bad about making you pay for it all."]
 48:  558| [47] [Jun]
 49:  561| [45] ["Okay, that does sound better. Then it can be like a present from the both of us."]
 50:  587| [47] [Nagisa]
 51:  590| [45] ["Right? So we'll each pay 1750 yen..."]
 52:  598| [47] [Jun]
 53:  601| [45] ["... And buy this locket!"]
 54:  655| [45] [And so the two of them obtained Kazami's present.]
 55:  728| [45] [They chatted on their way back to the Tachibana residence.]
 56:  754| [47] [Nagisa]
 57:  757| [45] ["You think Sis will like it?"]
 58:  765| [47] [Jun]
 59:  768| [45] ["You kidding? I bet she'll be moved to tears by it."]
 60:  776| [47] [Jun]
 61:  779| [45] ["'Cause Kazami loves you so much."]
 62:  805| [47] [Nagisa]
 63:  808| [45] ["R-really?"]
 64:  813| [45] [Nagisa said that with embarrassment. It looked as if she was aware of how much her sister loved her.]
 65:  818| [45] [Jun suddenly got jealous when she saw that.]
 66:  826| [47] [Jun]
 67:  829| [45] ["... You're so lucky that you have such a nice sister, Nagisa."]
 68:  855| [47] [Nagisa]
 69:  858| [45] ["Huh?"]
 70:  866| [47] [Jun]
 71:  869| [45] ["No one in my family gets along... I always hate being in that house."]
 72:  877| [47] [Jun]
 73:  880| [45] ["Daddy rarely comes home, Mommy's always going off somewhere, and all my meals are made by my housekeeper."]
 74:  888| [47] [Jun]
 75:  891| [45] ["... I just feel so lonely sometimes."]
 76:  899| [47] [Jun]
 77:  902| [45] ["I don't need a big house. I just want my family to get along... just like you and your sis do."]
 78:  925| [47] [Nagisa]
 79:  926| [45] ["..."]
 80:  934| [47] [Jun]
 81:  937| [45] ["... Forget I said that. Sorry, I don't know what the heck got into me!"]
 82:  945| [47] [Jun]
 83:  948| [45] ["Boy, it must have been a real pain to hear me whine like that."]
 84:  953| [45] [Just when Jun started to get embarrassed about complaining to a 6 year old-- Nagisa spoke up with determination in her voice.]
 85: 1007| [47] [Nagisa]
 86: 1010| [45] ["... Th-then you should live with us too!"]
 87: 1018| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1021| [45] ["Huh?"]
 89: 1047| [47] [Nagisa]
 90: 1050| [45] ["I like you, and I'm sure Sis likes you too."]
 91: 1058| [47] [Nagisa]
 92: 1061| [45] ["If you lived with us, then the three of us could be one happy family! You wouldn't be lonely at all!"]
 93: 1069| [47] [Jun]
 94: 1072| [45] ["Nagisa..."]
 95: 1077| [45] [Jun stared at Nagisa, who looked absolutely pleased with herself.]
 96: 1082| [47] [Jun]
 97: 1083| [45] [(Ah... stupid me, I made a little girl worry about me...)]
 98: 1088| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1089| [45] [(She's trying to be so nice to me even though she's got no mom or dad. She must be just as lonely, but she still...)]
100: 1094| [45] [It was a proposal that made her feel so pathetic, yet it also sounded so charming.]
101: 1102| [47] [Jun]
102: 1105| [45] ["... That'd be nice. Then I guess that'd make you my little sister?"]
103: 1131| [47] [Nagisa]
104: 1134| [45] ["Yep. Then that'd mean I'd have two big sisters."]
105: 1142| [47] [Jun]
106: 1145| [45] ["Then when Kazami gets married..."]
107: 1171| [47] [Nagisa]
108: 1174| [45] ["Her husband would be my Daddy. Then I'd have a complete family, right?"]
109: 1179| [45] [That's not exactly how it worked, but it was a very joyful dream nonetheless.]
110: 1184| [45] [Kazami would definitely make a good mom.]
111: 1189| [45] [Her cooking was also top-class. Her husband would no doubt be a wonderful man.]
112: 1194| [45] [Once she got married, Kazami would be free from her day to day job. Then Nagisa could act more like a child of her age.]
113: 1199| [45] [Jun imagined that ideal family in her head.]
114: 1204| [47] [Jun]
115: 1205| [45] [(An outsider like me shouldn't even be there to begin with, but...)]
116: 1210| [45] [Though she knew that, she thought it wouldn't be so bad to immerse herself in that dream.]
117: 1218| [47] [Jun]
118: 1221| [45] ["... Then maybe this present will be just the ticket Kazami needs to snag a hubby?"]
119: 1247| [47] [Nagisa]
120: 1250| [45] ["Yeah!"]
121: 1258| [47] [Jun]
122: 1261| [45] ["All right! Then let's head on home and give this to her!"]
123: 1266| [45] [The two friends then broke off into a run.]
124: 1314| [45] [--Kazami had told Nagisa that she got off work early that day, so she'd be home around 3 PM.]
125: 1319| [45] [So Jun and Nagisa waited in the Tachibana residence for Kazami to get home.]
126: 1342| [45] [Nagisa kept on glancing at the clock, muttering "is it time yet?" to herself.]
127: 1349| [45] [But when the bell chimed 3 PM--]
128: 1514| [45] [It was drowned out by a thunderous roar.]
129: 1522| [47] [Jun]
130: 1525| [45] ["!?"]
131: 1536| [45] [A shock ran through the building, and Jun heard what sounded like something collapsing.]
132: 1591| [45] [A second later, she was struck by an impact--]
133: 1596| [45] [Then passed out.]
134: 1611| [45] [------]
135: 1616| [45] [----]
136: 1621| [45] [--]
137: 1756| [47] [Jun]
138: 1759| [45] ["..."]
139: 1767| [47] [Jun]
140: 1770| [45] ["U-ugh..."]
141: 1775| [45] [Jun woke up to find she was lying face down under something heavy.]
142: 1780| [45] [Her back was being crushed under the weight of what appeared to be rough debris.]
143: 1788| [47] [Jun]
144: 1791| [45] ["Wha... what's going on...!?"]
145: 1796| [45] [Jun was at a complete loss. She had absolutely no idea what had happened.]
146: 1801| [45] [All she knew was that her body was pinned down by something, and she could see little apart from the floor.]
147: 1806| [45] [Nagisa was supposed to be right next to her, but she was nowhere to be found.]
148: 1814| [47] [Jun]
149: 1817| [45] ["N-Nagisa... where are you...?"]
150: 1822| [45] [Her calls were answered by another voice somewhere in the room.]
151: 1830| [47] [Nagisa]
152: 1833| [45] ["J... Jun... are... you okay...?"]
153: 1841| [47] [Jun]
154: 1844| [45] ["N-Nagisa...!"]
155: 1849| [45] [Jun tried to hurry over towards Nagisa.]
156: 1875| [45] [But she couldn't make the debris budge at all no matter how hard she struggled.]
157: 1883| [47] [Jun]
158: 1886| [45] ["H-huh!? Why...!?"]
159: 1894| [47] [Nagisa]
160: 1897| [45] ["S-something blew up... I think the ceiling fell down..."]
161: 1905| [47] [Jun]
162: 1908| [45] ["Blew up!? Nagisa, are you okay!?"]
163: 1916| [47] [Nagisa]
164: 1919| [45] ["I-I can't move either..."]
165: 1927| [47] [Nagisa]
166: 1930| [45] ["I think... I cut my head... I'm bleeding..."]
167: 1938| [47] [Nagisa]
168: 1941| [45] ["... It hurts..."]
169: 1949| [47] [Jun]
170: 1952| [45] ["Nagisa...!"]
171: 1957| [45] [Jun desperately tried to squirm her way out from under the debris.]
172: 1983| [45] [But the debris weighing on her back creaked every time she moved, sounding as though it would collapse at any second.]
173: 1988| [47] [Jun]
174: 1989| [45] [(Th-that sounded way too close... If this thing collapses, I'll be...!)]
175: 2000| [45] [Just then, she heard ambulance sirens in the distance getting closer and closer.]
176: 2008| [47] [Jun]
177: 2011| [45] ["An ambulance..."]
178: 2019| [47] [Nagisa]
179: 2022| [45] ["Yeah..."]
180: 2030| [47] [Jun]
181: 2033| [45] ["I'm sure help is on the way right now. We just need to hang in there..."]
182: 2041| [47] [Nagisa]
183: 2044| [45] ["... Yeah..."]
184: 2049| [45] [Jun and Nagisa held still and waited in the dark room for help to arrive.]
185: 2054| [45] [--...]
186: 2059| [45] [---...]
187: 2064| [45] [----...]
188: 2069| [45] [-----...]
189: 2082| [45] [... But they were taking a long time to get there.]
190: 2087| [45] [Jun talked as much as she could to keep Nagisa calm.]
191: 2095| [47] [Jun]
192: 2098| [45] ["Hey, Nagisa..."]
193: 2114| [47] [Nagisa]
194: 2117| [45] ["Jun...? What is it...?"]
195: 2125| [47] [Jun]
196: 2128| [45] ["Umm... 'bout what we were talking about before..."]
197: 2144| [47] [Nagisa]
198: 2147| [45] ["What we were talking about...?"]
199: 2155| [47] [Jun]
200: 2158| [45] ["Y'know, the thing about me becoming a part of your family..."]
201: 2174| [47] [Jun]
202: 2177| [45] ["... I was just thinking that if that really did happen... it'd probably be so much fun..."]
203: 2185| [47] [Nagisa]
204: 2188| [45] ["Yeah... I'm sure it would be..."]
205: 2193| [47] [Nagisa]
206: 2194| [45] ["..."]
207: 2210| [47] [Nagisa]
208: 2213| [45] ["... Hey, Jun..."]
209: 2221| [47] [Jun]
210: 2224| [45] ["Huh...?"]
211: 2232| [47] [Nagisa]
212: 2235| [45] ["You said you got lonely from time to time earlier..."]
213: 2251| [47] [Nagisa]
214: 2254| [45] ["The thing is, I'm a little lonely too... 'cause I don't have a mom or dad..."]
215: 2262| [47] [Nagisa]
216: 2265| [45] ["So I can't help myself sometimes when Sis is away at work..."]
217: 2281| [47] [Nagisa]
218: 2284| [45] ["So I figured I wouldn't be lonely anymore if you became my big sis too--"]
219: 2289| [45] [Her frail voice was abruptly cut off.]
220: 2305| [47] [Nagisa]
221: 2308| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
222: 2316| [47] [Jun]
223: 2319| [45] ["!? Nagisa, what's wrong!?"]
224: 2335| [47] [Nagisa]
225: 2338| [45] ["Sm... smoke..."]
226: 2346| [47] [Nagisa]
227: 2349| [45] ["I think there's a fire somewhere...!"]
228: 2362| [45] [Upon hearing that, Jun suddenly noticed.]
229: 2367| [45] [Without her realizing it, their surroundings had become enshrouded by the burning stench of smoke.]
230: 2372| [45] [--No, that wasn't all.]
231: 2377| [45] [The debris weighing on her back was starting to get hotter and hotter.]
232: 2382| [47] [Jun]
233: 2383| [45] [(It... it burns!)]
234: 2388| [45] [The debris crushing Jun was on fire. That was the source of the heat and stench.]
235: 2393| [45] [Fear instantly ran through her.]
236: 2398| [47] [Jun]
237: 2399| [45] [(Th-this is bad! My back's gonna get burned--!)]
238: 2425| [45] [Jun instinctively twisted her body.]
239: 2453| [45] [Right at that moment, the debris collapsed, and something searing hot landed on her back.]
240: 2533| [47] [Jun]
241: 2536| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!"]
242: 2544| [47] [Nagisa]
243: 2547| [45] ["J-Jun!?"]
244: 2621| [47] [Jun]
245: 2624| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAH! It burns! It burns! It burns!! Igh, ghhiii, AAAAAAAAAAAGH!"]
246: 2629| [45] [It seemed a scorching hot reinforcing bar or something like that was pressing against her back.]
247: 2634| [45] [It instantly burned through Jun's clothes and charred her skin.]
248: 2639| [45] [Jun gritted her teeth and twisted her body, managing to get the rebar off her back somehow.]
249: 2644| [45] [However, the heat and torturous pain didn't go away.]
250: 2661| [47] [Jun]
251: 2664| [45] ["Haah, haah, haaah...!"]
252: 2672| [47] [Nagisa]
253: 2675| [45] ["A-are you okay...?"]
254: 2683| [47] [Jun]
255: 2686| [45] ["I'm okay... don't worry..."]
256: 2691| [45] [Thoughts ran through Jun's mind as she panted heavily.]
257: 2696| [45] [Now that the small room was on fire, help needed to get there, and fast. If it didn't--%Nthen she and Nagisa were both dead.]
258: 2704| [47] [Jun]
259: 2707| [45] ["S... someone!! Someone help us!!"]
260: 2715| [47] [Jun]
261: 2718| [45] ["Two of us are still trapped here!"]
262: 2723| [45] [Jun hoarsely screamed those words.]
263: 2728| [45] [Nagisa also weakly rose her voice.]
264: 2736| [47] [Nagisa]
265: 2739| [45] ["S-someone..."]
266: 2747| [47] [Nagisa]
267: 2750| [45] [{He... help us...}]
268: 2758| [47] [Jun]
269: 2761| [45] ["Two of us are trapped here!"]
270: 2769| [47] [Nagisa]
271: 2772| [45] [{We're... in apartment 303...}]
272: 2780| [47] [Nagisa]
273: 2783| [45] [{Hurry... the fire's...}]
274: 2791| [47] [Jun]
275: 2794| [45] ["The fire's getting close! Someone--"]
276: 2802| [47] [Jun]
277: 2805| [45] ["*cough*! *cough* *cough*!"]
278: 2810| [45] [Jun then broke out into a violent coughing fit.]
279: 2815| [45] [Though she'd avoided it so far because she'd been pinned to the floor, the fumes finally started flooding into Jun's mouth.]
280: 2823| [47] [Jun]
281: 2826| [45] ["So... someone..."]
282: 2833| [45] [With those final words, Jun started to pass out. However--]
283: 2844| [45] [She heard the sound of the front door opening up.]
284: 2850| [47] [Jun]
285: 2851| [45] [(!?)]
286: 2856| [45] [Jun was taken aback. The sound was then replaced by human voices.]
287: 2870| [47] [Watase]
288: 2873| [45] ["I... I've located a survivor!!"]
289: 2878| [47] [Jun]
290: 2879| [45] [(He... help's finally... here...?)]
291: 2884| [45] [Though she was barely even conscious, Jun turned towards the voice.]
292: 2895| [45] [Just then, the debris blocking her vision was removed, revealing someone's shadow.]
293: 2990| [47] [Watase]
294: 2993| [45] ["You okay!?"]
295: 3001| [47] [Jun]
296: 3004| [45] ["Ugh..."]
297: 3009| [45] [Jun couldn't answer.]
298: 3014| [45] [But the man gave her a reassuring smile.]
299: 3099| [47] [Watase]
300: 3102| [45] ["You did such a good job hanging in there. But you're safe now."]
301: 3107| [47] [Jun]
302: 3108| [45] ["..."]
303: 3113| [45] [Jun managed to give him a faint smile of her own.]
304: 3118| [45] [The man had showed up to save Jun and Nagisa just in the nick of time-- like he was some sort of hero straight out of a movie or something.]
305: 3123| [45] [She heard another man's voice coming from the corner of the room.]
306: 3128| [47] [Dojima]
307: 3131| [45] ["There's another one over here!"]
308: 3139| [47] [Watase]
309: 3142| [45] ["Good! Two survivors secured!"]
310: 3150| [47] [Watase]
311: 3153| [45] ["Hey missy, is there anyone else in this place!?"]
312: 3161| [47] [Jun]
313: 3164| [45] ["N... no... just me... and... Nagisa..."]
314: 3172| [47] [Watase]
315: 3175| [45] ["Thanks! Then just hold on, I'll get you out of there on the double!"]
316: 3221| [45] [The man shouted that, then moved the debris on Jun's back aside--]
317: 3227| [45] [And a second later, he pulled Jun out. She had been saved.]
318: 3345| [45] [The man carried Jun down the creaking hallway.]
319: 3350| [45] [She could see another man a short distance behind them carrying Nagisa.]
320: 3358| [47] [Jun]
321: 3361| [45] ["I... is Nagisa... okay...?"]
322: 3388| [47] [Watase]
323: 3391| [45] ["Nagisa? You mean that other girl?"]
324: 3399| [47] [Jun]
325: 3402| [45] ["Yeah... she's my... sister..."]
326: 3429| [47] [Watase]
327: 3432| [45] ["!? Your sister?"]
328: 3437| [45] [The man behind them then answered Jun's question.]
329: 3442| [47] [Dojima]
330: 3445| [45] ["Don't you worry, missy. Nagisa's safe and sound."]
331: 3450| [47] [Dojima]
332: 3453| [45] ["She's unconscious right now, but her life shouldn't be in any danger."]
333: 3480| [47] [Watase]
334: 3483| [45] ["... See? You don't have to worry."]
335: 3491| [47] [Jun]
336: 3494| [45] ["I see..."]
337: 3499| [45] [At that moment, she suddenly felt her throat hurting from all the smoke she'd been inhaling just minutes ago.]
338: 3507| [47] [Jun]
339: 3510| [45] ["Ugh... *cough* *cough*..."]
340: 3537| [47] [Watase]
341: 3540| [45] ["Are you okay!? I'm gonna get you to a safe place soon, so just hold on tight!"]
342: 3548| [47] [Jun]
343: 3551| [45] ["B-but... it hurts..."]
344: 3559| [47] [Jun]
345: 3562| [45] ["My back... my head... my eyes... they all hurt so much..."]
346: 3570| [47] [Jun]
347: 3573| [45] ["Am I... gonna die...?"]
348: 3578| [45] [Now that she'd confirmed Nagisa was safe, she suddenly felt so weak.]
349: 3583| [45] [But the man answered her in an encouraging voice.]
350: 3610| [47] [Watase]
351: 3613| [45] ["No, don't you worry. I'll never let you die. Never."]
352: 3621| [47] [Jun]
353: 3624| [45] ["Huh...?"]
354: 3651| [47] [Watase]
355: 3654| [45] ["We're rescue workers. We came to save you guys."]
356: 3662| [47] [Watase]
357: 3665| [45] ["We won't let you die now that we're here."]
358: 3670| [47] [Jun]
359: 3671| [45] [(Rescue workers...?)]
360: 3676| [45] [Now that she thought about it, she had heard of them before.]
361: 3681| [45] [She'd learned somewhere that there were firefighters in the city who specialized at saving people's lives.]
362: 3711| [47] [Jun]
363: 3712| [45] [(... I see, so that's... how they were able to save us like it was nothing...)]
364: 3717| [47] [Jun]
365: 3718| [45] [(Rescue workers are real amazing...)]
366: 3723| [47] [Jun]
367: 3724| [45] [(If I had that kind of strength too... I could have helped Nagisa sooner...)]
368: 3786| [45] [And with that thought--]
369: 3791| [45] [Jun once again lost consciousness.]
