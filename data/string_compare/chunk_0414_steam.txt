  1:  334| [86] [Where has your beloved gone?]
  2:  335| [86] [Which way did your beloved turn,]
  3:  336| [86] [That we may look for them with you?]
  4:  337| [86] [(The Old Testament / Song of Solomon 6:1)]
  5:  339| [45] [--Early afternoon, September 19, 2030--]
  6:  344| [45] [Three days after the incident.]
  7:  349| [45] [At the "White Tiger Gate", one of the gates that surrounded Rokumei City,]
  8:  374| [45] [a woman stood alone.]
  9:  379| [45] [There were circles beneath her eyes, and her expression also revealed the slightest hints of exhaustion.]
 10:  384| [45] [But a fierce will shone in her eyes.]
 11:  391| [45] [--It wasn't long before she heard the sound of a car engine driving towards her from the other side.]
 12:  402| [45] [The car passed through the gate, then drove up next to the woman and stopped.]
 13:  407| [45] [It was a red French sedan. The driver's door opened, revealing a woman in a suit.]
 14:  446| [47] [Ena]
 15:  449| [45] ["Thank you for all your hard work, Dr. Tenkawa."]
 16:  454| [45] [The woman quickly replied to Ena's greeting.]
 17:  480| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  483| [45] ["Thank you for taking the trouble to come here, Commissioner Tsubakiyama."]
 19:  488| [45] [The woman-- Miyoko Tenkawa-- had received a call from Ena and waited for her to arrive at the city gate.]
 20:  493| [45] [Not to be outdone by Miyoko, Ena's face looked just as exhausted.]
 21:  498| [45] [But anyone could see that her eyes matched Miyoko's in intensity.]
 22:  524| [47] [Ena]
 23:  527| [45] ["It's been a long time since we've met in person, hasn't it? How are things on your end?"]
 24:  553| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  556| [45] ["Dealing with the whole aftermath without sleep or rest is starting to catch up to me."]
 26:  582| [47] [Ena]
 27:  585| [45] ["I thought so... You look quite worn out."]
 28:  611| [47] [Miyoko]
 29:  614| [45] ["Oh no, this is nothing... It's a trivial matter compared to the suffering those children have been through."]
 30:  637| [47] [Ena]
 31:  638| [45] ["..."]
 32:  664| [47] [Miyoko]
 33:  667| [45] ["Incidentally, if you don't mind me asking, how are they doing...?"]
 34:  693| [47] [Ena]
 35:  696| [45] ["Please rest assured. Your son and everyone else are in the custody of the ESP Bureau--"]
 36:  722| [47] [Ena]
 37:  725| [45] ["Their injuries are currently being treated at a safe place."]
 38:  751| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  754| [45] ["Thank goodness... and thank you."]
 40:  780| [47] [Ena]
 41:  783| [45] ["No, it's only a matter of course."]
 42:  809| [47] [Ena]
 43:  812| [45] ["Though the situation has gotten much worse as a result of how slow we at the ESP Bureau were to act."]
 44:  838| [47] [Miyoko]
 45:  841| [45] ["Don't be ridiculous... When you get down to it, this incident was entirely our responsibility, and by extension, my own."]
 46:  849| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  852| [45] ["You see, I had considered trying to save the test subjects, but in the end, I could just never bring myself to act."]
 48:  857| [45] [Miyoko looked down in shame when she said that.]
 49:  865| [47] [Miyoko]
 50:  868| [45] ["... And in the end... one of them never made it out alive..."]
 51:  894| [47] [Ena]
 52:  897| [45] ["... You mean Ms. Nagisa, don't you?"]
 53:  905| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  908| [45] ["Yes... I may not have been in charge of her, but even so--"]
 55:  916| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  919| [45] ["I had hoped that I could someday let her go free into the outside world along with Yuuri and Yui."]
 57:  924| [45] [Miyoko gritted her teeth.]
 58:  930| [45] [Ena took her hand and spoke.]
 59:  957| [47] [Ena]
 60:  960| [45] ["Professor... I know how you feel."]
 61:  986| [47] [Ena]
 62:  989| [45] ["But the time for regrets will have to wait for later. Now's not the time."]
 63:  997| [47] [Ena]
 64: 1000| [45] ["There is much we have to do, after all."]
 65: 1026| [47] [Miyoko]
 66: 1029| [45] ["... You're right."]
 67: 1034| [45] [Miyoko gripped Ena's hand back and spoke.]
 68: 1060| [47] [Miyoko]
 69: 1063| [45] ["To avenge Nagisa and the others."]
 70: 1071| [47] [Ena]
 71: 1074| [45] ["And to ensure closure for everyone whose lives were trampled on or snuffed out along the way--"]
 72: 1138| [45] [Suddenly, Miyoko heard more cars approaching from beyond the city gate.]
 73: 1143| [45] [There wasn't just one or two of them.]
 74: 1148| [45] [Over ten cars filled with members of the ESP Bureau passed through the gates and invaded Rokumei City.]
 75: 1174| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1177| [45] ["--Let's begin. It's time to clean up this city."]
 77: 1203| [47] [Miyoko]
 78: 1206| [45] ["Yes."]
 79: 1255| [45] [The women then looked to the city.]
 80: 1260| [45] [Spread out before them was the townscape of the government designated top-secret city swirling with deceit and malice.]
 81: 1348| [45] [--The incident that had occurred in the 6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization--]
 82: 1353| [45] [had sparked a worldwide phenomenon.]
 83: 1390| [45] [And with that, the many incidents that had occurred and been covered-up over the last sixteen years had all been brought to light one after another, starting with the truth behind LABO.]
 84: 1395| [45] [Now that they couldn't return to Rokumei City, Natsuhiko and the others were spread out all over the country after the incident to elude their pursuers' eyes.]
 85: 1440| [45] [They all then set out on all sorts of new ventures.]
 86: 1641| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and Salyu appealed to public opinion through the media by revealing the truth they had seen as living witnesses of the incident.]
 87: 1784| [45] [Watase and Ukita were tried as terrorists by the law-- but their sentences were greatly reduced as compensation for their full cooperation in exterminating Q.]
 88: 1852| [45] [Jun made a direct appeal to her father, one of the city council members, and took action to drastically restructure Rokumei City.]
 89: 1884| [45] [The journey was a long one, but Kazami supported Jun all the way.]
 90: 2003| [45] [Finally, Ena and Dr. Tenkawa stayed in Rokumei City together and fully cooperated with the ESP Bureau's full investigation into LABO and the Rokumei City government's other offenses.]
 91: 2034| [45] [Ukita joined them once he was released from prison, and together they worked to ensure that someday, they could establish a BC research facility rooted in social justice.]
 92: 2067| [45] [Chaos reigned through society for a while, but it gradually calmed down--]
 93: 2072| [45] [And peace began to return to the world...]
 94: 2161| [45] [--These are fragments of the memories...]
 95: 2166| [45] [... that took place over that year.]
