  1:   66| [45] [After knocking out Ena, Watase headed towards the heart of LABO.]
  2:   71| [45] [Apparently, he intended to put out the fires in the nuclear reactor area all by himself.]
  3:   76| [45] [Natsuhiko desperately tried to stop him.]
  4:   84| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:   87| [45] [{Stop it, you dumbass! You'll die!}]
  6:   95| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:   98| [45] [{You can't put out the fire of a burning nuclear reactor all by yourself!}]
  8:  106| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  109| [45] [{Even if you could, you'd be exposed to radiation for sure!}]
 10:  117| [47] [Watase]
 11:  120| [45] ["Someone's gotta do it."]
 12:  128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  131| [45] [{You wanna die that badly!? Are you really okay with dying if it means saving everyone else!?}]
 14:  139| [47] [Watase]
 15:  142| [45] ["It's not that I want to die. I just want to save everyone, that's all."]
 16:  150| [47] [Watase]
 17:  153| [45] ["... Wanting to save people's been the one constant for me this whole time."]
 18:  161| [47] [Watase]
 19:  164| [45] ["It was all because you told me to save Yuuri way back when this all began."]
 20:  169| [45] [Watase muttered as if he were talking to himself. Natsuhiko listened silently.]
 21:  177| [47] [Watase]
 22:  180| [45] ["So... all I want to do is fulfill my role."]
 23:  188| [47] [Watase]
 24:  191| [45] ["I hated feeling so powerless, surrounded by nothing but fire, explosions, and smoke."]
 25:  199| [47] [Watase]
 26:  202| [45] ["When we didn't have enough AD, I went running straight into gas and a contaminated zone."]
 27:  210| [47] [Watase]
 28:  213| [45] ["When someone fell into a hole, I grabbed their hand and pulled them out."]
 29:  221| [47] [Watase]
 30:  224| [45] ["I protected Yuuri with my body when the debris threatened to crush her..."]
 31:  232| [47] [Watase]
 32:  235| [45] ["This whole time, all I've ever thought about is how to save everyone."]
 33:  240| [45] [The moment Watase said that--]
 34:  415| [45] [Drowsiness began to eat away at Natsuhiko's consciousness once more.]
 35:  420| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  421| [45] [(Khh...)]
 37:  426| [45] [He could tell that this time, he was fighting a losing battle to stay conscious.]
 38:  431| [45] [He would probably disappear soon after this.]
 39:  436| [45] [Watase's voice echoed as Natsuhiko's hearing deafened.]
 40:  444| [47] [Watase]
 41:  447| [45] ["... I'll be damned if I let the others die because of my actions."]
 42:  455| [47] [Watase]
 43:  458| [45] ["And the same goes for letting anyone die because I did nothing."]
 44:  466| [47] [Watase]
 45:  469| [45] ["If putting out the reactor fires will save everyone, then I'll do it."]
 46:  477| [47] [Watase]
 47:  480| [45] ["Even if..."]
 48:  485| [45] [--Even if I lose my life as a result.]
 49:  490| [45] [Watase's silent determination could be felt even in Natsuhiko's consciousness.]
 50:  495| [45] [There was no lie, nor bluff, nor pretense in Watase's mind.]
 51:  500| [45] [Only the unadulterated desire to save everyone.]
 52:  508| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  511| [45] [{.. Watase... you...}]
 54:  516| [45] [But once Natsuhiko said those words, he finally reached his time limit--...]
 55:  521| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  522| [45] [(Ah, dammit...)]
 57:  527| [45] [Natsuhiko cursed. He couldn't help but curse.]
 58:  532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  533| [45] [(... If only you were like that from the start.)]
 60:  538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 61:  539| [45] [(If only you were a righteous rescue worker, then neither me, nor Mashiro, nor Salyu would've had to suffer like this...!)]
 62:  686| [47] [Watase]
 63:  689| [45] ["... That's me. That's Watase Kasasagi."]
 64:  697| [47] [Watase]
 65:  700| [45] ["Burn that name into your ears. Carve it into your mind. Reflect on that name until the moment you die!!"]
 66:  850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  851| [45] [(--Why, Watase? Why...?)]
 68:  856| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  857| [45] [(What made you become a terrorist?)]
 70:  862| [45] [That was the one question Natsuhiko found vexing.]
 71: 1030| [45] [Watase's voice echoed from far away.]
 72: 1038| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1041| [45] ["You get it now? If you do, then shut up."]
 74: 1049| [47] [Watase]
 75: 1052| [45] ["... If you keep talking, I might lose my resolve."]
 76: 1057| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1058| [45] [(... Okay, I get it.)]
 78: 1063| [45] [Natsuhiko calmly prayed.]
 79: 1068| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1069| [45] [(I'll leave the rest to you.)]
 81: 1074| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1075| [45] [(I'm leaving Salyu, that girl, and Prof. Tsubakiyama all in your care, okay...?)]
 83: 1080| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1081| [45] [(... So please. Don't let me down.)]
 85: 1086| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1087| [45] [(Okay, Watase...?)]
