  0:   65| [45] [--It was the night of September 14.]
  1:   70| [45] [A memory of when Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Salyu stayed overnight at a karaoke box...]
  2:   75| [45] [--...]
  3:  123| [47] [Salyu]
  4:  126| [45] ["...?"]
  5:  131| [45] [--Right as she fell asleep, Salyu heard something and woke up.]
  6:  136| [45] [When she looked around, she couldn't find Natsuhiko.]
  7:  141| [47] [Salyu]
  8:  144| [45] ["... Natsuhiko?"]
  9:  149| [45] [No answer.]
 10:  154| [47] [Salyu]
 11:  157| [45] ["Where did he go...?"]
 12:  162| [45] [After she muttered that, she heard a voice right beside her.]
 13:  196| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  199| [45] ["... He probably went to make a phone call."]
 15:  204| [47] [Salyu]
 16:  207| [45] ["!"]
 17:  212| [45] [It was Mashiro.]
 18:  217| [45] [Salyu thought she was asleep, but it appeared that wasn't the case.]
 19:  222| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  225| [45] ["A phone call? To whom?"]
 21:  251| [47] [Mashiro]
 22:  254| [45] ["To Yuuri..."]
 23:  280| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  283| [45] ["Natsuhiko's rarely out of the house at night, see."]
 25:  291| [47] [Mashiro]
 26:  294| [45] ["So whenever he is out, he gets worried about Yuuri and calls her."]
 27:  299| [47] [Salyu]
 28:  302| [45] ["... Even though she's not there?"]
 29:  328| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  331| [45] ["Even though she's not there. But he does hear her voice through the phone."]
 31:  336| [47] [Salyu]
 32:  339| [45] ["I see..."]
 33:  344| [45] [Salyu fell silent after saying that.]
 34:  349| [45] [She rarely got the opportunity to talk with Mashiro alone.]
 35:  354| [45] [So she decided to take advantage of the situation and ask her some questions.]
 36:  359| [47] [Salyu]
 37:  362| [45] ["... Um, Mashiro."]
 38:  388| [47] [Mashiro]
 39:  391| [45] ["What?"]
 40:  396| [47] [Salyu]
 41:  399| [45] ["What kind of girl was Yuuri?"]
 42:  425| [47] [Mashiro]
 43:  428| [45] ["Well..."]
 44:  433| [45] [Mashiro thought for a little before answering.]
 45:  459| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  462| [45] ["She was cute, and super, super gentle... She was the girl I admired."]
 47:  467| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  470| [45] ["What was she like to Natsuhiko?"]
 49:  496| [47] [Mashiro]
 50:  499| [45] ["She was a little different to Natsuhiko, I guess."]
 51:  507| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  510| [45] ["She wasn't really the girl he admired, but more the girl he wanted to protect."]
 53:  536| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  539| [45] ["... But he couldn't protect her in the end."]
 55:  547| [47] [Mashiro]
 56:  550| [45] ["Since Natsuhiko couldn't accept that reality... time has stopped for him to back when Yuuri was still alive."]
 57:  555| [47] [Salyu]
 58:  556| [45] ["..."]
 59:  561| [45] [Mashiro's use of roundabout expressions was hard for Salyu to understand, but she caught the gist of what she meant.]
 60:  566| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  569| [45] ["Natsuhiko still loves Yuuri, doesn't he?"]
 62:  577| [47] [Mashiro]
 63:  580| [45] ["Yeah... you're right..."]
 64:  585| [47] [Salyu]
 65:  588| [45] ["Mashiro, do you still love Yuuri?"]
 66:  614| [47] [Mashiro]
 67:  617| [45] ["Of course I love her... but not in the same way as Natsuhiko, though."]
 68:  643| [47] [Mashiro]
 69:  646| [45] ["... Maybe it's too early for you to understand that sorta thing, huh?"]
 70:  651| [47] [Salyu]
 71:  654| [45] ["Of course not. Probably."]
 72:  680| [47] [Mashiro]
 73:  683| [45] ["Huh? Wait... Salyu, don't tell me you love Natsuhiko too...?"]
 74:  688| [47] [Salyu]
 75:  691| [45] ["Mm. He's the one I love third most, after the professor and you."]
 76:  717| [47] [Mashiro]
 77:  720| [45] ["... I see."]
 78:  725| [47] [Alice]
 79:  728| [45] ["Kyuu."]
 80:  733| [45] [Alice cried a voice that signified "relief".]
 81:  738| [47] [Salyu]
 82:  741| [45] ["Mashiro, you felt relieved just now. Why?"]
 83:  767| [47] [Mashiro]
 84:  770| [45] ["Huh? Ah, no, I..."]
 85:  796| [47] [Mashiro]
 86:  799| [45] ["... Man, there's no getting past Alice's eyes, is there?"]
 87:  804| [47] [Salyu]
 88:  807| [45] ["?"]
 89:  833| [47] [Mashiro]
 90:  836| [45] ["Well... I know it's odd of me to say this... but despite appearances, I'm quite a jealous girl."]
 91:  841| [47] [Salyu]
 92:  844| [45] ["...?"]
 93:  870| [47] [Mashiro]
 94:  873| [45] ["I've already got an eternal rival. I almost thought I had yet another one to worry about...%Nso I panicked a little."]
 95:  878| [47] [Salyu]
 96:  881| [45] ["...??? I'm sorry, I don't follow."]
 97:  907| [47] [Mashiro]
 98:  910| [45] ["I guess it really is too early for you then, huh, Salyu?"]
 99:  915| [47] [Salyu]
100:  918| [45] ["... Looks like it."]
101:  923| [45] [That was the first time Salyu saw an inconsistency in Mashiro's behavior.]
102:  928| [47] [Salyu]
103:  931| [45] ["... Mashiro, sometimes even you seem to have your secrets."]
104:  957| [47] [Mashiro]
105:  960| [45] ["Well, people are piles of secrets."]
106:  986| [47] [Mashiro]
107:  989| [45] ["... But you know what, Salyu? That's what makes interacting with people fun."]
108:  994| [47] [Salyu]
109:  997| [45] ["The fun of figuring out secrets?"]
110: 1023| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1026| [45] ["I guess there's also some fun in learning how some secrets must never be found out."]
112: 1037| [45] [--After Mashiro said that, they heard footsteps from outside the room.]
113: 1042| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1045| [45] ["Mm... looks like Natsuhiko's back."]
115: 1071| [47] [Mashiro]
116: 1074| [45] ["Ah, crap. Let's pretend we're asleep."]
117: 1079| [47] [Salyu]
118: 1082| [45] ["Why?"]
119: 1108| [47] [Mashiro]
120: 1111| [45] ["Because it's embarrassing. So just go to sleep."]
121: 1116| [47] [Salyu]
122: 1119| [45] ["Mm."]
123: 1212| [45] [Salyu shut her eyes as told.]
124: 1217| [45] [Just this once, Mashiro's behavior was unintelligible from start to finish.]
125: 1286| [45] [Salyu thought to herself as she listened to Natsuhiko enter the room and sit on the sofa.]
126: 1291| [47] [Salyu]
127: 1292| [45] [(... Secrets that must never be found out... Looks like even Mashiro has some of her own.)]
128: 1297| [47] [Salyu]
129: 1298| [45] [(But if everyone has these unsolvable secrets...)]
130: 1303| [47] [Salyu]
131: 1304| [45] [(... that's actually a relief.)]
132: 1309| [47] [Salyu]
133: 1310| [45] [(Because it would mean I'm not alone. It would mean everyone else has similar worries...)]
134: 1316| [45] [And with that thought, she fell asleep once more.]
