  1:   86| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N　%N]
  2:   90| [47] [[--Memories with Ena Tsubakiyama--]]
  3:  170| [45] [--Watase turned himself over to the police after escaping LABO.]
  4:  175| [45] [Kazami and Jun tried to stop him, but he wouldn't hear a word of it.]
  5:  180| [45] [He figured nothing would change unless he was officially tried by the law...]
  6:  187| [45] [12 days passed since then.]
  7:  192| [45] [Watase, whose name was replaced with the designation "Number 0087", waited in his cell at a detention center for the day of his trial to arrive.]
  8:  197| [47] [Watase]
  9:  198| [45] [(... Damn, I'm bored.)]
 10:  203| [45] [Watase sighed in his single-man cell set aside for political prisoners.]
 11:  208| [45] [With no one to talk to, he had nothing to do until his trial date.]
 12:  213| [45] [He at least did some muscle training to kill the time, but it wasn't like he could do that all day long.]
 13:  218| [47] [Watase]
 14:  219| [45] [(Is it time for my trial yet...?)]
 15:  224| [45] [Just as he thought that, he heard the voice of the prison guard calling from outside.]
 16:  229| [47] [Prison Guard]
 17:  232| [45] ["--#87, you have a visitor."]
 18:  240| [47] [Watase]
 19:  243| [45] ["A visitor? For me?"]
 20:  248| [45] [It was probably Kazami, or perhaps Jun.]
 21:  253| [45] [At any rate, the security guard escorted Watase to the visitor's room.]
 22:  299| [45] [Waiting for him there was--]
 23:  383| [47] [Ena]
 24:  386| [45] ["It's been a while, Captain Kasasagi."]
 25:  394| [47] [Watase]
 26:  397| [45] ["Teach..."]
 27:  402| [45] [Now that was someone Watase hadn't expected to see.]
 28:  410| [47] [Watase]
 29:  413| [45] ["What's wrong? What'd you come all the way here for?"]
 30:  421| [47] [Ena]
 31:  424| [45] ["Now that's a cold greeting. I came here because I wanted to see you, and this is the thanks I get?"]
 32:  447| [47] [Watase]
 33:  450| [45] ["..."]
 34:  498| [47] [Ena]
 35:  501| [45] ["Sorry, that was a joke. The truth is that there's something I want to discuss with you."]
 36:  509| [47] [Watase]
 37:  512| [45] ["And what would that be?"]
 38:  520| [47] [Ena]
 39:  523| [45] ["I was wondering if you'd help us out with our investigation."]
 40:  603| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
 41:  607| [47] [--Ena then began to explain.]
 42:  615| [47] ["Your sentence will be greatly reduced in exchange for helping us wipe out Q".]
 43:  623| [47] [In short, that was her proposal...]
 44:  685| [47] [Ena]
 45:  688| [45] ["--Essentially, it's a kind of plea-bargaining."]
 46:  696| [47] [Ena]
 47:  699| [45] ["Japan has no plea-bargaining system, but you can achieve a similar result with the application of multiple trial-related systems."]
 48:  707| [47] [Watase]
 49:  710| [45] ["I see..."]
 50:  715| [45] [Watase pondered the matter once he'd heard Ena's side of the story.]
 51:  720| [45] [He had no guilt about "selling out his comrades".]
 52:  725| [45] [Now that he knew it was Q's indiscriminate acts of destruction that had sent everyone's lives off track, he too wished for the organization's elimination.]
 53:  773| [47] [Ena]
 54:  776| [45] ["Well? Doesn't sound bad, does it?"]
 55:  784| [47] [Watase]
 56:  787| [45] ["Yeah, you've got that right."]
 57:  795| [47] [Watase]
 58:  798| [45] ["But there's one thing that bothers me--"]
 59:  806| [47] [Watase]
 60:  809| [45] ["Why are you going so far for me?"]
 61:  857| [47] [Ena]
 62:  860| [45] ["Huh?"]
 63:  868| [47] [Watase]
 64:  871| [45] ["I'm pretty much a nobody in the overall organization. Your investigation would probably proceed just fine without my help."]
 65:  879| [47] [Watase]
 66:  882| [45] ["So why are you going out of your way to make a deal with me?"]
 67:  890| [47] [Ena]
 68:  893| [45] ["Good question... Well, there are several reasons."]
 69:  901| [47] [Ena]
 70:  904| [45] ["But I'd have to say it's because I wanted to do something with you again."]
 71:  912| [47] [Watase]
 72:  915| [45] ["Huh?"]
 73:  960| [45] [Ena smiled at Watase's confused response.]
 74: 1017| [47] [Ena]
 75: 1020| [45] ["I spent nine hours with you on that day."]
 76: 1075| [47] [Ena]
 77: 1078| [45] ["I had to run all around LABO, pursued by fire, smoke, and WX particles, all without a clue who I could trust..."]
 78: 1133| [47] [Ena]
 79: 1136| [45] ["I was so scared and in pain back then that I just wanted to run away. The loss of my colleagues left me lonely and discouraged."]
 80: 1144| [47] [Ena]
 81: 1147| [45] ["I never want to go through another experience like that ever again."]
 82: 1189| [47] [Ena]
 83: 1192| [45] ["And yet for some reason..."]
 84: 1200| [47] [Ena]
 85: 1203| [45] ["I remember the events of that day a little fondly."]
 86: 1208| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1209| [45] ["..."]
 88: 1257| [47] [Ena]
 89: 1260| [45] ["... Hey, you know what I think, Captain Kasasagi?"]
 90: 1268| [47] [Ena]
 91: 1271| [45] ["I believe it was thanks to you that I didn't end up running away in fear."]
 92: 1279| [47] [Ena]
 93: 1282| [45] ["You were powerless and had no memories, yet you worked your hardest for everyone else. Seeing you like that is what gave me the courage I needed..."]
 94: 1290| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1293| [45] ["... I see..."]
 96: 1340| [45] [He thought back to that day.]
 97: 1345| [45] [He didn't remember it fondly at all.]
 98: 1399| [45] [He lost two comrades, got innocent people hurt, and failed to save one of the girls he tried to rescue.]
 99: 1404| [45] [All of those were crosses he had to bear.]
100: 1443| [45] [But in spite of all that--]
101: 1448| [47] [Watase]
102: 1449| [45] [(There is one thing I remember fondly...)]
103: 1503| [45] [That "thing" was his amnesiac self.]
104: 1508| [45] [The other "Watase" who had vanished once he got his memories back.]
105: 1513| [45] [That man had been justice incarnate.]
106: 1565| [45] [A pure soul who only cared about saving everyone else, heedless of the risk that he could lose his own life in the process.]
107: 1570| [45] [He didn't hesitate for a moment, no matter what stood in his way.]
108: 1575| [45] [That man was probably gone forever.]
109: 1580| [45] [If that man had been a radiant light, then would that make the current Watase a dark shadow?]
110: 1619| [47] [Watase]
111: 1620| [45] [(... No.)]
112: 1625| [45] [Watase clenched his fists with that thought.]
113: 1630| [45] [He felt the flame in his chest that had sputtered out in the detention center roar to life once again.]
114: 1666| [47] [Ena]
115: 1669| [45] ["... We're going to start a fight against the 'malice' that lurks in society."]
116: 1677| [47] [Ena]
117: 1680| [45] ["Q isn't our only enemy. We're planning to expose the Rokumei City government, LABO, and all manner of BC-related criminal activity."]
118: 1688| [47] [Ena]
119: 1691| [45] ["It'll probably be another rough and arduous battle."]
120: 1699| [47] [Ena]
121: 1702| [45] ["But if we have you with us... then I have a feeling we'll be able to pull through and emerge as the victors in the end."]
122: 1750| [47] [Ena]
123: 1753| [45] ["Or maybe I'm just weak?"]
124: 1758| [45] [Ena said that with a self-deprecating laugh.]
125: 1763| [45] [But Watase answered clearly.]
126: 1771| [47] [Watase]
127: 1774| [45] ["No, you're strong."]
128: 1782| [47] [Watase]
129: 1785| [45] ["Believe me, you're far stronger than the likes of me."]
130: 1847| [47] [Ena]
131: 1850| [45] ["..."]
132: 1855| [45] [A faint tinge of red covered Ena's cheeks.]
133: 1860| [45] [She looked away and muttered something in a tiny voice.]
134: 1908| [47] [Ena]
135: 1911| [45] ["... Could the suspension bridge effect still be going on?"]
136: 1919| [47] [Watase]
137: 1922| [45] ["Hmm? You say something?"]
138: 1970| [47] [Ena]
139: 1973| [45] ["Ah, no, nothing."]
140: 1978| [45] [Ena quickly glossed over what she'd been mumbling and looked Watase in the eye.]
141: 1986| [47] [Ena]
142: 1989| [45] ["... Then let me hear your answer one more time."]
143: 1997| [47] [Ena]
144: 2000| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, will you lend us your strength in our fight?"]
145: 2008| [47] [Watase]
146: 2011| [45] ["Of course."]
147: 2016| [45] [Watase nodded and answered reassuringly.]
148: 2024| [47] [Watase]
149: 2027| [45] ["Time to go out to the battlefield once again. Together this time."]
150: 2072| [45] [Ena smiled happily when she heard that.]
151: 2077| [45] [Much like the smile of any normal girl--]
