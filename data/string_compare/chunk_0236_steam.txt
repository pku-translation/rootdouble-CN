  1:   86| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Mashiro with wide eyes.]
  2:   91| [45] [There was blood on her right shoulder--!]
  3:  118| [47] [Mashiro]
  4:  121| [45] ["Huh!? What... is this...!?"]
  5:  126| [45] [A red stain grew on Mashiro's clothes before their eyes.]
  6:  131| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  132| [45] [(Mashiro... was shot!?)]
  8:  137| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  138| [45] [(By who!? From where!?)]
 10:  165| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  168| [45] ["Agh, no... it burns, it hurts... Natsuhiko...!"]
 12:  176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  179| [45] ["Are you okay, Mashiro!? I'll treat it right--"]
 14:  184| [45] [But right as Natsuhiko started to yell--]
 15:  192| [47] [???]
 16:  195| [45] ["... Guess it's harder to hit a moving target than you'd think."]
 17:  200| [45] [--he heard a low voice from behind him.]
 18:  208| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  211| [45] ["!?"]
 20:  421| [45] [He turned around, and there by the open gate was a man with a gun.]
 21:  429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  432| [45] ["Y... you!?"]
 23:  437| [45] [The man was wearing a rescue squad outfit.]
 24:  442| [45] [A man whose mission was supposedly to save lives was now giving Natsuhiko a look that could kill.]
 25:  450| [47] [Man]
 26:  453| [45] ["We meet again, Communicator."]
 27:  461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  464| [45] ["...!?"]
 29:  525| [45] [The man's voice sounded familiar-- It was a voice they heard last night at the ruined factory.]
 30:  530| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  531| [45] [(He's that terrorist!?)]
 32:  536| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  537| [45] [(Did he chase after us!?)]
 34:  597| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko made the connection, the man fired another shot.]
 35:  670| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  673| [45] ["!!"]
 37:  678| [45] [A sharp sound whizzed through the air right beside Natsuhiko's ear.]
 38:  683| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  684| [45] [(He's trying to kill us! --If we stay here, Mashiro's gonna...!)]
 40:  738| [45] [Natsuhiko fled from the man, Mashiro in his arms.]
 41:  845| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  848| [45] ["Agh... uugh...!"]
 43:  853| [45] [Mashiro cried out in pain due to her wound.]
 44:  861| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  864| [45] ["Hang in there, Mashiro!"]
 46:  869| [45] [As he tried to voice his encouragement, Natsuhiko thought to himself.]
 47:  874| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  875| [45] [(Salyu said she was shot too...!)]
 49:  880| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  881| [45] [(Was he the one that shot her!?)]
 51:  886| [45] [Salyu said she knocked out the two terrorists.]
 52:  891| [45] [But they saw three terrorists in the ruined factory.]
 53:  896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  897| [45] [(Then this man was the last one--!)]
 55:  926| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  929| [45] ["!!"]
 57:  934| [45] [Just then, another gunshot rang out from behind them.]
 58:  939| [45] [--If they didn't escape, they'd be killed.]
 59:  944| [45] [Natsuhiko frantically turned the corner.]
 60: 1011| [45] [There was a security gate on the other side.]
 61: 1022| [45] [With Mashiro still in his arms, he swiped the card through the slot.]
 62: 1027| [45] [As the gate slowly opened, he heard footsteps coming from behind.]
 63: 1032| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1033| [45] [(Hurry up! Hurry up! Open, dammit!)]
 65: 1038| [45] [But as Natsuhiko pleaded,]
 66: 1113| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1116| [45] ["Guh!!"]
 68: 1121| [45] [he was suddenly interrupted by an intense pain.]
 69: 1126| [45] [He could feel warm blood oozing out from his side.]
 70: 1131| [45] [A bullet had apparently gouged out just a tiny bit of his flesh.]
 71: 1159| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1162| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko, a... a bullet just...!"]
 73: 1170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 1173| [45] ["--It's just a scratch!"]
 75: 1246| [45] [At least that's what he told himself as he dashed to the other side of the gate.]
 76: 1346| [45] [As they got to the other side, Natsuhiko pressed the open/close button on the security gate panel to shut the gate.]
 77: 1351| [45] [But it probably wouldn't buy them much more than a few seconds.]
 78: 1356| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1357| [45] [(He probably has a security card too...!)]
 80: 1362| [45] [Natsuhiko rushed for the emergency staircase with Mashiro in his arms.]
 81: 1411| [45] [But the staircase was already destroyed.]
 82: 1419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1422| [45] ["Dammit!!"]
 84: 1427| [45] [Natsuhiko called the map to mind and searched for escape routes.]
 85: 1432| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1433| [45] [(We're currently at Floor B2 of Area 6's inner ring)]
 87: 1438| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1439| [45] [(Nine years ago, we escaped through the cargo lift.)]
 89: 1444| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1445| [45] [(That was probably in the outer ring--!)]
 91: 1495| [45] [When his thoughts had gotten that far, he heard sounds from outside the stairwell.]
 92: 1503| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1506| [45] ["!!"]
 94: 1511| [45] [It was the sound of the man opening the closed gate.]
 95: 1516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 1517| [45] [(Crap, he's gonna corner us...!)]
 97: 1522| [45] [If they left the stairwell, the enemy would surely shoot them.]
 98: 1527| [45] [But it was impossible for them to climb up to the surface with the staircase collapsed.]
 99: 1553| [47] [Mashiro]
100: 1556| [45] ["..."]
101: 1561| [45] [Mashiro grabbed Natsuhiko's arm. Her hand was trembling.]
102: 1572| [45] [The footsteps approached. There was no time.]
103: 1577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1578| [45] [(If we only had a moment of an opening to get to the outer ring--!)]
105: 1583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1584| [45] [(Is there anything we can do!? Anything to divert his attention!?)]
107: 1657| [45] [Natsuhiko thought for a second before an idea struck him.]
108: 1662| [45] [He focused hard and searched for the approaching man's characteristic brain waveform.]
109: 1667| [45] [The man was Type 5, a lone wolf detached from reality.]
110: 1672| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1673| [45] [(Take this...!)]
112: 1678| [45] [Natsuhiko focused with all his might, sending forth intense telepathy.]
113: 1739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1742| [45] [{STOP!!!!!}]
115: 1750| [47] [Man]
116: 1753| [45] ["Ghh!?"]
117: 1758| [45] [They heard the man scream from outside the stairwell.]
118: 1809| [45] [Natsuhiko held Mashiro and ran out of the stairwell.]
119: 1814| [45] [The man was standing still with his hands against his ears just outside in the connecting passageway.]
120: 1819| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1820| [45] [(That was my most intense telepathy yet! Can your brain withstand such a loud sound!?)]
122: 1825| [45] [Natsuhiko concentrated further and fired off even more telepathy.]
123: 1830| [45] [The power necessary for a range of over 2 km, all at point-blank range!]
124: 1895| [47] [Natsuhiko]
125: 1898| [45] [{Don't move!!!}]
126: 1963| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1966| [45] [{I'll wreck your brain!!!!}]
128: 2031| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 2034| [45] [{Wreck it wreck it wreck it wreck it!!!!!}]
130: 2042| [47] [Man]
131: 2045| [45] ["...!"]
132: 2050| [45] [The man fell to his knees in pain.]
133: 2055| [45] [It worked! Or at least he thought--]
134: 2063| [47] [Man]
135: 2066| [45] ["Ugh... aaaggghhh!!"]
136: 2071| [45] [The man shot his gun without getting up.]
137: 2132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 2135| [45] ["!!"]
139: 2215| [45] [Natsuhiko shielded Mashiro in his arms.]
140: 2220| [45] [Luckily, the bullet did not hit them.]
141: 2225| [45] [But the man kept shooting recklessly.]
142: 2279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 2280| [45] [(Shit!)]
144: 2328| [45] [Natsuhiko ran without rest.]
145: 2333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2334| [45] [(Dammit, telepathy isn't going to cut it! Even if it causes him to falter, it won't take him down!)]
147: 2339| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko rushed into the connecting passageway to the outer ring.]
148: 2400| [45] [A gunshot rang out from behind them.]
149: 2405| [45] [Mashiro breathed painfully.]
150: 2467| [47] [Mashiro]
151: 2470| [45] ["Haah, haah..."]
152: 2475| [45] [Her eyes looked vacant, as if she were running a fever.]
153: 2483| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2486| [45] ["Mashiro, are you okay!?"]
155: 2512| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 2515| [45] ["Mm... mm..."]
157: 2520| [45] [Her answer was weak and ambiguous.]
158: 2525| [45] [Perhaps the sudden loss of blood was putting her into shock.]
159: 2530| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 2531| [45] [(If we don't escape quickly, Mashiro's gonna...!)]
161: 2536| [45] [--But escape alone was not enough.]
162: 2541| [45] [The terrorists' goal was to destroy the city.]
163: 2546| [45] [They were probably going to cause a meltdown right after this.]
164: 2551| [45] [Even if they got Mashiro out of there. Even if Salyu had already escaped.]
165: 2556| [45] [If the atomic dust scattered everywhere, then everyone would die before they could escape to a sufficient distance.]
166: 2561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2562| [45] [(... In that case...)]
168: 2567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2568| [45] [(What I need to do for the girls is--!)]
170: 2573| [45] [Intense determination filled Natsuhiko's heart.]
171: 2578| [45] [And then he slipped through the connecting passageway and approached Area 6's outer ring.]
