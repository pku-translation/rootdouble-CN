  1:   18| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   19| [45] [(Crap...!)]
  3:   24| [45] [The professor briskly walked towards them as Natsuhiko silently cursed this unexpected turn of events.]
  4:   32| [47] [Miyoko]
  5:   35| [45] ["I got a call from the security department last night. They say you injured a security guard at the PRC?"]
  6:   43| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:   46| [45] ["Oh, I see how it is... So you came back just for that?"]
  8:   72| [47] [Miyoko]
  9:   75| [45] ["Of course I did! Never in my dreams did I expect my own son would do something like that!"]
 10:  101| [47] [Miyoko]
 11:  104| [45] ["Yui, you were with him. What were you thinking!?"]
 12:  137| [47] [Salyu]
 13:  140| [45] ["... I-I'm sorry."]
 14:  166| [47] [Miyoko]
 15:  169| [45] ["You too, Mashiro! They said you were with them too!?"]
 16:  202| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  205| [45] ["I-I'm sorry, but..."]
 18:  210| [45] [Natsuhiko glared back at the professor as she scolded them.]
 19:  218| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  221| [45] ["Hold on a second, Mom. They have nothing to do with this, do they!?"]
 21:  229| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  232| [45] ["No, in fact YOU don't have anything to do with this, Mom. This is our probl--"]
 23:  258| [47] [Miyoko]
 24:  261| [45] ["I don't have anything to do with this!? Of course I do! I had to be dragged out of my busy work schedule..."]
 25:  266| [45] [The professor sighed deeply.]
 26:  292| [47] [Miyoko]
 27:  295| [45] ["... Please, just don't add to my problems needlessly. I'm busier than I've ever been with my current work."]
 28:  303| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  306| [45] ["...!"]
 30:  311| [45] [Something snapped inside Natsuhiko.]
 31:  316| [45] [The professor's son and his friends were being pursued on the pretext of a false charge and yet she wouldn't listen to any of it.]
 32:  321| [45] [And to top it all off, she was still trying to focus on work.]
 33:  329| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  332| [45] ["... Okay, Mom. Sorry for being a pest. Just go back to LABO and work already."]
 35:  358| [47] [Miyoko]
 36:  361| [45] ["How can you expect me to just do that?"]
 37:  369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  372| [45] ["How? It's easy. You keep talking about work this and work that. If work's so important to you, then just go already."]
 39:  377| [45] [He felt something murmuring in his heart as he spoke.]
 40:  382| [45] [He knew he sounded like a spoiled child, but he couldn't stop the words from leaving his lips.]
 41:  390| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  393| [45] ["They're pursuing us based on a false charge."]
 43:  401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  404| [45] ["We were partly at fault, but that security guard lied in his report."]
 45:  430| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  433| [45] ["Huh?"]
 47:  441| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  444| [45] ["And we're not even doing anything wrong. We're just searching for the terrorists in town."]
 49:  470| [47] [Miyoko]
 50:  473| [45] ["Terrorists...? What are you talking about!?"]
 51:  481| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  484| [45] ["There's a very likely possibility they're here. So we're doing what we can to stop them--"]
 53:  510| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  513| [45] ["You kids? Stop terrorists!? Don't be foolish!"]
 55:  518| [45] [The professor raised her voice sharply.]
 56:  526| [47] [Miyoko]
 57:  529| [45] ["Listen to me! Stop spouting nonsense and just stay inside like I'm telling you to!"]
 58:  537| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  540| [45] ["No, this is my own decision! I can't just back down and listen to you!"]
 60:  548| [47] [Miyoko]
 61:  551| [45] ["Is there something I'm not giving you enough of!? I've provided you with a carefree life, haven't I!?"]
 62:  559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  562| [45] ["Well yeah, you have been providing for us financially, but that doesn't give you the right to criticize every action I take!"]
 64:  570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  573| [45] ["How do you expect me to listen to everything you say when you're never around to say it!?"]
 66:  599| [47] [Miyoko]
 67:  602| [45] ["!"]
 68:  607| [45] [The professor's face froze over at those words.]
 69:  633| [47] [Mashiro]
 70:  636| [45] ["N-Natsuhiko, stop it!"]
 71:  662| [47] [Salyu]
 72:  665| [45] ["You've said too much..."]
 73:  670| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu frantically cut in.]
 74:  675| [45] [But that was something Natsuhiko had always wanted to tell his mother.]
 75:  680| [45] [He couldn't stop the words he had been holding back all this time.]
 76:  688| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77:  691| [45] ["You took custody of Yuuri after her parents died, right? I thought that was very noble of you."]
 78:  699| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79:  702| [45] ["But can you look me in the eye and say you've become a new mother for her?"]
 80:  728| [47] [Miyoko]
 81:  731| [45] ["...!"]
 82:  739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83:  742| [45] ["I know it's too late for me to say this now, but you've always been too preoccupied with work to even care about what happened at home, haven't you?"]
 84:  768| [47] [Miyoko]
 85:  771| [45] ["That's..."]
 86:  779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87:  782| [45] ["Do you realize how lonely Yuuri and I were, growing up in a house without parents to welcome home at night?"]
 88:  790| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89:  793| [45] ["Do you know what it felt like, watching over Yuuri as she struggled with her emotional trauma!?"]
 90:  798| [47] [Miyoko]
 91:  799| [45] ["..."]
 92:  807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93:  810| [45] ["Of course, Yuuri's completely innocent here."]
 94:  818| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 95:  821| [45] ["I'm grateful for how you managed to support the family as a single mother. I truly am."]
 96:  829| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97:  832| [45] ["That's why I never said anything. But this. This is the last--"]
 98:  946| [45] [Just then, a weak "smack" rang out against Natsuhiko's cheek.]
 99:  954| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100:  957| [45] ["!?"]
101:  962| [45] [It was the frail slap of his mother's palm against his cheek.]
102:  970| [47] [Natsuhiko]
103:  973| [45] ["... You hit me. That's a first. Guess you had to start acting like a parent somewhere... huh!?"]
104:  978| [45] [Natsuhiko made it that far before gasping.]
105: 1016| [45] [For he saw tears welling up in the professor's eyes.]
106: 1024| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 1027| [45] ["... It was all for you..."]
108: 1035| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1038| [45] ["... I'm trying my hardest just for you...!"]
110: 1046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1049| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
112: 1075| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1078| [45] ["Natsuhiko, you made the professor cry. How cruel."]
114: 1104| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 1107| [45] ["Ah, you should apologize..."]
116: 1112| [45] [Bitter regret filled his heart as the girls admonished him.]
117: 1117| [45] [But what felt stronger than his regret was his confusion.]
118: 1122| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1123| [45] [(It was all for ME!?)]
120: 1128| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1129| [45] [(I never asked for this!)]
122: 1134| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1135| [45] [(So why... Why are you crying!? What's with that timing!?)]
124: 1140| [45] [He couldn't understand his mother's feelings.]
125: 1145| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa continued in a low voice.]
126: 1171| [47] [Miyoko]
127: 1174| [45] ["Natsuhiko, I'm begging you, please listen to me for now..."]
128: 1182| [47] [Miyoko]
129: 1185| [45] ["I need to go back to LABO right away... but we can talk as much as we want afterwards."]
130: 1193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 1196| [45] ["For now...?"]
132: 1204| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1207| [45] ["What do you mean, Mom? Is there something you want to tell me!?"]
134: 1233| [47] [Miyoko]
135: 1236| [45] ["... No."]
136: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1247| [45] ["Does it have anything to do with what's going on now!?"]
138: 1255| [47] [Miyoko]
139: 1258| [45] ["Not at all. Though I do think one day the time will come when we can talk about it..."]
140: 1263| [45] [The professor spoke insinuative words.]
141: 1268| [45] [Natsuhiko wanted to know what was on her mind.]
142: 1273| [45] [He wanted to know from the bottom of his heart, for the very first time.]
143: 1278| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 1279| [45] [(Mom... what are you trying to say!?)]
145: 1285| [45] [As that thought crossed his mind--]
146: 1394| [45] [His five senses suddenly faded into the distance.]
147: 1399| [45] [His vision blurred. His hearing diminished.]
148: 1410| [45] [And instead--]
149: 1415| [45] [Voices echoed in Natsuhiko's "brain".]
150: 1608| [85] [{I knew it. He hates me...}]
151: 1609| [86] [Miyoko]
152: 1610| [86] [{I knew it. He hates me...}]
153: 1625| [85] [{But until all the work is complete, it'd be best if I avoided him...}]
154: 1626| [86] [Miyoko]
155: 1627| [86] [{But until all the work is complete, it'd be best if I avoided him...}]
156: 1658| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 1661| [45] ["!!"]
158: 1666| [45] [Natsuhiko was shocked.]
159: 1671| [45] [The sensation was quite similar to receiving telepathy.]
160: 1676| [45] [But not entirely. He heard a voice directly echoing in his head, but-- ]
161: 1681| [45] [Natsuhiko had heard Dr. Tenkawa's mental voice!]
162: 1686| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 1687| [45] [(This is empathy!?)]
164: 1849| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko had that thought, his five senses returned.]
165: 1894| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 1897| [45] ["--Natsuhiko!"]
167: 1902| [45] [He snapped back when he heard Mashiro's voice up against his ear.]
168: 1910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 1913| [45] ["!!? Wh-what happened!?"]
170: 1927| [47] [Mashiro]
171: 1930| [45] ["Someone's coming this way!"]
172: 1938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
173: 1941| [45] ["!"]
174: 2043| [45] [He turned around in shock to see two men running their direction from the other side of the street.]
175: 2048| [45] [They were the security department members who were standing in front of Mashiro's house yesterday.]
176: 2053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2054| [45] [(Dammit, did they see us already!?)]
178: 2059| [45] [He was concerned about the meaning of his mother's tears and if he had just used empathy. But--]
179: 2100| [47] [Natsuhiko]
180: 2103| [45] ["--Let's get out of here!"]
181: 2108| [45] [--Natsuhiko quickly shouted that command.]
182: 2180| [45] [And with just a moment of hesitation, Mashiro and Salyu nodded.]
183: 2206| [47] [Mashiro]
184: 2209| [45] ["I'm sorry, Professor! We have to go now!"]
185: 2235| [47] [Salyu]
186: 2238| [45] ["Professor, I'll protect Natsuhiko! No need for concern!"]
187: 2292| [45] [And with that, the three of them ran away.]
188: 2297| [45] [Leaving behind Dr. Tenkawa, hanging her head in shame...]
