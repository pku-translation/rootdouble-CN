  0:   53| [45] [--Natsuhiko plunged into that memory billowing with malice yet again.]
  1:  104| [45] [It had taken place only a few hours ago.]
  2:  109| [45] [Natsuhiko and Watase had been facing off.]
  3:  206| [45] [--Watase grabbed the "Communicator" by the nape of his neck and snarled.]
  4:  214| [47] [Watase]
  5:  217| [45] ["Look, you Communicator... Even if you don't know it, I've got a perfectly good reason to hate your kind."]
  6:  225| [47] [Watase]
  7:  228| [45] ["You have precious friends, right? Well there was someone who was more precious to me than anyone else."]
  8:  254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  257| [45] ["Wh... what are you... talking about...!?"]
 10:  262| [45] [Watase felt like he could cry when he heard the Communicator ask that with clear bewilderment.]
 11:  267| [45] [The monster who had taken Wataru's life didn't even know who she was.]
 12:  275| [47] [Watase]
 13:  278| [45] ["You don't know? Nah, of course you don't. What's one more dead kid in a list of 118 casualties?"]
 14:  286| [47] [Watase]
 15:  289| [45] ["But that kid was my other half. My very mirror image."]
 16:  297| [47] [Watase]
 17:  300| [45] ["Weak, but motivated. Stupid, but gentle. The very embodiment of light to me."]
 18:  308| [47] [Watase]
 19:  311| [45] ["But that light died. And all that's left is a dark shadow."]
 20:  319| [47] [Watase]
 21:  322| [45] ["... That's me. That's Watase Kasasagi."]
 22:  330| [47] [Watase]
 23:  333| [45] ["Burn that name into your ears. Carve it into your mind. Reflect on that name until the moment you die!!"]
 24:  338| [45] [Watase's heartbroken screams echoed through the cramped room.]
 25:  360| [45] [--It was almost unbearable for Natsuhiko to watch this memory.]
 26:  365| [45] [There was no trace of any alteration to this memory.]
 27:  370| [45] [This was reality. Those were the exact words Watase had said to Natsuhiko.]
 28:  375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  376| [45] [(I can't repair this memory... Even if I do, it won't help...)]
 30:  381| [45] [Natsuhiko endured the pain in his heart and continued watching.]
 31:  494| [47] [Watase]
 32:  497| [45] ["--Don't think I'll just -give- you the repose of death."]
 33:  505| [47] [Watase]
 34:  508| [45] ["That's it. Run, run, run, you damn Communicator."]
 35:  516| [47] [Watase]
 36:  519| [45] ["Just like how we ran in the hospital that night."]
 37:  524| [45] [Watase spat those words out as he watched the Communicator run away from him.]
 38:  532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  535| [45] ["... Dammit...!"]
 40:  543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  546| [45] ["Dammit, dammit, dammit...!"]
 42:  551| [45] [The Communicator cursed over and over again as he ran for his life.]
 43:  556| [45] [Watase chased him as he felt a sick, twisted joy.]
 44:  561| [45] [At last, he could finally kill the monster responsible for Wataru's death... the abomination he despised so much--]
 45:  655| [45] [The Communicator dashed out of Area 1 and ran towards Area N.]
 46:  660| [45] [A thought ran through Watase's head as he gripped his gun tightly.]
 47:  665| [47] [Watase]
 48:  666| [45] [(--Hey, Wataru, would you be sad if you ever saw me like this?)]
 49:  671| [47] [Watase]
 50:  672| [45] [(Hey, Kazami, would you be sad if you knew a rescue captain like me was trying to kill someone?)]
 51:  677| [47] [Watase]
 52:  678| [45] [(But you know, I want the two of you to think about it carefully.)]
 53:  683| [47] [Watase]
 54:  684| [45] [(Communicators aren't humans. They're mind-corrupting monsters.)]
 55:  689| [47] [Watase]
 56:  690| [45] [(This is a monster hunt...! Kill or be killed...!)]
 57:  695| [47] [Watase]
 58:  696| [45] [(Another 118 innocents will die if I don't kill that monster right here and now!)]
 59:  701| [47] [Watase]
 60:  702| [45] [(I will give life to 118 people for the 118 that died, including Wataru.)]
 61:  707| [47] [Watase]
 62:  708| [45] [(So the two of you will forgive me, right?)]
 63:  713| [47] [Watase]
 64:  714| [45] [(I have to kill that monster in accordance with my beliefs.)]
 65:  719| [47] [Watase]
 66:  720| [45] [(I have to convince myself of this... I have to be strong...!)]
 67:  725| [47] [Watase]
 68:  726| [45] [(Time to kill... I must kill the monster.)]
 69:  731| [47] [Watase]
 70:  732| [45] [(Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...)]
 71:  755| [45] [--Tremendous malice filled his heart.]
 72:  760| [45] [An incoherent, unstable malice perched precariously on the brink of madness.]
 73:  765| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74:  766| [45] [(To think Watase could be driven to this state...)]
 75:  771| [45] [Boundless sorrow filled Natsuhiko's heart.]
 76:  776| [45] [This was the first time he had felt such sorrow ever since his and Watase's minds had become one.]
 77:  781| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 78:  782| [45] [(... I swear... I'll erase this memory...)]
 79:  787| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  788| [45] [(This memory can't be allowed to exist... This isn't how Watase is supposed to be.)]
 81:  793| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82:  794| [45] [(If I can just erase it, then Watase should go back to his true self...!)]
 83:  812| [45] [--As soon as Natsuhiko had that thought--]
 84:  817| [45] [Watase chased Natsuhiko all the way into Area N.]
 85:  896| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86:  897| [45] [(... Huh...?)]
 87:  902| [45] [But Natsuhiko was overcome with surprise when he saw that memory.]
 88:  908| [45] [For there was no one in Area N.]
 89:  913| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90:  914| [45] [(Huh... huh? Hold on, what's going on here?)]
 91:  919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  920| [45] [(Why am I not in Area N?)]
 93:  978| [45] [The fact was that he'd fought Watase in Area N at this point, then erased his memories. That's how it was supposed to be.]
 94:  983| [45] [Yet Natsuhiko was nowhere to be found.]
 95:  998| [45] [Watase was standing all alone in Area N.]
 96: 1003| [45] [As if he were dumbfounded that the monster he was supposed to be killing wasn't there.]
 97: 1008| [45] [But filling the air of that empty void--]
 98: 1013| [45] [Was a floral scent.]
 99: 1021| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1024| [45] ["Wh... what's going on!?"]
101: 1032| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1035| [45] ["This wasn't how things happened!!"]
103: 1040| [45] [But just as Natsuhiko shouted that,]
104: 1050| [47] [???]
105: 1053| [45] ["Well, no shit."]
106: 1058| [45] [a voice echoed in his head.]
107: 1081| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1084| [45] ["!!"]
109: 1089| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
110: 1094| [45] [When he came to his senses-- he realized something was there that wasn't there a second ago--]
111: 1138| [45] [--A girl standing in the middle of the room that had been empty mere moments ago.]
112: 1143| [45] [She was the Communicator who'd been confined in Area Zero--]
113: 1151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1154| [45] ["Subject N...!?"]
115: 1159| [45] [Natsuhiko shuddered.]
116: 1164| [45] [He had a bad feeling that something terrifying was happening.]
117: 1190| [47] [Subject N]
118: 1193| [45] ["Man, looks like you've got no clue what the hell's going on, huh?"]
119: 1198| [45] [Subject N looked at Watase and said that.]
120: 1203| [45] [No-- perhaps she was looking at Natsuhiko and talking to him directly.]
121: 1208| [45] [The girl was speaking in a rough tone that didn't suit her at all.]
122: 1213| [45] [Furthermore, the look in her eyes was sharp and somewhat ominous.]
123: 1221| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1224| [45] ["Wha... what's going on here?"]
125: 1232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1235| [45] ["Hey, what the hell did you do!?"]
127: 1261| [47] [Subject N]
128: 1264| [45] ["This is all that remains of the BC energy that I-- that Subject N used."]
129: 1272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
130: 1275| [45] ["What...?"]
131: 1301| [47] [Subject N]
132: 1304| [45] ["When I used Senses Sympathy on Watase, I lobbed a powerful lump of information energy into that skull of his."]
133: 1312| [47] [Subject N]
134: 1315| [45] ["That lump has continued to stay in the depths of his dumbass brain without vanishing or decaying, despite the fact that it's been cut off from Senses Sympathy."]
135: 1323| [47] [Subject N]
136: 1326| [45] ["You could call that collection of energy... a spirit, so to speak."]
137: 1352| [47] [Subject N]
138: 1355| [45] ["That's me. I've been waiting in the depths of Watase's mind for you to haul your ass over here."]
139: 1378| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1381| [45] ["...!"]
141: 1386| [45] [A sense of shock and understanding hit Natsuhiko at the same time.]
142: 1391| [45] [Subject N continued to exist on the flip side of Watase's mind as a lump of information energy filled with malice, like a split personality.]
143: 1396| [45] [So even if what he were seeing wasn't reality, it wasn't Watase's memory either.]
144: 1401| [45] [It was a "visualization" of Watase's mind, so to speak.]
145: 1406| [45] [Natsuhiko was now facing off with Subject N's spirit which existed in the depths of that mind.]
146: 1414| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1417| [45] ["You're the source of Watase's desire to kill, aren't you...!?"]
148: 1443| [47] [Subject N]
149: 1446| [45] ["Yeah, bingo."]
150: 1454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 1457| [45] ["You... what do you get out of egging Watase on like that?"]
152: 1462| [45] [Natsuhiko held back his fear and interrogated Subject N.]
153: 1470| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 1473| [45] ["Aren't you a Communicator too? Didn't you ever consider that your actions could've caused your own death, too?"]
155: 1499| [47] [Subject N]
156: 1502| [45] ["Maybe I did. But who the hell cares?"]
157: 1510| [47] [Natsuhiko]
158: 1513| [45] ["What...!?"]
159: 1521| [47] [Subject N]
160: 1524| [45] ["Subject N has no 'self'. She can't fear her own death either."]
161: 1532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
162: 1535| [45] ["...!?"]
163: 1543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 1546| [45] ["What do you mean... you have no self...?"]
165: 1569| [45] [A smile formed on the girl's face when she heard that question.]
166: 1595| [47] [Subject N]
167: 1598| [45] ["... I was forced to participate in a certain experiment over the course of the many years I lived in this facility."]
168: 1606| [47] [Subject N]
169: 1609| [45] ["The experiment was to see how many people's minds I could dive into and copy their memories into my brain."]
170: 1635| [47] [Subject N]
171: 1638| [45] ["You know how many people that turned out to be? 351."]
172: 1646| [47] [Subject N]
173: 1649| [45] ["That many sets of memories overlapped with my own mind."]
174: 1657| [47] [Subject N]
175: 1660| [45] ["... Back when the whole experiment started, neither me nor those LABO bastards knew just how dangerous that was."]
176: 1668| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 1671| [45] ["Dangerous... how?"]
178: 1697| [47] [Subject N]
179: 1700| [45] ["Guess you're still clueless about it, but the thing about Senses Sympathy, you see--"]
180: 1708| [47] [Subject N]
181: 1711| [45] ["It isn't merely borrowing someone else's senses and seeing their memories."]
182: 1719| [47] [Subject N]
183: 1722| [45] ["It's using BC particles as an intermediary to copy the information in your target's brain into your own head."]
184: 1730| [47] [Subject N]
185: 1733| [45] ["It truly is the ability that connects people's minds. The power to share each other's feelings and sensations and have a mutual influence on each other."]
186: 1759| [47] [Subject N]
187: 1762| [45] ["By using this ability, the minds of the Communicator and their target blend inextricably together."]
188: 1788| [47] [Subject N]
189: 1791| [45] ["Let's take you for example. You hated Watase Kasasagi's guts, yet now you find yourself relating to him, right?"]
190: 1799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 1802| [45] ["Ah...!"]
192: 1828| [47] [Subject N]
193: 1831| [45] ["So basically, the more a Communicator uses Senses Sympathy, the more their mind mingles with their target's mind."]
194: 1839| [47] [Subject N]
195: 1842| [45] ["... Care to guess what happened to me after I did that shit 351 times?"]
196: 1868| [47] [Subject N]
197: 1871| [45] ["My sense of self went down the damn drain."]
198: 1894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
199: 1897| [45] ["!!"]
200: 1923| [47] [Subject N]
201: 1926| [45] ["Well, it ain't surprising. Melding with 351 different minds is the kind of shit no mortal mind can endure."]
202: 1934| [47] [Subject N]
203: 1937| [45] ["This is the fatal danger of Senses Sympathy. The more you use it, the more you wear your sense of self thin."]
204: 1963| [47] [Subject N]
205: 1966| [45] ["In exchange for my self, I obtained the memories of 351 different targets, plus my own.%NA grand total of 352 sets of memories."]
206: 1992| [47] [Subject N]
207: 1995| [45] ["One of them is mine. Beat the hell outta me which memories belong to that set, though."]
208: 2003| [47] [Subject N]
209: 2006| [45] ["So since I don't know what my real memories are, I can't obtain a real sense of self."]
210: 2032| [47] [Subject N]
211: 2035| [45] ["The one thing I do remember is the designation 'Subject N'."]
212: 2043| [47] [Subject N]
213: 2046| [45] ["I don't even remember how the hell I used to talk. The reason I'm running my mouth like a guy right now is probably Watase Kasasagi's influence at work."]
214: 2072| [47] [Subject N]
215: 2075| [45] ["So long story short, I lost my original self by melding with others' minds. I'm an extremely vague entity."]
216: 2083| [47] [Natsuhiko]
217: 2086| [45] ["..."]
218: 2091| [45] [Natsuhiko was utterly speechless. Seeing this, Subject N continued her dispassionate explanation.]
219: 2117| [47] [Subject N]
220: 2120| [45] ["The researchers apparently call my condition 'N-ification'."]
221: 2146| [47] [Subject N]
222: 2149| [45] ["Hahah. I don't remember a damn thing about myself, yet I remember totally pointless crap like that."]
223: 2157| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 2160| [45] ["N-ification...? What's the N stand for?"]
225: 2186| [47] [Subject N]
226: 2189| [45] ["Hell if I know. Maybe 'Nobody' or 'Neighbor'... or perhaps 'Nucleus'?"]
227: 2197| [47] [Subject N]
228: 2200| [45] ["A being who is 'nobody', yet 'neighbors' their target, and bases the 'nucleus' of their personality off of them. Therefore, I am Subject 'N'... Sure, whatever."]
229: 2205| [45] [The girl snorted, then continued.]
230: 2231| [47] [Subject N]
231: 2234| [45] ["Well, my name doesn't mean a damn. It's those piece of shit researchers who gave it to me anyway."]
232: 2242| [47] [Subject N]
233: 2245| [45] ["I've been N-ified for so damn long that I don't even remember when it happened."]
234: 2302| [47] [Subject N]
235: 2305| [45] ["All I really remember is that I was hanging from the ceiling of that room in Area Zero like a bagworm moth."]
236: 2313| [47] [Subject N]
237: 2316| [45] ["My head was empty that whooooole time, and I always dreamed. I barely thought about anything."]
238: 2324| [47] [Subject N]
239: 2327| [45] ["... And yet I just wanted to connect to others' minds like it was some kind of instinct. A lone desire that motivates me."]
240: 2360| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 2363| [45] ["I-I know...! I know fully well what you are!"]
242: 2371| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 2374| [45] ["B-but why did you become malice incarnate?"]
244: 2382| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 2385| [45] ["If it weren't for that, then a little more and you too could--"]
246: 2408| [45] [Subject N gave a wry smile to Natsuhiko's question.]
247: 2416| [47] [Subject N]
248: 2419| [45] ["... That's just another result of Senses Sympathy."]
249: 2427| [47] [Subject N]
250: 2430| [45] ["Though its form and volume may vary, everyone holds some kind of malice in their minds, no exceptions."]
251: 2456| [47] [Subject N]
252: 2459| [45] ["You'd be surprised at just how many people out there hate and discriminate against Communicators."]
253: 2485| [47] [Subject N]
254: 2488| [45] ["... Malice is harder to get rid of than you'd think, and it just keeps building up and up. It wormed its way into my mind little by little."]
255: 2514| [47] [Subject N]
256: 2517| [45] ["The malice of 351 people completely contaminated my mind."]
257: 2543| [47] [Subject N]
258: 2546| [45] ["And thus I became pure 'malice' itself."]
259: 2572| [47] [Subject N]
260: 2575| [45] ["I manipulate the memories of everyone I come into contact with, amplify their malice, and plant my spirit into their brains each time, allowing me to keep on creating copies of myself."]
261: 2583| [47] [Subject N]
262: 2586| [45] ["Instinctively propagating myself is the sole absolute behavioral value I have."]
263: 2594| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 2597| [45] ["... No way..."]
265: 2688| [45] [He couldn't understand that feeling.]
266: 2693| [45] [But on the other hand-- he'd finally realized something.]
267: 2698| [45] [He remembered the "monster" mentioned in the Seven Wonders.]
268: 2703| [45] ["If a Communicator uses BC without knowing the proper way, they will eventually turn into a mind-broken monster."]
269: 2708| [45] ["The monster will even break the minds of those around them with malice-filled BC."]
270: 2721| [45] [--Those rumors matched up perfectly with what Subject N was saying.]
271: 2726| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 2727| [45] [(So the monster... really did exist...!)]
273: 2732| [45] [The monster would then indiscriminately spread its malice like a radioactive object spreads its radiation.]
274: 2745| [45] [As a result, it didn't matter if she died or not.]
275: 2750| [45] [To Subject N, physical death apparently meant nothing.]
276: 2763| [47] [Natsuhiko]
277: 2764| [45] [(She's fallen too far off the beaten track...! She's a mere shadow of the Communicator she used to be!)]
278: 2769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
279: 2770| [45] [(Though she's lost her body, she still clings to people's minds and keeps on hating others! That's just...!)]
280: 2826| [45] [Natsuhiko stared at the girl before him.]
281: 2831| [45] [He wanted to defeat this monster right away.]
282: 2847| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 2850| [45] ["... I'll put a stop to you."]
284: 2858| [47] [Natsuhiko]
285: 2861| [45] ["I'm going to erase all your malice."]
286: 2874| [45] [He could do it. He had the means.]
287: 2879| [45] [All he had to do was completely erase the memory he was currently watching without leaving a single speck of it behind.]
288: 2892| [47] [Natsuhiko]
289: 2893| [45] [(Erasing the memory will damage Watase's brain... but I really don't have a choice this time!)]
290: 2924| [45] [Subject N looked at Natsuhiko and smirked.]
291: 2932| [47] [Subject N]
292: 2935| [45] ["Thanks for the consideration. But--"]
293: 2969| [47] [Subject N]
294: 2972| [45] ["Kid, haven't you noticed it yet?"]
295: 2980| [47] [Subject N]
296: 2983| [45] ["Looking into someone else's mind means letting them look into your own."]
297: 2991| [47] [Natsuhiko]
298: 2994| [45] ["...? What do you mean?"]
299: 3028| [47] [Subject N]
300: 3031| [45] ["I told you that using Senses Sympathy causes your mind to meld with your target's, right?"]
301: 3039| [47] [Subject N]
302: 3042| [45] ["And you've been watching Watase's malice-filled memories this whole time. In other words--"]
303: 3076| [47] [Subject N]
304: 3079| [45] ["I'm already infecting you too."]
305: 3102| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 3105| [45] ["!?"]
307: 3139| [47] [Subject N]
308: 3142| [45] ["What was it you thought about me earlier?"]
309: 3150| [47] [Subject N]
310: 3153| [45] ["Oh yes, you called me a 'monster', didn't you? Even though we're both Communicators."]
311: 3169| [47] [Subject N]
312: 3172| [45] ["I thought Communicators were your allies and Q was your enemy? Now that's odd. Where the hell did this 180 come from?"]
313: 3195| [47] [Natsuhiko]
314: 3198| [45] ["...!"]
315: 3232| [47] [Subject N]
316: 3235| [45] ["Just fooling with you, kid. You haven't pulled a 180 at all, right?"]
317: 3243| [47] [Subject N]
318: 3246| [45] ["You were going to erase Watase's memories without the slightest hesitation just a little while ago, yeah?"]
319: 3262| [47] [Subject N]
320: 3265| [45] ["Even though you know that he could die from any further brain damage you give him."]
321: 3273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
322: 3276| [45] ["Ah... n-no, I...!"]
323: 3310| [47] [Subject N]
324: 3313| [45] ["Now you see? You're already 'one of us'."]
325: 3321| [47] [Subject N]
326: 3324| [45] ["You just screw around with Watase's head however you like as if it's your own little plaything."]
327: 3332| [47] [Subject N]
328: 3335| [45] ["You use inhuman abilities to your heart's content to stomp on others. You know what they call a being like that?"]
329: 3369| [47] [Subject N]
330: 3372| [45] ["A monster, that's what."]
331: 3395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
332: 3398| [45] ["--!!"]
333: 3403| [45] [Natsuhiko shouted voicelessly.]
334: 3434| [45] [Subject N walked over to Natsuhiko.]
335: 3442| [47] [Subject N]
336: 3445| [45] ["See... try thinking back on it."]
337: 3461| [47] [Subject N]
338: 3464| [45] ["Your memories are filling up with malice."]
339: 3472| [47] [Subject N]
340: 3475| [45] ["But you probably can't even remember how those memories actually used to be anymore, huh, kid?"]
341: 3491| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 3494| [45] ["H... huh?"]
343: 3499| [45] [Natsuhiko cried out in a hollow voice--]
344: 3504| [45] [And a memory of Watase flashed through his head.]
345: 3653| [47] [Watase]
346: 3656| [45] ["You erased my memories...? You son of a bitch!"]
347: 3682| [47] [Watase]
348: 3685| [45] ["Give me back my memories if you don't want to die!"]
349: 3868| [45] [--It was his memory of what'd happened just before he began the memory repair procedure.]
350: 3873| [45] [He felt like that wasn't quite what'd happened, but--]
351: 3899| [47] [Subject N]
352: 3902| [45] ["No, that is what happened. Watase held you at gunpoint and forced you to restore his memories."]
353: 3949| [45] [Subject N's whispers shook Natsuhiko's heart.]
354: 4003| [47] [Natsuhiko]
355: 4004| [45] [(Th-that's right, I was...!)]
356: 4023| [47] [Natsuhiko]
357: 4024| [45] [(I was forced by Watase to restore his memories or else...!)]
358: 4043| [47] [Natsuhiko]
359: 4044| [45] [(In that case, why don't I just get the jump on Watase...)]
360: 4063| [47] [Natsuhiko]
361: 4064| [45] [(I'd be better off just completely destroying his memories again...!)]
362: 4083| [45] [Twisted intentions welled up in Natsuhiko's mind.]
363: 4102| [45] [His fear and hatred of Watase filled his heart.]
364: 4121| [47] [Natsuhiko]
365: 4122| [45] [(That's right, that'd be for the best! Besides, the bastard's a terrorist! He--)]
366: 4127| [45] [But at that moment...]
367: 4269| [85] [{Hikorin, don't do it!}]
368: 4270| [86] [Yuuri]
369: 4271| [86] [{Hikorin, don't do it!}]
370: 4317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
371: 4320| [45] ["!?"]
372: 4325| [45] [Yuuri's voice echoed in his brain.]
373: 4333| [47] [Natsuhiko]
374: 4336| [45] ["Y-Yuuri! Why can I hear your voice!?"]
375: 4344| [47] [Natsuhiko]
376: 4347| [45] ["Where are you!?"]
377: 4415| [47] [Yuuri]
378: 4418| [45] [{I've been with you from the very beginning.}]
379: 4423| [47] [Yuuri]
380: 4426| [45] [{I dove into your mind at the same time you dove into Captain Kasasagi's.}]
381: 4434| [47] [Natsuhiko]
382: 4437| [45] ["...!"]
383: 4442| [47] [Yuuri]
384: 4445| [45] [{Remember what I told you? Just remember me when it looks like you'll lose to the malice.}]
385: 4469| [47] [Yuuri]
386: 4472| [45] [{I'll restore your memories to normal now.}]
387: 4534| [45] [And with those words-- the true memory of that time came rushing through Natsuhiko's brain.]
388: 4788| [47] [Watase]
389: 4791| [45] ["You erased my memories...? You son of a bitch!"]
390: 4954| [47] [Watase]
391: 4957| [45] ["--Your greatest fear is the chance that I'll attack you guys 'again' once I get my memories back, right?"]
392: 4983| [47] [Watase]
393: 4986| [45] ["If I try to attack you as soon as I get my memories back, then shoot me down. Don't hesitate."]
394: 5012| [47] [Watase]
395: 5015| [45] ["I'd rather die than kill you guys."]
396: 5188| [47] [Natsuhiko]
397: 5191| [45] ["Ah..."]
398: 5196| [47] [Yuuri]
399: 5199| [45] [{See? Captain Kasasagi didn't force you to restore his memories at gunpoint at all.}]
400: 5204| [47] [Yuuri]
401: 5207| [45] [{There's no need to erase all his memories.}]
402: 5231| [47] [Yuuri]
403: 5234| [45] [{The only one you have to erase is the one you're seeing right now.}]
404: 5239| [47] [Yuuri]
405: 5242| [45] [{When you do... Captain Kasasagi will be set free from N's curse. So let's do it.}]
406: 5250| [47] [Natsuhiko]
407: 5253| [45] ["Y... yeah!"]
408: 5328| [45] [Natsuhiko said that and looked at Subject N.]
409: 5354| [47] [Subject N]
410: 5357| [45] ["... Oh, what's this? Not going to erase Watase's memory?"]
411: 5365| [47] [Natsuhiko]
412: 5368| [45] ["No, I will. But--"]
413: 5376| [47] [Natsuhiko]
414: 5379| [45] ["I'll only erase this one-- only your spirit."]
415: 5446| [47] [Subject N]
416: 5449| [45] ["...!?"]
417: 5454| [45] [Subject N's face froze for the first time.]
418: 5480| [47] [Subject N]
419: 5483| [45] ["Hey... you saying you're gonna erase me, kid?"]
420: 5491| [47] [Subject N]
421: 5494| [45] ["When I'm only barely clinging to life here in Watase's brain?"]
422: 5502| [47] [Natsuhiko]
423: 5505| [45] ["Yeah... that should be the best for you too."]
424: 5531| [47] [Subject N]
425: 5534| [45] ["What?"]
426: 5542| [47] [Natsuhiko]
427: 5545| [45] ["I feel sad for you. You continue to hate people even after your body's died and you've been reduced to a mere spirit."]
428: 5553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
429: 5556| [45] ["You must be tired of it all, right? ... So I'll put you to rest now."]
430: 5582| [47] [Subject N]
431: 5585| [45] ["Don't try to justify yourself by sugarcoating things, you hypocrite!"]
432: 5593| [47] [Subject N]
433: 5596| [45] ["When it comes down to it, you're just trying to get rid of me for your own good, aren't you!?"]
434: 5619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
435: 5622| [45] ["--"]
436: 5627| [45] [Natsuhiko hesitated for an instant.]
437: 5632| [45] [His guilt and sympathy for Subject N came rising up.]
438: 5637| [45] [However--]
439: 5705| [47] [Yuuri]
440: 5708| [45] [{Hikorin... I'll bear the burden of this sin with you as well...}]
441: 5713| [47] [Yuuri]
442: 5716| [45] [{I feel bad for N too... but in the end...}]
443: 5740| [47] [Yuuri]
444: 5743| [45] [{We have to do this for Captain Kasasagi...!}]
445: 5767| [45] [Natsuhiko felt a warm sensation on his hand accompany that voice.]
446: 5772| [45] [He could tell Yuuri was holding his hand.]
447: 5802| [45] [Natsuhiko stared at Subject N and spoke.]
448: 5810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
449: 5813| [45] ["... I'll remember you."]
450: 5839| [47] [Subject N]
451: 5842| [45] ["You think that makes me happy!?"]
452: 5850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
453: 5853| [45] ["No, please tell me. Anything you remember about yourself. Anything at all."]
454: 5861| [47] [Natsuhiko]
455: 5864| [45] ["Like, for example, oh, I know-- what's your real name?"]
456: 5869| [45] [The girl responded in a depressed voice.]
457: 5895| [47] [Subject N]
458: 5898| [45] ["... I don't have one."]
459: 5906| [47] [Subject N]
460: 5909| [45] ["I was born in this facility and lived here until today. What the hell's a lab rat gonna do with a name?"]
461: 5932| [47] [Natsuhiko]
462: 5935| [45] ["..."]
463: 6003| [45] [Natsuhiko then remembered something he'd seen.]
464: 6008| [45] [It was a sentence from the data Ena had extracted from LABO's computers about the specifications of a Case N.]
465: 6013| [45] ["Subject****as born in LABO."]
466: 6018| [45] [--Perhaps that line referred to this girl.]
467: 6100| [47] [Subject N]
468: 6103| [45] ["... This dim underground facility is my entire world."]
469: 6111| [47] [Subject N]
470: 6114| [45] ["The little I remember is just memories of LABO, too."]
471: 6122| [47] [Subject N]
472: 6125| [45] ["Maybe I would have been given another name had I lived in the normal world."]
473: 6151| [47] [Subject N]
474: 6154| [45] ["But I was born in this BC facility."]
475: 6162| [47] [Subject N]
476: 6165| [45] ["I bore the role of 'test subject'..."]
477: 6173| [47] [Natsuhiko]
478: 6176| [45] ["... You..."]
479: 6181| [45] [Her words and expression wrenched at Natsuhiko's heart.]
480: 6186| [45] [He had at least wanted to call her by her name at the very end, but he couldn't even do that.]
481: 6194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
482: 6197| [45] ["I'm sorry... Subject N."]
483: 6223| [47] [Subject N]
484: 6226| [45] ["... Don't apologize, you monster."]
485: 6231| [45] [And as Natsuhiko felt the pain in the girl's heart through her voice--]
486: 6300| [45] [--he erased that memory.]
