  1:   60| [45] [--When Watase ran down the emergency staircase,]
  2:  172| [45] [he found the sea of flames still there.]
  3:  177| [45] [He could see Kazami and Jun holding two hoses as they desperately suppressed the fire,%Nthe sound of the Procyon's alarm beeping in the background.]
  4:  212| [47] [Jun]
  5:  215| [45] ["Oh, you came back!?"]
  6:  256| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  259| [45] ["Captain! Are you sure you're okay!?"]
  8:  267| [47] [Watase]
  9:  270| [45] ["Your concern is unnecessary! Anyway, is there anything I can help with!?"]
 10:  342| [47] [Jun]
 11:  345| [45] ["I'd like you to help us put out the fire, but, well--"]
 12:  350| [45] [Watase checked the area around him as he listened to Jun.]
 13:  361| [45] [Everywhere except for where Kazami and Jun were standing was engulfed in flames.]
 14:  366| [45] [With the air full of heat waves and steam, every breath he took felt like it was setting his lungs on fire.]
 15:  392| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  395| [45] ["It's too dangerous for you in your current condition! Please fall back!"]
 17:  410| [47] [Watase]
 18:  411| [45] [(No, "firefighting is all about teamwork"! There must be something that I can do too!)]
 19:  416| [45] [Watase stood frozen in place.]
 20:  470| [45] [He hesitated for a second, wondering if he should just do as Kazami said and fall back--]
 21:  475| [47] [Watase]
 22:  476| [45] [(No, "firefighting is all about teamwork"!)]
 23:  490| [47] [Watase]
 24:  491| [45] [(There must be something I can do too!)]
 25:  496| [45] [Watase stood frozen in place.]
 26:  510| [47] [Watase]
 27:  513| [45] ["I'll watch the fire from the rear! That way, I can let you know if I see something strange!"]
 28:  539| [47] [Jun]
 29:  542| [45] ["Yes, thank you, Captain!"]
 30:  568| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  571| [45] ["Much obliged!"]
 32:  635| [45] [The two of them shouted that and continued hosing down the fire.]
 33:  640| [47] [Watase]
 34:  641| [45] [(But this fire looks far beyond the control of human hands at this point...!)]
 35:  646| [45] [Just as Watase thought that--]
 36:  780| [45] [Some of the nearby flames surged upward fiercely.]
 37:  788| [47] [Watase]
 38:  791| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 39:  796| [45] [A tongue of flame which had been licking at the ceiling nimbly waved towards the floor.]
 40:  801| [45] [It was almost like the writhing of a giant snake--]
 41:  815| [47] [Watase]
 42:  818| [45] ["H-hey guys, what's that!?"]
 43:  867| [47] [Jun]
 44:  870| [45] ["!? Oh shit, it's rolling over!"]
 45:  927| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  930| [45] ["We'll never last against that! All hands retreat!"]
 47:  935| [45] [Even Watase could tell that whatever was happening was no laughing matter.]
 48:  943| [47] [Watase]
 49:  946| [45] ["T-this way, guys!"]
 50:  958| [45] [Watase opened the emergency staircase door.]
 51: 1013| [45] [Kazami and Jun threw aside their hoses at the same time and ran for the stairs.]
 52: 1018| [45] [Watase followed them on nigh-instinct.]
 53: 1075| [47] [Watase]
 54: 1078| [45] ["Hurry!"]
 55: 1083| [45] [The whole group crowded their way up the stairs as fast as they could.]
 56: 1139| [45] [Watase closed the fireproof door to the stairwell as soon as they made it back to B1.]
 57: 1144| [45] [And not even a second later-- the door shook with a roar.]
 58: 1249| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1252| [45] ["Agh!"]
 60: 1308| [45] [Watase was knocked down by the shockwave occurring on the other side.]
 61: 1313| [45] [He landed on his side and felt a keen pain run through the area around his ribs.]
 62: 1359| [47] [Watase]
 63: 1362| [45] ["Ghh, ugh...!"]
 64: 1373| [45] [He quickly shut the door again as he groaned.]
 65: 1378| [45] [It looked like an explosion had happened downstairs, and the blast had made it all the way up the stairs.]
 66: 1383| [45] ["If we'd been even a second slower..."-- That thought sent shivers down Watase's spine.]
 67: 1391| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1394| [45] ["Wh... what was that explosion?"]
 69: 1456| [47] [Jun]
 70: 1459| [45] ["A 'flashover'."]
 71: 1467| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1470| [45] ["A phenomenon where an explosion occurs when fire that's covering an entire area suddenly goes through thermal expansion."]
 73: 1496| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1499| [45] ["You saw how those flames were rolling like they were alive, right? That was a forewarning to it, so to speak."]
 75: 1507| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1510| [45] ["So that's why you told us to run..."]
 77: 1515| [45] [If they'd stayed there, they would all be burning to death right about now.]
 78: 1520| [45] [Watase gulped as it fully hit him just how ferocious that fire had been.]
 79: 1525| [45] [His ribs still ached from when he'd been knocked to the floor.]
 80: 1533| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1536| [45] ["But I'm glad we're all in one piece..."]
 82: 1613| [45] [He looked at Kazami as he said that-- only to find her leaning against the wall, her hand gripping her head.]
 83: 1621| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1624| [45] ["...!? Tachibana, what's wrong!?"]
 85: 1650| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1653| [45] ["N-nothing... just got a bit dizzy and a little headache all of a sudden..."]
 87: 1679| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1682| [45] ["A headache!? Could it be because you went downstairs without enough AD!?"]
 89: 1687| [45] [The fiery hallway they'd just escaped from had a reading of about "4300 mSv" according to the Procyon.]
 90: 1692| [45] [That was over the first danger standard-- an extremely dangerous zone to those without any AD.]
 91: 1700| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1703| [45] ["H-hey... you okay, Tachibana!?"]
 93: 1775| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1778| [45] ["... I-I'm fine, no problems at all."]
 95: 1786| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1789| [45] ["But to think the radiation would--"]
 97: 1815| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1818| [45] ["If they were subjective symptoms of radiation damage, they should not be manifesting this quickly."]
 99: 1826| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1829| [45] ["This is more likely due to carbon monoxide overexposure."]
101: 1834| [45] [Her face was still a bit pale.]
102: 1854| [47] [Watase]
103: 1857| [45] ["'Carbon monoxide overexposure'... don't you think you're being a bit too optimistic there?"]
104: 1865| [47] [Watase]
105: 1868| [45] ["I mean, I fainted right after I went into a contaminated zone even with AD."]
106: 1894| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1897| [45] ["...!"]
108: 1905| [47] [Watase]
109: 1908| [45] ["It could be way too dangerous for you, considering you didn't take a proper shot of--"]
110: 1934| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1937| [45] ["I am aware of all that! You do not have to remind me!"]
112: 1945| [47] [Watase]
113: 1948| [45] ["...!"]
114: 1953| [45] [Watase instinctively shut up at Kazami's sharp voice.]
115: 1958| [47] [Watase]
116: 1959| [45] [(Dammit, all I did was drive her into a corner...!)]
117: 1964| [45] [As Watase stood there, regretting his words, Kazami's face softened in realization.]
118: 1990| [47] [Kazami]
119: 1993| [45] ["... My apologies. I lost my composure for a moment there."]
120: 2019| [47] [Kazami]
121: 2022| [45] ["At any rate, let's head back to the control room. Going back to the lower floor is no longer an option."]
122: 2035| [47] [Watase]
123: 2036| [45] [(Maybe she's right, but we can't be optimistic, can we?)]
124: 2041| [45] [Even Watase had fainted with a violent headache right after he'd entered a contaminated zone.]
125: 2046| [45] [It was way too dangerous for someone without a full ampule of AD in their system like Kazami.]
126: 2051| [45] [Kazami spoke up with a firm voice as Watase thought that.]
127: 2077| [47] [Kazami]
128: 2080| [45] ["... At any rate, let's head back to the control room. Going back to the lower floor is no longer an option."]
129: 2088| [47] [Watase]
130: 2091| [45] ["R-right..."]
131: 2117| [47] [Jun]
132: 2120| [45] ["... Yeah."]
133: 2163| [45] [Kazami then started walking on ahead, followed shortly afterwards by Watase and Jun.]
134: 2168| [45] [--So that dosage of AD really hadn't been enough for her.]
135: 2173| [45] [Though injecting oneself with a drug stored in a damaged container was already in of itself extremely dangerous.]
136: 2178| [47] [Watase]
137: 2179| [45] [(We need to find some AD on the double...!)]
138: 2190| [45] [Watase then whispered into Jun's ear.]
139: 2253| [47] [Watase]
140: 2256| [45] ["... Moribe, Tachibana looks like she's having a real hard time. We have to support her..."]
141: 2282| [47] [Jun]
142: 2285| [45] ["I know that already! I know that..!"]
143: 2290| [45] [Watase and Jun nodded at each other and quickly marched towards the control room.]
144: 2296| [45] [Watase reaffirmed his determination and quickly marched towards the control room.]
