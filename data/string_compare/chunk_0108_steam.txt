  1:    8| [47] [Jun]
  2:   11| [45] ["W-what do you mean by 'something'...?"]
  3:   19| [47] [Kazami]
  4:   22| [45] ["Moribe, use the air jack and the engine cutter!"]
  5:   30| [47] [Jun]
  6:   33| [45] ["But aren't they in Area 2? We don't have time to go all the way back for the--"]
  7:   41| [47] [Kazami]
  8:   44| [45] ["Yes we do! It shouldn't take that long if you go through Area 1 to get there!"]
  9:   49| [45] [That was exactly what Watase had been thinking-- his instincts had been right after all.]
 10:   57| [47] [Kazami]
 11:   60| [45] ["Moribe, please bring them here ASAP!"]
 12:   68| [47] [Jun]
 13:   71| [45] ["Roger! I'll be back in two minutes tops, so hang in there, Captain!"]
 14:   85| [47] [Kazami]
 15:   88| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, help me try to get as much debris off as possible until Moribe returns!"]
 16:   96| [47] [Ena]
 17:   99| [45] ["Okay, let's get started now!"]
 18:  107| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  110| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
 20:  118| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  121| [45] ["Start moving this debris off!"]
 22:  147| [45] [Jun left the factory as Kazami, Ena, and Ukita started removing the debris.]
 23:  152| [45] [But a minute later--]
 24:  157| [45] [Watase's arms started shaking rapidly.]
 25:  165| [47] [Watase]
 26:  168| [45] ["Khh...!"]
 27:  173| [45] [He couldn't imagine how many kilograms he was holding up.]
 28:  178| [45] [His spread elbows creaked, feeling like they'd snap like twigs at any second.]
 29:  183| [47] [Watase]
 30:  184| [45] [(Moribe... please hurry up...!)]
 31:  189| [45] [Yuuri's faced scrunched up grimly as if she could tell what Watase was feeling.]
 32:  237| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  240| [45] ["I'm so sorry... it's all my fault that you got trapped here too..."]
 34:  248| [47] [Watase]
 35:  251| [45] ["Y-you dummy... don't... apologize for nothing..."]
 36:  259| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  262| [45] ["O-okay..."]
 38:  270| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  273| [45] ["... But why..."]
 40:  281| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  284| [45] ["Why are you going this far to save my life?"]
 42:  292| [47] [Watase]
 43:  295| [45] ["W-why? Well..."]
 44:  300| [45] [It was then that Watase remembered--]
 45:  401| [85] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
 46:  402| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
 47:  403| [86] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
 48:  510| [45] [--the voice he'd heard in his head shortly after he'd woken up.]
 49:  515| [47] [Watase]
 50:  516| [45] [(I see... so ever since I heard that voice, I've been...)]
 51:  524| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  527| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi...?"]
 53:  532| [45] [Yuuri looked confused at Watase's sudden silence.]
 54:  537| [45] [It was at that moment that they heard Jun's voice.]
 55:  551| [47] [Jun]
 56:  554| [45] ["Sorry to keep you all waiting! What's the situation!?"]
 57:  562| [47] [Watase]
 58:  565| [45] ["Pretty... bad... to be honest... h-hurry up!"]
 59:  573| [47] [Kazami]
 60:  576| [45] ["Understood! Moribe, get the air jack ready ASAP!"]
 61:  584| [47] [Jun]
 62:  587| [45] ["It's on standby now! Your orders!?"]
 63:  595| [47] [Kazami]
 64:  598| [45] ["First, cut along this line from here to there with the engine cutter!"]
 65:  606| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  609| [45] ["Put the air jack in the newly created hole after that! Then lift the debris up and get those two out of there!"]
 67:  617| [47] [Jun]
 68:  620| [45] ["Roger! Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, get back now!"]
 69:  628| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  631| [45] ["Now commencing cutting procedure!"]
 71:  652| [45] [The two rescue workers then began removing the debris--]
 72:  657| [47] [Watase]
 73:  658| [45] [(Ghh... g-goddammit...!)]
 74:  663| [45] [But the strength in Watase's arms was fading quickly.]
 75:  668| [45] [It wouldn't surprise him if the weight of the debris won out any second now.]
 76:  673| [47] [Watase]
 77:  674| [45] [(I-I would have ordered Tachibana and Moribe right away back then if I'd known... this was going... to happen...)]
 78:  679| [45] [Those lost ten seconds had cost him everything.]
 79:  693| [47] [Yuuri]
 80:  696| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi...!"]
 81:  701| [45] [Yuuri looked anxious.]
 82:  706| [45] [But Watase no longer had the composure to say anything comforting to her.]
 83:  711| [45] [The debris was sinking further and further into his back.]
 84:  716| [45] [That was merely an illusion, but one that felt more than real enough.]
 85:  721| [47] [Watase]
 86:  722| [45] [(Moribe... please hurry up...!)]
 87:  727| [45] [That one second felt-------- so long.]
 88:  732| [45] [The vibrations of the engine cutter were like poison to Watase now.]
 89:  737| [45] [And at the end of what felt like an eternity of agony--]
 90:  790| [45] [Part of the debris was removed, and a light shone in on Yuuri's face.]
 91:  795| [45] [But at that moment--]
 92:  800| [45] [Watase hit his limit.]
 93:  805| [45] [He could tell that the muscle fibers in his arms were starting to burst.]
 94:  810| [45] [He really didn't have any more time.]
 95:  815| [47] [Watase]
 96:  816| [45] [(Sh... shit... I've got to make sure... that at least Yuuri... gets out...!)]
 97:  821| [45] [With Yuuri's small body, it was probably possible for her to escape through the hole that'd been opened just now.]
 98:  829| [47] [Kazami]
 99:  832| [45] ["Captain, put up with it for a little longer! We're getting the air jack rea--"]
100:  837| [45] [Watase forced his voice out in order to interrupt her.]
101:  845| [47] [Watase]
102:  848| [45] ["Tachibana...! Pull Yuuri out right now...!"]
103:  856| [47] [Yuuri]
104:  859| [45] ["Huh...?"]
105:  867| [47] [Kazami]
106:  870| [45] ["C-Captain?"]
107:  878| [47] [Watase]
108:  881| [45] ["--Tachibana, hurry! This is an order!"]
109:  886| [45] [It was practically a miracle that he'd managed to shout that.]
110:  894| [47] [Kazami]
111:  897| [45] ["Y-yes!"]
112:  902| [45] [Kazami took Yuuri's hand and quickly pulled her outside.]
113:  951| [45] [The strength in Watase's arms then gave way then and there.]
114: 1029| [45] [His body was pulverized by the debris.]
115: 1034| [45] [--UGYAAAAAAAAAAAGH!]
116: 1039| [45] [That horrific scream burst out of his mouth.]
117: 1047| [47] [Kazami]
118: 1050| [45] ["CAPTAIN--!"]
119: 1058| [47] [Yuuri]
120: 1061| [45] ["NOOOOOOOOOOO!"]
121: 1066| [45] [Bones all throughout his body broke and pierced his lungs.]
122: 1071| [45] [He nearly passed out from the sheer pain of it all.]
123: 1076| [45] [A thought crossed Watase's mind amidst all that.]
124: 1081| [45] ["I'm glad I saved Yuuri."]
125: 1086| [45] [But another thought simultaneously hit him.]
126: 1091| [45] ["But were my actions just now really 'my actions'?"]
127: 1096| [45] [--Or maybe--]
128: 1197| [85] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
129: 1198| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
130: 1199| [86] [{Don't stop! Save her!}]
131: 1270| [45] [--if I'd never heard that voice--]
132: 1275| [45] [At that moment, it felt as if everything he'd been up until that point hadn't really been him.]
133: 1280| [45] [And just as Watase's conviction faded from his body...]
134: 1285| [45] [... his mind fell into darkness.]
135: 1373| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
136: 1376| [45] [√A Bad Ending #7 [The Egoless]]
137: 1379| [85] [　]
138: 1382| [45] [The result of underestimating the danger and not giving urgent orders quickly enough.]
139: 1385| [85] [　]
140: 1388| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Watase and Yuuri's Senses very high at the SSS input just before this ending.]
