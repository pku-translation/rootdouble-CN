  0:   45| [55] [√Before Chapter 8]
  1:   59| [45] [The blood poured endlessly.]
  2:  126| [45] [From his side. His left arm. His right leg.]
  3:  208| [45] [His sight went dark. His body cold.]
  4:  275| [45] [He knew he was losing too much blood.]
  5:  357| [45] [But no matter how bloody he got. No matter how much he ran, he could not find a single weapon to defeat the man.]
  6:  467| [45] [At the end of his aimless run--]
  7:  472| [45] [Natsuhiko arrived in a bizarre place.]
  8:  605| [45] [--A spacious hall of some sort.]
  9:  610| [45] [Giant cylindrical machines were lined up. Their whirring noises indicated they were operational.]
 10:  615| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  616| [45] [(Wh... what is this place...?)]
 12:  621| [45] [Natsuhiko did not remember how he had gotten there.]
 13:  626| [45] [His consciousness kept threatening to cut out.]
 14:  631| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  632| [45] [(... N-no... Who cares about that?)]
 16:  637| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  638| [45] [(Is there anything I can use as a weapon--?)]
 18:  643| [45] [Natsuhiko's hazy thoughts ]
 19:  666| [45] [were drowned out by a gunshot.]
 20:  680| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  683| [45] ["Gah...!"]
 22:  737| [45] [With another bullet pierced into his left arm, Natsuhiko collapsed to the ground.]
 23:  792| [45] [His brachial artery seemed to have ruptured as a fountain of blood gushed out.]
 24:  797| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  798| [45] [(I... I can't...!)]
 26:  803| [45] [The wound was likely fatal.]
 27:  808| [45] [As Natsuhiko sank into a puddle of blood, the man's voice rained down upon him.]
 28:  870| [47] [Watase]
 29:  873| [45] ["--So this is where you die?"]
 30:  878| [45] [The man had apparently followed him all the way here.]
 31:  883| [45] [Natsuhiko hadn't even realized it.]
 32:  909| [47] [Watase]
 33:  912| [45] ["This is the perfect gravesite for you monsters."]
 34:  937| [45] [The man trampled Natsuhiko's hand, smashing the security card in his grip.]
 35:  942| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  943| [45] [(Agh... gh...)]
 37:  948| [45] [Pain ran through his trampled hand, but he could no longer even scream.]
 38:  953| [45] [As Natsuhiko slowly looked up, the man questioned him.]
 39:  979| [47] [Watase]
 40:  982| [45] ["How does it feel? Does it hurt?"]
 41:  987| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  988| [45] ["..."]
 43: 1014| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1017| [45] ["Well, I'm sure it's nowhere near the level of pain the light of my life suffered at the hands of you monsters."]
 45: 1025| [47] [Watase]
 46: 1028| [45] ["But please, enjoy your 10,000th of that pain as you die there."]
 47: 1033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48: 1034| [45] ["..."]
 49: 1039| [45] [Natsuhiko could say nothing.]
 50: 1044| [45] [All he could do was question what he had just heard.]
 51: 1049| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52: 1050| [45] [(What is he talking about...)]
 53: 1055| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54: 1056| [45] [(... Who is this "light of his life"...?)]
 55: 1155| [45] [But before he could find the answer to that question, his vision went dark.]
 56: 1160| [45] [The man turned back and said,]
 57: 1168| [47] [Watase]
 58: 1171| [45] ["... After you comes the girl."]
 59: 1179| [47] [Watase]
 60: 1182| [45] ["So long, Communicator."]
 61: 1200| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1201| [45] [(--!?)]
 63: 1206| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped to hear those words.]
 64: 1317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1318| [45] [(No way, he's going to chase Mashiro...)]
 66: 1369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1370| [45] [(And kill her...!?)]
 68: 1467| [45] [In an instant, Natsuhiko's consciousness came rushing back.]
 69: 1472| [45] [The desire to protect Mashiro roused him.]
 70: 1477| [45] [His body had already lost a large volume of blood. He probably didn't have much longer.]
 71: 1482| [45] [He had no weapons. Telepathy was useless.]
 72: 1487| [45] [But even so--]
 73: 1492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 1493| [45] [(... Think of a way to stop him...!)]
 75: 1507| [45] [In an instant, Natsuhiko's thoughts ran wild.]
 76: 1512| [45] [In the situation devoid of all hope.]
 77: 1517| [45] [And inside the endless darkness--]
 78: 1616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1617| [45] [(...!)]
 80: 1622| [45] [He found a single ray of hope.]
 81: 1627| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1628| [45] [(... My... ability...)]
 83: 1633| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1634| [45] [(The power to connect minds rather than just brains...)]
 85: 1639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1640| [45] [(Can I use that to defeat him...!?)]
 87: 1685| [45] [When he had connected with Mashiro's heart, he saw her memories as if they were his own.]
 88: 1690| [45] [Each memory seemed delicate, fragile, easy to break.]
 89: 1737| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1738| [45] [(But obviously, that wasn't reality...)]
 91: 1743| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1744| [45] [(That was just a visualization of the brain activity inside Mashiro's head, wasn't it...!?)]
 93: 1749| [45] [He had no idea what the underlying principles behind the third ability were.]
 94: 1754| [45] [But it felt like diving into people's memories--]
 95: 1759| [45] [It was an aberrant BC ability that allowed direct interference with the brain's function.]
 96: 1764| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1765| [45] [(If that's the case, then depending on how I go about it, perhaps I could use it to deal direct damage to his brain...!)]
 98: 1770| [45] [It was hardly a glimmer of hope, but rather nothing more than wishful thinking.]
 99: 1775| [45] [But as he thought about it, Natsuhiko remembered something.]
100: 1788| [45] [In particular, he remembered the last of "Rokumei City's Seven Wonders". The one he could not remember when they were telling them to Salyu.]
101: 1793| [45] [It was the reverse of Wonder Number 5, which was "If a Communicator uses BC without knowing the proper way, their mind will eventually break."]
102: 1881| [85] [　%N　%N]
103: 1885| [47] [Rokumei City's Seven Wonders, Number 7:]
104: 1891| [47] [If a Communicator excessively misuses BC--]
105: 1897| [47] [--their target's mind will eventually break--]
106: 2040| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 2041| [45] [(Is... is this what it meant...!?)]
108: 2046| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 2047| [45] [(Can powerful BC really break the target's mind!?)]
110: 2052| [45] [As soon as he got that idea,]
111: 2073| [45] [Natsuhiko's entire body regained its strength.]
112: 2111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 2114| [45] ["Waaaaggghhh!"]
114: 2163| [45] [Natsuhiko stood up and rushed at the man.]
115: 2189| [47] [Watase]
116: 2192| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
117: 2203| [45] [The man turned around and readied his gun.]
118: 2208| [45] [But just a second sooner-- Natsuhiko grabbed the man by the wrist.]
119: 2281| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2284| [45] ["Like hell I'm gonna let you!!"]
121: 2368| [47] [Watase]
122: 2371| [45] ["!?"]
123: 2376| [45] [The man's face stiffened.]
124: 2381| [45] [As Natsuhiko desperately grasped the man's wrist,]
125: 2389| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 2392| [45] ["... Haaah..."]
127: 2397| [45] [he took a deep breath,]
128: 2507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
129: 2510| [45] ["Mm...--"]
130: 2515| [45] [And focused with all his mind and soul.]
131: 2625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 2628| [45] ["----!!"]
133: 2633| [45] [It was the same as when he entered Mashiro's mind.]
134: 2638| [45] [Natsuhiko focused on his intent to expose the man's mind, not to know it, but to destroy it--!]
135: 2746| [47] [Natsuhiko]
136: 2747| [45] [(!!)]
137: 2752| [45] [That moment, Natsuhiko's vision tumbled into darkness.]
138: 2801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 2802| [45] [(All right! It's the same as how it was with Mashiro!)]
140: 2807| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2808| [45] [(Now to destroy his mind and--!)]
142: 2813| [45] [But what Natsuhiko saw terrified him.]
143: 2979| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2980| [45] [(What... what the hell is this!?)]
145: 2985| [45] [The inside of the man's mind was completely different from Mashiro's.]
146: 3043| [85] [{--Kill, kill, kill, kill...!}]
147: 3044| [86] [Watase]
148: 3045| [86] [{--Kill, kill, kill, kill...!}]
149: 3063| [85] [{Communicators aren't human.]
150: 3065| [85] [They're mind-corrupting monsters.}]
151: 3066| [86] [Watase]
152: 3067| [86] [{Communicators aren't human. They're mind-corrupting monsters.}]
153: 3082| [85] [{This is a monster hunt...!]
154: 3084| [85] [Kill or be killed...!}]
155: 3085| [86] [Watase]
156: 3086| [86] [{This is a monster hunt...! Kill or be killed...!}]
157: 3101| [85] [{Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,]
158: 3103| [85] [kill, kill, kill, kill...}]
159: 3104| [86] [Watase]
160: 3105| [86] [{Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...}]
161: 3133| [45] [The man's distorted thoughts were swirling with tremendous hatred and killing intent.]
162: 3138| [45] [The visions of the memories floating about were likewise warped, ruined, and teeming with malice.]
163: 3143| [45] [--The man's mind was devoted to hatred towards Communicators.]
164: 3148| [45] [Resentment, indignation, lament, murderous rage. All sorts of negative emotions.]
165: 3153| [45] [Natsuhiko even felt the man's unadulterated emotions that could be neither verbalized, nor visualized.]
166: 3158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 3159| [45] [(Why is it all like this...!?)]
168: 3164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 3165| [45] [(No, more importantly... I need to destroy these memories!)]
170: 3170| [45] [Natsuhiko glared at the fragments of the man's memories.]
171: 3273| [47] [Natsuhiko]
172: 3274| [45] [(Shatter!!!)]
173: 3279| [45] [The moment he wished for their destruction,]
174: 3284| [45] [the visions burst and faded into the darkness--]
175: 3344| [47] [Watase]
176: 3347| [45] ["Agh, GAAAAAAAH!!"]
177: 3352| [45] [The man screamed.]
178: 3400| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 3403| [45] ["!!"]
180: 3408| [45] [Natsuhiko snapped back to his senses.]
181: 3419| [45] [The man dropped his gun and gazed at Natsuhiko in dumbfounded terror.]
182: 3445| [47] [Watase]
183: 3448| [45] ["Th-that was...!?"]
184: 3474| [47] [Watase]
185: 3477| [45] ["My head, it can't be... not you too!!"]
186: 3482| [45] [The man babbled ambiguously as he stared fearfully at Natsuhiko.]
187: 3487| [45] [However-- Natsuhiko was already at the end of his rope.]
188: 3492| [47] [Natsuhiko]
189: 3493| [45] [(I can't... go on...!)]
190: 3498| [47] [Natsuhiko]
191: 3499| [45] [(I can't... keep focusing...!)]
192: 3504| [45] [He glared at the man and tried to use BC, but he couldn't use his abilities.]
193: 3509| [45] [If he got shot by the man again, it would certainly be the end of his life.]
194: 3514| [45] [However--]
195: 3540| [47] [Watase]
196: 3543| [45] ["Aah... aah..."]
197: 3585| [47] [Watase]
198: 3588| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"]
199: 3593| [45] [The man turned around and ran like mad.]
200: 3664| [47] [Natsuhiko]
201: 3667| [45] ["Wait! ... Guh!"]
202: 3672| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to chase after him, but collapsed.]
203: 3739| [45] [The man's back faded into the distance.]
204: 3744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 3745| [45] [(His mind... is abnormal...!)]
206: 3750| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 3751| [45] [(Why would he hate Communicators so much...!?)]
208: 3756| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't believe it.]
209: 3761| [45] [What could drive someone to hate others so much?]
210: 3766| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3767| [45] [(Someone like that is dangerous...!)]
212: 3772| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 3773| [45] [(Someone like that can't be allowed to exist...!!)]
214: 3778| [45] [But Natsuhiko could no longer move so much as a finger.]
215: 3828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 3829| [45] [(Damn... it... I can't move... anymore...)]
217: 3834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
218: 3835| [45] [(Am I... going to die... here...!?)]
219: 3840| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness faded. The feeling of death loomed over him.]
220: 3845| [45] [But at that moment-- Mashiro came to mind.]
221: 3850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3851| [45] [(... No!)]
223: 3856| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3857| [45] [(I can't die here... not now... If I leave that terrorist alive... he'll kill Mashiro...!)]
225: 3862| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3863| [45] [(So at the very least...)]
227: 3868| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3869| [45] [(At the very least, I need to stop that man!)]
229: 3890| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind, the final flame of life ignited within Natsuhiko.]
230: 3895| [45] [He wasn't dead just yet.]
231: 3900| [45] [He still had his sight, his hearing, his touch, his smell, his taste-- and his pain sensitivity.]
232: 3905| [45] [As long as he was alive, he'd keep going until that final flame died out--]
233: 3910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3911| [45] [(You!!)]
235: 3916| [45] [Natsuhiko forced his body up.]
236: 3921| [45] [His hazy eyes caught sight of the man trying to leave the room.]
237: 3929| [47] [Natsuhiko]
238: 3932| [45] ["You're not..."]
239: 3970| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3973| [45] ["You're not getting away!!"]
241: 3978| [45] [As he steeled his fading consciousness, Natsuhiko focused with all his mind.]
242: 4028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
243: 4029| [45] [(--Show me all the memories that compose his mind!)]
244: 4034| [45] [And the moment that thought crossed his mind, countless visions twinkled in the darkness.]
245: 4039| [47] [Natsuhiko]
246: 4040| [45] [(This is all I can do now...!)]
247: 4045| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 4046| [45] [(So please... work...)]
249: 4112| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 4115| [45] [{Shatter!!}]
251: 4126| [45] [Natsuhiko used the last of his BC to destroy the man's mind.]
252: 4131| [45] [To destroy his enemy's inexhaustible malice, he crammed in malice of his own that surpassed it.]
253: 4136| [45] [And that moment--]
254: 4189| [47] [Watase]
255: 4192| [45] ["Ga... agh...!"]
256: 4197| [45] [The man's scream echoed from somewhere.]
257: 4210| [45] [After a split second, the man's body collapsed.]
258: 4215| [45] [Natsuhiko could no longer see, only hear--]
259: 4220| [45] [But he was convinced that he had destroyed the man's mind.]
260: 4231| [45] [As he heard the sound of the gate closing, Natsuhiko's lips curled up in a faint smile.]
261: 4236| [47] [Natsuhiko]
262: 4237| [45] [(I... did it...!)]
263: 4242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 4243| [45] [(Now... he can't attack Mashiro... anymore...)]
265: 4248| [45] [And with that conviction in his mind--]
266: 4347| [45] [--all strength left his body.]
267: 4352| [45] [His body grew cold. His sight grew dark.]
268: 4357| [45] [It was as if all his senses diluted. As if he became a mere spirit floating in the air...]
269: 4362| [45] [He felt like a ripple in the water.]
270: 4367| [45] [Death was near.]
271: 4372| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 4373| [45] [(... But...)]
273: 4378| [45] [But he was fine with that.]
274: 4383| [45] [As long as he was able to protect her.]
275: 4388| [45] [Natsuhiko's mind filled with warmth.]
276: 4393| [45] [And after that, suddenly--]
277: 4398| [45] [Nothingness swooped down upon him.]
278: 4450| [45] [In his fading consciousness, Natsuhiko thought.]
279: 4466| [45] [That he had finally accomplished something at the end of his 16 years of life.]
280: 4482| [47] [Natsuhiko]
281: 4483| [45] [(... Thank... goodness...)]
282: 4499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
283: 4500| [45] [(... I... saved... Mashiro...)]
284: 4516| [45] [He was able to repay his debt of nine years.]
285: 4532| [47] [Natsuhiko]
286: 4533| [45] [(... I erased... the malice...)]
287: 4549| [45] [He prided himself in that feat as he prayed.]
288: 4565| [47] [Natsuhiko]
289: 4566| [45] [(So... please... I hope... that this... never happens... again...)]
290: 4582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
291: 4583| [45] [(No... more... tragedies...)]
292: 4598| [45] [But that desire eventually disappeared as well.]
293: 4603| [47] [Natsuhiko]
294: 4604| [45] [(...)]
295: 4609| [45] [...]
296: 4614| [47] [Natsuhiko]
297: 4615| [45] [(...)]
298: 4620| [45] [...]
299: 4625| [47] [Natsuhiko]
300: 4626| [45] [(... Mashiro...)]
301: 4674| [45] [--At the end]
302: 4679| [45] [of his vague thoughts,]
303: 4684| [45] [he thought faintly]
304: 4689| [45] [about the girl]
305: 4694| [45] [who was precious to him--]
306: 4699| [45] [And then Natsuhiko's consciousness sank into the darkness.]
