  1:  151| [45] [--Watase kept himself from shivering and took in the terrifying spectacle that lay before his very eyes.]
  2:  159| [47] [Watase]
  3:  162| [45] ["D-dear God...!"]
  4:  207| [45] [The bodies at his feet were wearing what appeared to be white lab coats.]
  5:  212| [45] [It wasn't strange for there to be researchers in this facility.]
  6:  217| [45] [What -was- strange was the fact that their bodies were full of countless bullet holes.]
  7:  222| [47] [Watase]
  8:  223| [45] [(They were... shot?)]
  9:  228| [45] [Given that they were lying with their heads turned towards the door, it was possible that they'd been trying to escape from the room.]
 10:  233| [45] [The various sized holes in their body, especially the big ones in their stomachs, exposed their innards.]
 11:  238| [45] [The organ that had shaped whom they once were now oozed out of their split heads, leaving a slimy stain on the floor.]
 12:  306| [47] [Watase]
 13:  307| [45] [(Ghh...!)]
 14:  355| [45] [He instinctively looked away from the horrible evidence of how the men had died.]
 15:  400| [45] [But further in the room was one other body... the remains of the rescue worker who Kazami and Jun had called "Dojima".]
 16:  405| [45] [His case was even stranger.]
 17:  410| [45] [His limbs were bent in unnatural directions, his fingers broken at their bases as if they'd been tortured.]
 18:  415| [45] [Flesh from the nape of his neck had been torn off, blood oozing out from it, and the bones also appeared to have been twisted and crushed.]
 19:  420| [45] [His face was warped in agony, and his tongue was sticking out of his mouth in a slovenly matter.]
 20:  465| [47] [Watase]
 21:  466| [45] [(What... what the hell is this...!?)]
 22:  471| [47] [Watase]
 23:  472| [45] [(What could have happened to cause him to die like this...!?)]
 24:  477| [45] [It was hard to believe any human could have done this.]
 25:  482| [45] [It looked more like he'd been grabbed and casually crushed by a giant hand.]
 26:  487| [45] [It didn't feel as if any person could have done an act so horrific-- it was more like the work of a monster or something.]
 27:  492| [45] [But the whole thing in general was strange.]
 28:  497| [45] [Why was it that those two had been shot to death while this one had died differently?]
 29:  505| [47] [Watase]
 30:  508| [45] ["What in God's name happened in here...!?"]
 31:  513| [45] [Kazami answered, quietly rising to her feet.]
 32:  521| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  524| [45] ["... I don't know. However..."]
 34:  532| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  535| [45] ["It looks like they'd set up a simple makeshift base in this room..."]
 36:  540| [45] [When Watase looked at the room more closely, he noticed there were several objects that appeared to be broken equipment.]
 37:  548| [47] [Watase]
 38:  551| [45] ["What's this...?"]
 39:  559| [47] [Kazami]
 40:  562| [45] ["A jackhammer... they probably brought it here in order to break down walls and doors."]
 41:  567| [45] [Watase picked it up and pressed its switch.]
 42:  572| [45] [But it didn't respond at all. It looked like one of the bullets had shot the motor right out.]
 43:  577| [45] [There were two broken ampules lying nearby.]
 44:  585| [47] [Watase]
 45:  588| [45] ["! There's AD...!"]
 46:  596| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  599| [45] ["Ah...!"]
 48:  604| [45] [One of them had been smashed, like someone had stepped on it.]
 49:  609| [45] [The other one was still in its original form, but the container was cracked, the liquid inside leaking out.]
 50:  617| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  620| [45] ["It appears these are the ones they'd been given at the start..."]
 52:  625| [45] [Kazami picked up the cracked AD and said that.]
 53:  630| [45] [Just then, Jun broke her silence.]
 54:  638| [47] [Jun]
 55:  641| [45] ["Do you think... Dojima administered it to those people?"]
 56:  649| [47] [Kazami]
 57:  652| [45] ["... Yes, maybe. Dojima probably took those two under his protection and tried to come up with an escape plan."]
 58:  660| [47] [Jun]
 59:  663| [45] ["Just like us..."]
 60:  671| [47] [Jun]
 61:  674| [45] ["But... this doesn't make sense."]
 62:  682| [47] [Jun]
 63:  685| [45] ["Why did Dojima have to die...!?"]
 64:  690| [45] [Watase could say nothing as he watched Jun say that and hang her head.]
 65:  695| [45] [--He wasn't sad.]
 66:  700| [45] [It didn't feel real to him-- like it was an event that'd happened in a TV show.]
 67:  705| [45] [Even though it was his very own squadmate who was dead--]
 68:  710| [47] [Watase]
 69:  711| [45] [(... I'm...!)]
 70:  716| [45] [to the now amnesiac Watase, the death of his supposed squadmate "Dojima" felt the same as the death of a total stranger.]
 71:  721| [45] [And he hated himself for that.]
 72:  726| [45] [Kazami gently wrapped her arms around Jun's shoulders as the latter bit her lips.]
 73:  734| [47] [Kazami]
 74:  737| [45] ["... You mustn't let yourself dwell on this."]
 75:  742| [47] [Jun]
 76:  743| [45] ["..."]
 77:  751| [47] [Kazami]
 78:  754| [45] ["Judging from the fact that there's no sign of Hiyama's body anywhere, he's probably still alive. We can still save him at the very least..."]
 79:  762| [47] [Jun]
 80:  765| [45] ["... Yeah..."]
 81:  773| [47] [Kazami]
 82:  776| [45] ["Let's go for now... if we remain here much longer... then it'll be difficult even for me."]
 83:  781| [45] [Watase and Jun nodded and headed for the door with Kazami.]
 84:  824| [45] [--Kazami and Jun gave a small salute before they exited.]
 85:  829| [45] [Their final sendoff to their colleague who'd been killed under mysterious circumstances.]
 86:  834| [45] [All Watase did was just stand by and watch them...]
 87:  902| [45] [But the moment they left the room-- Ukita grabbed Watase by the collar.]
 88:  980| [47] [Ukita]
 89:  983| [45] ["Hey, Captain Kasasagi! What in the world happened here!?"]
 90:  991| [47] [Watase]
 91:  994| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
 92: 1017| [47] [Ukita]
 93: 1020| [45] ["Three people are dead, and even the jackhammer's broken...!"]
 94: 1061| [47] [Ukita]
 95: 1064| [45] ["You know something, don't you!? Answer me! Just talk already!"]
 96: 1072| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1075| [45] ["N-No...! How could I... know... anything..."]
 98: 1080| [45] [Kazami frantically pulled Ukita off of him.]
 99: 1123| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1126| [45] ["Mr. Ukita! Please calm down! Even we're confused about why our coworker was killed!"]
101: 1152| [47] [Ukita]
102: 1155| [45] ["How could I possibly stay calm in this situa--"]
103: 1160| [45] [But before Ukita could continue his ranting and raving--]
104: 1240| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1243| [45] ["P-please stop!"]
106: 1248| [45] [a tearful voice echoed around them.]
107: 1339| [47] [Ukita]
108: 1342| [45] ["--!?"]
109: 1350| [47] [Watase]
110: 1353| [45] ["Y-Yuuri!?"]
111: 1361| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1364| [45] ["D-don't panic...! People d-died there, right...?"]
113: 1372| [47] [Yuuri]
114: 1375| [45] ["If something like that happens again...!"]
115: 1380| [45] [It was the first time Watase had ever seen a look like that on Yuuri's face.]
116: 1385| [45] [It was still strained with fear, but there was a clear, fierce will in her eyes--]
117: 1390| [45] [Rationality returned to Ukita's eyes as soon as he heard her.]
118: 1416| [47] [Ukita]
119: 1419| [45] ["Ah... s-sorry..."]
120: 1427| [47] [Ukita]
121: 1430| [45] ["To think I of all people... would lose my composure like that.."]
122: 1438| [47] [Watase]
123: 1441| [45] ["... It's only natural."]
124: 1467| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1470| [45] ["By the way, were those researchers perchance acquaintances of yours, Mr. Ukita?"]
126: 1496| [47] [Ukita]
127: 1499| [45] ["No... to be honest, I don't know them."]
128: 1507| [47] [Watase]
129: 1510| [45] ["Huh?"]
130: 1536| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1539| [45] ["I-it's not my fault! The odds of ever seeing someone who doesn't work in your area are particularly low in this facility."]
132: 1544| [45] [There was something about Ukita's explanation that didn't sit right with Watase.]
133: 1549| [47] [Watase]
134: 1550| [45] [(If he didn't know them, then what was he getting so worked up for?)]
135: 1555| [45] [But Ena suddenly cut in.]
136: 1581| [47] [Ena]
137: 1584| [45] ["But still... why were they killed...?"]
138: 1610| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1613| [45] ["M-mmm... perhaps they were trying to steal AD?"]
140: 1621| [47] [Watase]
141: 1624| [45] ["No, I doubt that. There was still AD in that room, after all."]
142: 1632| [47] [Watase]
143: 1635| [45] ["The bigger question is why the killer had a gun. At least, it is to me..."]
144: 1661| [47] [Ena]
145: 1664| [45] ["Good point..."]
146: 1669| [45] [Ukita's eyes suddenly widened in shock at that moment.]
147: 1695| [47] [Ukita]
148: 1698| [45] ["Everyone, it would be best to be careful... the killer might still be in this facility."]
149: 1706| [47] [Watase]
150: 1709| [45] ["What!?"]
151: 1717| [47] [Ukita]
152: 1720| [45] ["If those three were killed after the lockdown began--"]
153: 1728| [47] [Ukita]
154: 1731| [45] ["Then naturally, that means the killer is also trapped in this facility, just like we are...!"]
155: 1739| [47] [Watase]
156: 1742| [45] ["!"]
157: 1768| [47] [Ukita]
158: 1771| [45] ["If someone with a gun is lurking around LABO... then it's not just fire and radiation we have to worry about."]
159: 1797| [47] [Ena]
160: 1800| [45] ["Wh-what the hell are you talking about!?"]
161: 1808| [47] [Ena]
162: 1811| [45] ["You're not saying that you suspect my students, are you!?"]
163: 1837| [47] [Ukita]
164: 1840| [45] ["No, that wasn't what I was getting at! There's no way children could do something so heartless, right!?"]
165: 1912| [47] [Ukita]
166: 1915| [45] ["But there might be someone dangerous still in the facility..."]
167: 1923| [47] [Ukita]
168: 1926| [45] ["So all I'm saying is that it might be best not to move around carelessly, even if we're here to search."]
169: 1952| [47] [Ena]
170: 1955| [45] ["Huh!? Quit acting like a spoiled brat!"]
171: 1963| [47] [Ena]
172: 1966| [45] ["That's all the more reason why we have to find my students quickly--"]
173: 1971| [45] [Watase frantically cut in just as it looked like another argument was about to start.]
174: 1987| [47] [Watase]
175: 1990| [45] ["Hold on a second, Mr. Ukita!"]
176: 2016| [47] [Ukita]
177: 2019| [45] ["Wh-what is it?"]
178: 2027| [47] [Watase]
179: 2030| [45] ["It's far too soon to assume the killer is trapped with us!"]
180: 2038| [47] [Watase]
181: 2041| [45] ["The killer should also be afraid of the fires and radiation, so why would they ever go out of their way to kill a rescue worker!?"]
182: 2067| [47] [Ena]
183: 2070| [45] ["Yes, Captain Kasasagi is right!"]
184: 2096| [47] [Ukita]
185: 2099| [45] ["Mmph..."]
186: 2104| [45] [Ukita shut his mouth at Watase and Ena's combined assault, with Kazami soon backing them up.]
187: 2116| [47] [Watase]
188: 2119| [45] ["Calm down, Teach! What Mr. Ukita's saying isn't really wrong, is it!?"]
189: 2145| [47] [Ena]
190: 2148| [45] ["What was that...? Are you two idiots!?"]
191: 2156| [47] [Watase]
192: 2159| [45] ["'Idiots'!?"]
193: 2167| [47] [Ena]
194: 2170| [45] ["Isn't it clearly way too early to assume that the killer is trapped here with us?"]
195: 2178| [47] [Ena]
196: 2181| [45] ["Even the killer should be afraid of the radiation and fires, so what reason would they have had to go out of their way to kill a rescue worker?"]
197: 2189| [47] [Watase]
198: 2192| [45] ["Mmph... that's certainly true..."]
199: 2197| [45] [Watase found himself shutting up at Ena's logic, with Kazami soon backing her up.]
200: 2225| [47] [Kazami]
201: 2228| [45] ["Yes... and what's more, the AD Dojima had was destroyed."]
202: 2254| [47] [Kazami]
203: 2257| [45] ["If Dojima had been killed after the lockdown started, the killer would have never broken it."]
204: 2265| [47] [Kazami]
205: 2268| [45] ["Those three were probably killed before the lockdown."]
206: 2294| [47] [Kazami]
207: 2297| [45] ["I don't know what the culprit's goal was... but if my theory is correct, then they should have had plenty of time after the murder to escape."]
208: 2302| [45] [Kazami's tone was calm, but her eyes were wavering.]
209: 2307| [45] [She too was grieving, and yet here she was, desperately reprimanding Ukita and Ena.]
210: 2333| [47] [Ukita]
211: 2336| [45] ["B-but... I'm just worrying about your safety as a member of this facility..."]
212: 2344| [47] [Kazami]
213: 2347| [45] ["Like I was saying, the killer's already escaped. We should go with that--"]
214: 2352| [45] [But before Kazami could say any more,]
215: 2364| [45] [a beep suddenly echoed through the hallway.]
