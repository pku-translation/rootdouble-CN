  1:   15| [47] [Watase]
  2:   18| [45] ["Wh-what the hell...!?"]
  3:   44| [47] [Ukita]
  4:   47| [45] ["So not only did you not find a body, but you didn't even stop like you said you did.%NWhy did you lie, hmm?"]
  5:   55| [47] [Watase]
  6:   58| [45] ["...!"]
  7:   63| [45] [Watase couldn't answer that question.]
  8:   89| [47] [Ukita]
  9:   92| [45] ["That's not all that's strange either. There's also the video's timestamp."]
 10:  101| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  104| [45] ["'1:49 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 12:  112| [47] [Ukita]
 13:  115| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '1:55 PM'."]
 14:  124| [47] [Ukita]
 15:  127| [45] ["'1:52 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 16:  135| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  138| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '1:58 PM'."]
 18:  147| [47] [Ukita]
 19:  150| [45] ["'1:55 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 20:  158| [47] [Ukita]
 21:  161| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '2:01 PM'."]
 22:  170| [47] [Ukita]
 23:  173| [45] ["'1:58 PM'. It seems you left the stairwell at this time--"]
 24:  181| [47] [Ukita]
 25:  184| [45] ["However, you did not return to the factory until '2:04 PM'."]
 26:  193| [47] [Watase]
 27:  196| [45] ["What!?"]
 28:  222| [47] [Jun]
 29:  225| [45] ["Mr. Ukita, is that true!?"]
 30:  251| [47] [Ukita]
 31:  254| [45] ["Yes, I checked my watch when he came back, so I'm sure of it."]
 32:  259| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Ukita did say,]
 33:  264| [45] ["You sure took quite some time. Did something happen?" when they regrouped in the factory.]
 34:  269| [45] [Watase had thought the time lag had been because he'd been shocked and out of it from finding a body, but--]
 35:  341| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  344| [45] ["There is no way that it takes six minutes to get from the inner ring to the factory."]
 37:  352| [47] [Ukita]
 38:  355| [45] ["Where were you and what were you doing in that six minute blank?"]
 39:  363| [47] [Watase]
 40:  366| [45] ["W-well... I was really out of it after seeing that body..."]
 41:  374| [47] [Watase]
 42:  377| [45] ["When I came to my senses, I was walking down the inner ring's hallway... but as for where and what I was doing..."]
 43:  403| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  406| [45] ["But that's not true. The archive footage even shows that there was no body in the first place!"]
 45:  421| [47] [Watase]
 46:  424| [45] ["No, I know what I saw...!"]
 47:  429| [45] [His memory of finding Yuuri's body was still crystal clear in Watase's mind.]
 48:  434| [45] [But his "subjective" memory had been smashed into pieces by Ukita's rebuttal-- and the "objective" video footage.]
 49:  460| [47] [Jun]
 50:  463| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this, Captain...?"]
 51:  489| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  492| [45] ["Do you even need to ask? I believe it is quite obvious: he was lying."]
 53:  518| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  521| [45] ["Ly...ing...?"]
 55:  529| [47] [Ukita]
 56:  532| [45] ["Right. He came back to the factory late on the excuse that he 'saw' a body that was never actually there."]
 57:  558| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  561| [45] ["He probably took that opportunity to steal the AD under our noses."]
 59:  575| [47] [Watase]
 60:  578| [45] ["...!"]
 61:  583| [45] [Watase instinctively fell quiet.]
 62:  588| [45] [His memory of finding the body was crystal clear-- but his "subjective" memory had been smashed into pieces by the "objective" video footage.]
 63:  614| [47] [Jun]
 64:  617| [45] ["Wh-what's the meaning of this, Captain... why would you ever lie like that?"]
 65:  643| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  646| [45] ["Why, you ask? I believe it is quite obvious."]
 67:  654| [47] [Ukita]
 68:  657| [45] ["He used that as an excuse to show up late to the factory..."]
 69:  683| [47] [Ukita]
 70:  686| [45] ["Then probably took that opportunity to steal the AD under our noses."]
 71:  778| [47] [All]
 72:  781| [45] ["!!"]
 73:  786| [45] [Everyone gasped at Ukita's accusation.]
 74:  794| [47] [Watase]
 75:  797| [45] ["N-no! I never did anything like that!"]
 76:  901| [47] [Ukita]
 77:  904| [45] ["Then what were you doing for six minutes? You knew we were in a race against time, yes?"]
 78:  912| [47] [Watase]
 79:  915| [45] ["..."]
 80:  920| [45] [Watase instinctively fell quiet, overwhelmed by confusion.]
 81:  947| [47] [Jun]
 82:  950| [45] ["What's wrong, Captain...? Say something..."]
 83:  976| [47] [Jun]
 84:  979| [45] ["Were you... were you lying to us...?"]
 85:  987| [47] [Watase]
 86:  990| [45] ["N-no..."]
 87:  998| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1001| [45] ["I swear that I don't know what happened..."]
 89: 1027| [47] [Ukita]
 90: 1030| [45] ["I see now, so you can't even trust yourself? So you're chalking all this up to your memory impairment. Very well, so be it."]
 91: 1056| [47] [Ukita]
 92: 1059| [45] ["But you know... that is also an admission that nothing you have said up until this point can be trusted."]
 93: 1067| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1070| [45] ["What...?"]
 95: 1078| [47] [Ukita]
 96: 1081| [45] ["When we were arguing over the disappearance of the AD earlier, you were the one who scolded us. You looked confident that you weren't the culprit."]
 97: 1107| [47] [Ukita]
 98: 1110| [45] ["But how are we supposed to trust the words of a man who hallucinated seeing a body?"]
 99: 1118| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1121| [45] ["Isn't it possible that you hid the AD somewhere and simply forgot about it?"]
101: 1129| [47] [Watase]
102: 1132| [45] ["Th-that's impossible! No chance in hell! I'm sane!"]
103: 1158| [47] [Ukita]
104: 1161| [45] ["Sane? Then that must mean you're a liar instead."]
105: 1169| [47] [Ukita]
106: 1172| [45] ["You lied about finding a body, and you're probably lying about not stealing the AD too."]
107: 1180| [47] [Watase]
108: 1183| [45] ["Ugh..."]
109: 1188| [45] [It was then that Watase realized it.]
110: 1193| [45] [Whether he was sane or not, it didn't change the fact that either way, his words were no longer trustworthy.]
111: 1219| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1222| [45] ["P-please wait... the question here is why he would ever tell such a bizarre lie like that..."]
113: 1248| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1251| [45] ["Who knows? But if you think of it that way, then that makes everything about him suspicious."]
115: 1277| [47] [Ukita]
116: 1280| [45] ["Like, for example-- were the memories that he claimed he 'got back' really true to begin with?"]
117: 1288| [47] [Watase]
118: 1291| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
119: 1299| [47] [Ukita]
120: 1302| [45] ["You claimed you went down to the basement to rescue survivors. But perhaps that's yet another lie--"]
121: 1310| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1313| [45] ["And in reality, you came down for a completely different purpose."]
123: 1321| [47] [Watase]
124: 1324| [45] ["Wh-what different purpose...?"]
125: 1350| [47] [Ukita]
126: 1353| [45] ["Isn't it obvious? To kill."]
127: 1361| [47] [Watase]
128: 1364| [45] ["!!"]
129: 1369| [45] [Watase gasped with shock. Ukita continued.]
130: 1377| [47] [Ukita]
131: 1380| [45] ["Yes, this was not an act of terrorism, but rather a systematic murder."]
132: 1406| [47] [Ukita]
133: 1409| [45] ["Take this theory for example: you wanted to kill your coworker 'Dojima' for some reason..."]
134: 1417| [47] [Ukita]
135: 1420| [45] ["So you decided to murder him during a dispatch to a disaster site."]
136: 1446| [47] [Ukita]
137: 1449| [45] ["If he died at a site with a particularly nasty fire, his corpse would have been burned up. Then his death would have been dismissed as an accident."]
138: 1457| [47] [Ukita]
139: 1460| [45] ["Once you came up with this scheme, you took this incident as the perfect opportunity to put your plan into motion."]
140: 1532| [47] [Ukita]
141: 1535| [45] ["But those two researchers witnessed what you'd done. So you killed them to silence them."]
142: 1543| [47] [Watase]
143: 1546| [45] ["...!"]
144: 1572| [47] [Ukita]
145: 1575| [45] ["Hiyama barely managed to escape, but in the end he got burned to death."]
146: 1601| [47] [Ukita]
147: 1604| [45] ["And if we think of it that way, then perhaps Yuuri and that girl who died by the lift... were also witnesses."]
148: 1630| [47] [Ukita]
149: 1633| [45] ["Oh, and that's right, Louise-- you know, the one who runs away from you every time she sees you-- may also be a witness."]
150: 1648| [47] [Watase]
151: 1651| [45] ["Stop already! That's all bullshit! Why the hell would I ever do any of that!?"]
152: 1677| [47] [Ukita]
153: 1680| [45] ["I don't have proof that you did it. But there's also no proof that you -didn't- do it."]
154: 1706| [47] [Ukita]
155: 1709| [45] ["That is something that you yourself have acknowledged repeatedly, yes?"]
156: 1717| [47] [Watase]
157: 1720| [45] ["Khh..."]
158: 1734| [47] [Watase]
159: 1737| [45] ["A-are you serious...? No way, that can't be true, can it...?!"]
160: 1763| [47] [Ukita]
161: 1766| [45] ["Oh? Does this mean that even you suspect that it's the truth?"]
162: 1774| [47] [Watase]
163: 1777| [45] ["...!"]
164: 1782| [45] [It had been for a second-- only a mere second-- but he had indeed suspected that.]
165: 1787| [47] [Watase]
166: 1788| [45] [(Th-that's right... now that I think about it, a lot of things were strange from the beginning.)]
167: 1793| [47] [Watase]
168: 1794| [45] [(The reason Salyu kept running away was because... she was running from -me-?)]
169: 1799| [47] [Watase]
170: 1800| [45] [(... No way... Is that true...?)]
171: 1844| [45] [Watase looked around, seeking help.]
172: 1849| [45] [He locked eyes with Kazami. A troubled look rose to her face.]
173: 1903| [47] [Watase]
174: 1906| [45] ["T-Tachibana... did I hate that Dojima guy... enough to kill him...?"]
175: 1932| [47] [Kazami]
176: 1935| [45] ["I-I don't know..."]
177: 1943| [47] [Watase]
178: 1946| [45] ["Then... do you at least know if I ever acted like I might...?"]
179: 1954| [47] [Kazami]
180: 1957| [45] ["I really don't know."]
181: 1992| [47] [Kazami]
182: 1995| [45] ["I don't know because you never once talked about yourself...!"]
183: 2000| [45] [Kazami looked at Watase with sad eyes.]
184: 2008| [47] [Watase]
185: 2011| [45] ["I never talked about myself...?"]
186: 2019| [47] [Kazami]
187: 2022| [45] ["No. Before you lost your memories, you were a man who put his distance between others..."]
188: 2030| [47] [Kazami]
189: 2033| [45] ["You never once told anyone what you were thinking, nor did you even attempt to. No one..."]
190: 2059| [47] [Kazami]
191: 2062| [45] ["... Not even me..."]
192: 2067| [45] [Kazami said that in a pained voice. Jun then spoke up.]
193: 2093| [47] [Jun]
194: 2096| [45] ["N-now that you mention it... I don't know anything about the Captain's private life either..."]
195: 2104| [47] [Jun]
196: 2107| [45] ["... I just know him on a work basis..."]
197: 2119| [45] [Those words sent blood rushing to Watase's head.]
198: 2127| [47] [Watase]
199: 2130| [45] ["Th-that can't be!"]
200: 2138| [47] [Watase]
201: 2141| [45] ["Dojima and I were your coworkers, right!? So how could you not know any--"]
202: 2146| [45] [But before Watase could say any more,]
203: 2172| [47] [Kazami]
204: 2175| [45] ["How could I possibly know when you never once talked about yourself!?"]
205: 2180| [45] [Kazami interjected with a stinging voice.]
206: 2188| [47] [Watase]
207: 2191| [45] ["...!!"]
208: 2196| [45] [Watase gasped. Kazami stared at him with dull eyes.]
209: 2222| [47] [Kazami]
210: 2225| [45] ["No. Before you lost your memories, you were a man who put his distance between others..."]
211: 2233| [47] [Kazami]
212: 2236| [45] ["You never once told anyone what you were thinking, nor did you even attempt to. No one..."]
213: 2244| [47] [Watase]
214: 2247| [45] ["I... I never talked about myself...?"]
215: 2273| [47] [Kazami]
216: 2276| [45] ["Yes... It was like..."]
217: 2302| [47] [Jun]
218: 2305| [45] ["... Like he had something to hide...!?"]
219: 2310| [45] [Jun finished the sentence that Kazami had bitterly begun weaving.]
220: 2318| [47] [Watase]
221: 2321| [45] ["... What would I want to hide?"]
222: 2326| [45] [Jun answered Watase's obvious question in a dry voice.]
223: 2352| [47] [Jun]
224: 2355| [45] ["Who knows...?"]
225: 2363| [47] [Watase]
226: 2366| [45] ["Hey... are you taking this seriously?"]
227: 2392| [47] [Jun]
228: 2395| [45] ["Well, it's just, now that I think about it... I don't know anything about your private life either."]
229: 2403| [47] [Jun]
230: 2406| [45] ["I just know you on a work basis..."]
231: 2453| [47] [Watase]
232: 2456| [45] ["..."]
233: 2461| [45] [Watase was astonished.]
234: 2466| [45] [He'd thought that Kazami and Jun would trust him.]
235: 2471| [45] [Just as he trusted them.]
236: 2476| [45] [Yet they didn't trust not only the Watase without his memories, but even the him from -when- he had his memories.]
237: 2481| [47] [Watase]
238: 2482| [45] [(This isn't happening...!)]
239: 2487| [45] [Watase's feet started shaking.]
240: 2492| [45] [Jun glared at him and spoke.]
241: 2518| [47] [Jun]
242: 2521| [45] ["Captain... tell us the truth..."]
243: 2529| [47] [Jun]
244: 2532| [45] ["Why did you really go down to the basement...?"]
245: 2540| [47] [Jun]
246: 2543| [45] ["You normally would have never left a command post to begin with, so why...?"]
247: 2569| [47] [Jun]
248: 2572| [45] ["Come on, tell me..."]
249: 2580| [47] [Jun]
250: 2583| [45] ["Captain... did you really come here to save lives...?"]
251: 2609| [47] [Jun]
252: 2612| [45] ["If you didn't..."]
253: 2620| [47] [Jun]
254: 2623| [45] ["Then I swear I'll make you pay, you hear...?"]
255: 2628| [45] [Anger was slowly building in Jun's eyes.]
256: 2633| [45] [No, it wasn't as simple as anger.]
257: 2638| [45] [--It was the intent to kill.]
258: 2643| [45] [Jun glared at Watase with bloodthirsty eyes.]
259: 2651| [47] [Watase]
260: 2654| [45] ["No, you're wr..."]
261: 2659| [45] [He wanted to say she was wrong, but he couldn't.]
262: 2664| [45] [He knew anything he said here would sound hollow.]
263: 2723| [45] [Yet he tried to say something-- but just then...]
264: 2810| [47] [Ena]
265: 2813| [45] ["Hold on, you two."]
266: 2818| [45] [Ena spoke up.]
267: 2886| [47] [Jun]
268: 2889| [45] ["... What?"]
269: 2897| [47] [Ena]
270: 2900| [45] ["You guys are acting a little weird."]
271: 2926| [47] [Jun]
272: 2929| [45] ["Huh? How so?"]
273: 2957| [47] [Ukita]
274: 2960| [45] ["Indeed. I believe we have made a truly sound argument."]
275: 2986| [47] [Ena]
276: 2989| [45] ["Nothing about this is 'sound'. Didn't Captain Kasasagi risk his life on multiple occasions to save you guys?"]
277: 2997| [47] [Ena]
278: 3000| [45] ["And yet you turned your backs on him the moment the AD disappeared?%NWhat kind of sane person does that?"]
279: 3026| [47] [Jun]
280: 3029| [45] ["That has nothing to do with this."]
281: 3037| [47] [Jun]
282: 3040| [45] ["Why are -you- on the Captain's side after hearing everything we've just said? I mean, you barely know the guy, right?"]
283: 3066| [47] [Jun]
284: 3069| [45] ["Unless... the two of you are in cahoots or something?"]
285: 3095| [47] [Ena]
286: 3098| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about!?"]
287: 3103| [45] [That sudden accusation left Ena with a confused look on her face.]
288: 3108| [45] [But Ukita kept up the assault before she had time to counter.]
289: 3134| [47] [Ukita]
290: 3137| [45] ["I see, now I get it. I always did think you were acting strange...!"]
291: 3163| [47] [Ukita]
292: 3166| [45] ["Now I finally understand! You two are planning to just save yourselves and leave the rest of us to die!"]
293: 3174| [47] [Ukita]
294: 3177| [45] ["You were the ones who hid the AD, weren't you!? All so you could have it all to yourselves!"]
295: 3244| [45] [Ukita and Jun were glaring at Watase and Ena.]
296: 3249| [45] [It was then that Watase finally realized it:]
297: 3333| [45] [Their eyes were full of madness.]
298: 3397| [47] [Watase]
299: 3398| [45] [(Th-this isn't good... they really are out of their minds...!)]
300: 3403| [45] [Now that he thought about it, there were numerous factors that could be behind it.]
301: 3408| [45] [Their hours of built-up fatigue.]
302: 3413| [45] [The multiple strange happenings in this place.]
303: 3418| [45] [The feeling of entrapment from being stuck down here.]
304: 3423| [45] [The despair at not finding an exit.]
305: 3428| [45] [The fear from finding all those bodies.]
306: 3433| [45] [And then--]
307: 3438| [45] [The loss of the AD had driven the final nail in the coffin.]
308: 3443| [45] [That one act had dramatically shortened the group's lifespan.]
309: 3448| [47] [Watase]
310: 3449| [45] [(It's impossible to expect anyone to remain sane in these circumstances...!)]
311: 3454| [45] [Ukita and Jun prowled towards them.]
312: 3459| [45] [Just then, a voice echoed in Watase's head.]
313: 3517| [85] [{It's too dangerous... take Prof. Tsubakiyama and run!}]
314: 3518| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
315: 3519| [86] [{It's too dangerous... take Prof. Tsubakiyama and run!}]
316: 3622| [47] [Watase]
317: 3625| [45] ["!"]
318: 3630| [45] [Watase came back to his senses and took Ena by the arm.]
319: 3635| [45] [But at that moment--]
320: 3728| [47] [Jun]
321: 3731| [45] ["Trying to run!?"]
322: 3739| [47] [Ukita]
323: 3742| [45] ["Not good! Hold them down!"]
324: 3747| [45] [Jun and Ukita sprung at them.]
325: 3752| [45] [But Watase and Ena barely managed to dodge them in time.]
326: 3809| [47] [Jun]
327: 3812| [45] ["Agh!"]
328: 3820| [47] [Ukita]
329: 3823| [45] ["Ghh!"]
330: 3871| [45] [Jun and Ukita slammed into the monitors.]
331: 3933| [45] [But they quickly turned around and glared at Watase and Ena.]
332: 4013| [47] [Watase]
333: 4016| [45] ["...!"]
334: 4021| [45] [Watase instinctively looked away, only for his eyes to turn to Kazami.]
335: 4044| [47] [Kazami]
336: 4045| [45] ["--"]
337: 4050| [45] [Kazami was looking towards the exit. She then gave Watase a glance as if to say "run".]
338: 4077| [47] [Watase]
339: 4080| [45] ["Teach, let's get out of here!"]
340: 4088| [47] [Ena]
341: 4091| [45] ["R-right!"]
342: 4096| [45] [Watase took Ena's arm and ran out of the room.]
