  0:   66| [45] [--After they reunited with Watase in Area 1--]
  1:   71| [45] [Kazami and the others saved "Yuuri", a civilian who got caught up in the accident--]
  2:  116| [45] [But then Watase said something bizarre just afterwards.]
  3:  210| [47] [Watase]
  4:  213| [45] ["You've been calling me 'Captain'... so does that mean I'm the captain of a rescue squad or something?"]
  5:  218| [47] [Kazami]
  6:  221| [45] ["What... do you mean by that?"]
  7:  249| [47] [Watase]
  8:  252| [45] ["Well, the thing is... I don't know anything."]
  9:  260| [47] [Watase]
 10:  263| [45] ["Not who I am, or even where I am..."]
 11:  268| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  271| [45] ["Y-you don't mean..."]
 13:  324| [47] [Jun]
 14:  327| [45] ["You've got amnesia...?"]
 15:  381| [47] [Watase]
 16:  384| [45] ["... Y-yeah... I guess you -would- call this amnesia..."]
 17:  389| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  390| [45] [(That can't be--!)]
 19:  395| [45] [Kazami was doubtful for a second, but--]
 20:  407| [45] [First, she asked what was most urgent to confirm.]
 21:  412| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  415| [45] ["P-please hold on a moment, Captain! Did you hurt your head by any chance!?"]
 23:  423| [47] [Watase]
 24:  426| [45] ["My head...? Now that you mention it, I did have this really bad headache a few minutes ago..."]
 25:  431| [45] [Fear and relief mixed in Kazami's heart when she heard that.]
 26:  436| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  439| [45] ["I knew it...! There's a possibility that you hit your head on something."]
 28:  444| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  447| [45] ["That's probably why you're feeling so dazed and having trouble remembering things.%NThen that means your memories should return in time."]
 30:  473| [47] [Watase]
 31:  476| [45] ["I-is that how it works?"]
 32:  481| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  484| [45] ["Yes. It appears that retrograde amnesia caused by physical trauma goes away fairly quickly on its own without requiring any particular treatment in most cases."]
 34:  510| [47] [Watase]
 35:  513| [45] ["... Then you're saying this is only temporary?"]
 36:  518| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  521| [45] ["Yes. But if you suffered brain damage by any chance, it's possible that your amnesia could be permanent."]
 38:  574| [47] [Jun]
 39:  577| [45] ["What the hell? That's horrible...!"]
 40:  603| [47] [Jun]
 41:  606| [45] ["Captain, how bad is your headache? Do you feel like throwing up?"]
 42:  660| [47] [Watase]
 43:  663| [45] ["No... my head doesn't hurt at all right now, and my stomach feels fine."]
 44:  668| [45] [Kazami felt a twinge of relief from those words.]
 45:  673| [47] [Kazami]
 46:  674| [45] [(But though it may be temporary, it doesn't change the fact that he's in a bad spot!)]
 47:  679| [47] [Kazami]
 48:  680| [45] [(I must give him my support!)]
 49:  685| [45] [Kazami focused her mind on the new, prevalent issue at hand.]
 50:  836| [45] [--At any rate, Kazami decided to put Watase's safety first and told him to wait behind in the makeshift base.]
 51:  841| [45] [But he refused to accept that proposal.]
 52:  867| [47] [Watase]
 53:  870| [45] ["Let me help out with rescuing any other survivors!"]
 54:  875| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  878| [45] ["Huh? But--"]
 56:  904| [47] [Watase]
 57:  907| [45] ["But that doesn't change that I'm still a rescue worker, right? So I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I just sat on the sidelines while you're all still hard at work."]
 58:  912| [45] [Hearing that made Kazami a little happy.]
 59:  917| [45] [For despite his amnesia, Watase still had the heart of a rescue worker.]
 60:  922| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  925| [45] ["... Sheesh, some things just never change..."]
 62:  930| [45] [--But one could not survive this line of work with passion alone.]
 63:  935| [45] [So Kazami decided to act more strictly than usual to try and protect Watase, Jun, and Yuuri.]
 64:  940| [47] [Kazami]
 65:  943| [45] ["This is no ordinary mission. So if you want to stay with us as a rescue worker, then you must be prepared to accept the responsibilities and duties that come with it."]
 66:  969| [47] [Watase]
 67:  972| [45] ["...!"]
 68:  977| [47] [Kazami]
 69:  980| [45] ["You will be treated as a new recruit until you regain your memory. I ask that you follow my orders just as Moribe does."]
 70:  985| [47] [Kazami]
 71:  988| [45] ["I know this is a severe violation of my station, but trust me when I say your life could be in grave danger if you don't do as I say... Please try to understand."]
 72: 1016| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1019| [45] ["Y... yeah, roger that!"]
 74: 1024| [45] [Kazami silently encouraged Watase when she heard that.]
 75: 1029| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1030| [45] [(Please don't push yourself...!)]
