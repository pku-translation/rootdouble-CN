  2:   59| [45] [----]
  3:   64| [45] [--]
  4:  168| [47] [Automatic PA]
  5:  171| [45] ["--... Emergency power supply has hit operational limit."]
  6:  176| [45] [--How long had he been passed out for?]
  7:  181| [47] [Automatic PA]
  8:  184| [45] ["Now switching to uninterruptible power system--..."]
  9:  192| [47] [Watase]
 10:  195| [45] ["--... U-ugh...!"]
 11:  200| [45] [Watase woke up to the sound of an emotionless, artificial voice.]
 12:  254| [45] [He sat up and looked around to find his surroundings buried in darkness.]
 13:  262| [47] [Watase]
 14:  265| [45] ["... What's going on...? Was there a blackout?"]
 15:  270| [45] [Watase shook his throbbing head and glanced at his watch.]
 16:  281| [45] [The time displayed on the faintly glowing LCD was "5:50 PM".]
 17:  286| [45] [It appeared he'd been unconscious for two and a half hours.]
 18:  294| [47] [Watase]
 19:  297| [45] ["What am I... doing here...?"]
 20:  302| [45] [He remembered everything up to getting hit in the back of the head and passing out.]
 21:  307| [45] [And that it was Jun who'd been responsible for that.]
 22:  312| [45] [His blurry thoughts then soon gradually became clearer and clearer again--]
 23:  439| [47] [Jun]
 24:  442| [45] ["So don't worry... I'll make sure you don't have to stain your hands in this..."]
 25:  450| [47] [Jun]
 26:  453| [45] ["It pains me to do this..."]
 27:  461| [47] [Jun]
 28:  464| [45] ["... but I'll be sure to kill Mr. Ukita..."]
 29:  532| [47] [Watase]
 30:  533| [45] [(That's right... and that sound I heard right after that...)]
 31:  635| [47] [Watase]
 32:  638| [45] ["It was the engine cutter...!"]
 33:  646| [47] [Watase]
 34:  649| [45] ["Why did I hear something like that back then...?"]
 35:  657| [47] [Watase]
 36:  660| [45] ["Oh no--!"]
 37:  668| [47] [Watase]
 38:  671| [45] ["Don't tell me she went to kill the old man with something like that!?"]
 39:  676| [45] [Terror overcame Watase when he made that connection.]
 40:  681| [45] [He then felt a pain in his side.]
 41:  686| [45] [He looked there to find blood oozing down.]
 42:  691| [45] [It was the bullet wound he'd gotten from Ukita.]
 43:  699| [47] [Watase]
 44:  702| [45] ["Moribe, you dumbass! The old man has a gun!"]
 45:  707| [45] [A pistol versus an engine cutter--]
 46:  712| [45] [Jun was at an overwhelming disadvantage no matter how one spun it.]
 47:  717| [45] [Watase looked to the side to find the pistol he'd picked up in Area N lying there.]
 48:  725| [47] [Watase]
 49:  728| [45] ["Goddammit..."]
 50:  733| [45] [But it was out of bullets. Now Watase had no weapons.]
 51:  738| [45] [His head was still swaying from Jun's blow.]
 52:  743| [47] [Watase]
 53:  744| [45] [(But if I leave things the way they are now, then Moribe will also...!)]
 54:  749| [45] [He didn't want to see any more deaths. Not his comrades, nor any innocent people.]
 55:  754| [45] [Watase put a hand against the wall and stood up--]
 56:  759| [45] [Then started walking as though he were dragging his body along.]
 57:  803| [45] [--He soon found himself approaching a connecting passageway...]
 58:  808| [45] [When all of a sudden, he noticed something lying in front of him.]
 59:  816| [47] [Watase]
 60:  819| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 61:  824| [45] [Watase studied it carefully as his nose was assaulted by a stench akin to rusted iron.]
 62:  829| [47] [Watase]
 63:  830| [45] [(...!)]
 64:  842| [45] [--The stench of blood.]
 65:  847| [45] [Watase felt shivers run down his spine as he realized that the air around him was saturated with it.]
 66:  852| [47] [Watase]
 67:  853| [45] [(... It can't be...!?)]
 68:  904| [45] [Watase cautiously approached the object.]
 69:  909| [45] [He could make out more and more of its features the closer he got.]
 70:  914| [45] [The thing he'd spotted lying in the middle of the hallway--]
 71:  919| [45] [Was a small woman wearing a rescue worker uniform.]
 72:  927| [47] [Watase]
 73:  930| [45] ["M-Moribe...?"]
 74:  935| [45] [Watase staggered over to her and held her in his arms.]
 75: 1045| [45] [His arms were soaked with something slippery when he did.]
 76: 1053| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1056| [45] ["H... hey..."]
 78: 1061| [45] [Watase called out to Jun in an unbearably shaky voice.]
 79: 1066| [45] [But she didn't answer him.]
 80: 1071| [45] [Memories of Jun then flickered through Watase's head at that moment.]
 81: 1161| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1164| [45] ["And I'm 'Jun Moribe', Firefighter, 20 years old! I only just joined Sirus this year, so I'm whatcha'd call the team's 'new blood'!"]
 83: 1190| [47] [Jun]
 84: 1193| [45] ["My nickname's 'Sirius' Lady Suicide Squad Chief'! My catchphrase is 'Jun's my name, rescue's my game!' Let's get along, okay!?"]
 85: 1270| [47] [Jun]
 86: 1273| [45] ["I'll remove the grate and go to the other side!"]
 87: 1281| [47] [Jun]
 88: 1284| [45] ["My body's smaller than the Captain's, so I'm better suited for this role!"]
 89: 1361| [47] [Jun]
 90: 1364| [45] ["... Okay then. If you're going, then I'm coming too."]
 91: 1390| [47] [Jun]
 92: 1393| [45] ["Are you listening to yourself!? It's more dangerous for you to go alone, right?!"]
 93: 1489| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1492| [45] ["--Stop! Dammit, don't jinx me like that!"]
 95: 1500| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1503| [45] ["I can't let Moribe die!"]
 97: 1508| [45] [Watase shouted that as he searched Moribe's body for wounds.]
 98: 1513| [45] [He wanted to see if there was any chance she was still alive.]
 99: 1518| [45] [But there were three holes burrowed into her body.]
100: 1523| [45] [The first was through the right shoulder, the second was in the abdomen, and the third was right in the center of her chest.]
101: 1528| [45] [Blood was gushing out of every last one of them.]
102: 1533| [45] [Watase's gloves were already soaked to their core.]
103: 1580| [47] [Watase]
104: 1583| [45] ["What the hell is this...? I-is this a bad joke...?"]
105: 1591| [47] [Watase]
106: 1594| [45] ["Hey, c'mon, Moribe... Cut it out already and answer me, you hear...?"]
107: 1602| [47] [Watase]
108: 1605| [45] ["Hey, come on..."]
109: 1610| [45] [Watase shook Jun's body.]
110: 1615| [45] [But she never answered him.]
111: 1661| [47] [Watase]
112: 1664| [45] ["Khh--..."]
113: 1669| [45] [Jun had probably gone up against Ukita and lost.]
114: 1674| [45] [The engine cutter truly had been no match for a pistol in the end.]
115: 1682| [47] [Watase]
116: 1685| [45] ["Dammit... this is why..."]
117: 1693| [47] [Watase]
118: 1696| [45] ["--This is why I should have finished off the old man when I had the chance!"]
119: 1701| [45] [But it was too late for regrets.]
120: 1810| [45] [Ukita's face, brimming with madness, flashed through the darkness.]
121: 1857| [47] [Watase]
122: 1860| [45] ["... this time."]
123: 1868| [47] [Watase]
124: 1871| [45] ["I'll kill that bastard for sure this time...!"]
125: 1876| [45] [Watase broke out into a mad dash with a feral roar.]
126: 1919| [45] [But when he made it out of the connecting passageway--]
127: 1966| [47] [Watase]
128: 1969| [45] ["!?"]
129: 2077| [45] [He found Ukita sitting there, dead with blood pouring from his head.]
130: 2085| [47] [Watase]
131: 2088| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
132: 2093| [45] [Watase was rendered speechless by that abrupt anticlimax.]
133: 2098| [45] [A bloody piece of debris was lying next to his corpse.]
134: 2103| [45] [He'd probably died after being hit in the head by it.]
135: 2151| [47] [Watase]
136: 2154| [45] ["H... huh?"]
137: 2162| [47] [Watase]
138: 2165| [45] ["I-if the old man died here, then that means...!"]
139: 2170| [45] [That meant the only other people still alive in this place aside from Watase were Kazami and "Mashiro Toba".]
140: 2175| [47] [Watase]
141: 2176| [45] [(Wh-who did it... Was the old man killed by Tachibana, or by Mashiro Toba?)]
142: 2181| [45] [He couldn't see Mashiro Toba anywhere, and he didn't know a thing about her.%NThat was the way it'd always been.]
143: 2186| [45] [Which meant that the only suspect he really had was Kazami, but--]
144: 2191| [47] [Watase]
145: 2192| [45] [(It couldn't be Tachibana... not in a million years. I mean, she didn't even have a motive to kill the old man...)]
146: 2197| [47] [Watase]
147: 2198| [45] [(...!?)]
148: 2243| [45] [But just as that thought had hit him, something suddenly flashed through his head.]
149: 2248| [47] [Watase]
150: 2249| [45] [(No, hold on... if Tachibana witnessed the old man killing Moribe--!)]
151: 2254| [45] [Jun was like a sister to Kazami.]
152: 2259| [45] [If Ukita shot Jun dead right in front of her, it wouldn't be all that implausible for Kazami to want to kill him.]
153: 2264| [45] [Watase looked down coldly on Ukita's body, then spat out his next words in a hateful voice.]
154: 2272| [47] [Watase]
155: 2275| [45] ["... You reaped what you sowed."]
156: 2280| [45] [But the moment he said that--]
157: 2406| [45] [He felt like Salyu was staring at him from the beyond the darkness.]
158: 2411| [45] [Watase turned to her phantom and spoke.]
159: 2419| [47] [Watase]
160: 2422| [45] ["Yeah, I know... I'm just as guilty as he is..."]
161: 2427| [45] [Watase turned around and started to walk away from Ukita's body--]
162: 2453| [45] [Only to stumble over something.]
163: 2461| [47] [Watase]
164: 2464| [45] ["..."]
165: 2508| [45] [He could make out a silhouette in the darkness. Ukita was clutching the engine cutter in his hand.]
166: 2513| [45] [But that didn't make sense.]
167: 2518| [45] [That had been Jun's weapon of choice.]
168: 2526| [47] [Watase]
169: 2529| [45] ["What was the old man doing with it...!?"]
170: 2534| [45] [A bad feeling started worming its way into Watase's head.]
171: 2539| [45] [As far as he knew, Ukita had shot three people: Ena, Watase, and Jun.]
172: 2544| [45] [Meaning there was a plausible possibility he had run out of bullets after finishing Jun off.]
173: 2552| [47] [Watase]
174: 2555| [45] ["Then that means the old man must have taken the engine cutter from Moribe and...!"]
175: 2569| [45] [Watase crouched down and touched the engine cutter.]
176: 2577| [47] [Watase]
177: 2580| [45] ["...!"]
178: 2585| [45] [The blade was covered with something wet.]
179: 2590| [45] [It was a slimy liquid that had a unique stickiness to it.]
180: 2595| [45] [Watase took a deep breath and took out his PDA.]
181: 2708| [45] [He used the LCD's dim light to examine the engine cutter's blade.]
182: 2716| [47] [Watase]
183: 2719| [45] ["Aah... Aaaah..."]
184: 2724| [45] [Watase's breath shook.]
185: 2729| [45] [It was just as he'd feared-- the blade was indeed painted with blood.]
186: 2737| [47] [Watase]
187: 2740| [45] ["No... Tachibana, not you too...!?"]
188: 2745| [45] [Watase panicked as he used his PDA's light to illuminate the floor of the passageway.]
189: 2750| [45] [It had to be there. He just knew it.]
190: 2761| [45] [--He found it.]
191: 2766| [45] [There was a line of blood drops there.]
192: 2771| [45] [Almost as if they were her footprints.]
193: 2779| [47] [Watase]
194: 2782| [45] ["--Tachibana!"]
195: 2787| [45] [Watase ran through the hallway as he followed the blood trail.]
196: 2888| [45] [It just kept going on and on.]
197: 2932| [45] [Watase had no clue where she was heading.]
198: 2976| [45] [It just looked like she was wandering aimlessly, according to her footprints.]
199: 3020| [45] [Watase found himself praying as he followed them.]
200: 3064| [47] [Watase]
201: 3065| [45] [(Tachibana! Please, I'm begging you... please be okay!)]
202: 3110| [45] [He then arrived at B2 of Area 2's inner ring--]
203: 3115| [45] [Only to find Kazami collapsed in the middle of the dark hallway.]
204: 3123| [47] [Watase]
205: 3126| [45] ["Tachibana!"]
206: 3131| [45] [Watase ran over to her and held her in his arms.]
207: 3136| [45] [There was a giant laceration in her chest. Her body was still warm.]
208: 3144| [47] [Watase]
209: 3147| [45] ["Tachibana! Hang in there! Tachibana!"]
210: 3155| [47] [Kazami]
211: 3158| [45] ["Ugh..."]
212: 3292| [47] [Kazami]
213: 3295| [45] ["Ca... Capt... ain...?"]
214: 3303| [47] [Watase]
215: 3306| [45] ["Tachibana...!"]
216: 3314| [47] [Watase]
217: 3317| [45] ["It's okay, don't worry! I'll take you to the infirmary right away, you hear!?"]
218: 3322| [45] [Watase said that and tried to lift Kazami up.]
219: 3327| [45] [But she just shook her head in refusal--]
220: 3335| [47] [Kazami]
221: 3338| [45] ["Captain, please wait..."]
222: 3346| [47] [Watase]
223: 3349| [45] ["You dumbass! Don't talk! You'll just make your injuries worse!"]
224: 3357| [47] [Kazami]
225: 3360| [45] ["Pl... please... there's something... I have... to ask you..."]
226: 3368| [47] [Kazami]
227: 3371| [45] ["That's why... I was... looking for you... this whole time..."]
228: 3379| [47] [Watase]
229: 3382| [45] ["I know! I know that! If you want to ask me something, then ask anything you want later, okay!?"]
230: 3390| [47] [Watase]
231: 3393| [45] ["So let's just--"]
232: 3398| [45] [Watase was pleading to her.]
233: 3403| [45] [He could feel Kazami's body grow colder with every word she spoke.]
234: 3408| [45] [Yet she continued to talk to him with trembling lips.]
235: 3416| [47] [Kazami]
236: 3419| [45] ["Captain, please tell me..."]
237: 3427| [47] [Kazami]
238: 3430| [45] ["What... what in the world have we gotten ourselves mixed up in...?"]
239: 3438| [47] [Watase]
240: 3441| [45] ["I don't know. I wouldn't--"]
241: 3449| [47] [Kazami]
242: 3452| [45] ["Captain... please... stop... lying..."]
243: 3460| [47] [Kazami]
244: 3463| [45] ["Mr. Ukita said... that you were... behind all this..."]
245: 3471| [47] [Watase]
246: 3474| [45] ["...!?"]
247: 3482| [47] [Kazami]
248: 3485| [45] ["So please tell me... why did this... have to happen to us...?"]
249: 3493| [47] [Watase]
250: 3496| [45] ["H-hold on..."]
251: 3504| [47] [Watase]
252: 3507| [45] ["Why would I be the one behind all this...!?"]
253: 3515| [47] [Watase]
254: 3518| [45] ["I'm just a rescue squad captain, right!?"]
255: 3526| [47] [Watase]
256: 3529| [45] ["Weren't you the one who told me that...?"]
257: 3537| [47] [Watase]
258: 3540| [45] ["That's why I... wanted to be as close as I could to the 'Watase Kasasagi' that you know..."]
259: 3548| [47] [Watase]
260: 3551| [45] ["So why are you..."]
261: 3559| [47] [Kazami]
262: 3562| [45] ["Yes, but..."]
263: 3570| [47] [Kazami]
264: 3573| [45] ["In that case... why... did you lie back then...?"]
265: 3581| [47] [Watase]
266: 3584| [45] ["You're wrong! I never lied about anything!"]
267: 3592| [47] [Watase]
268: 3595| [45] ["Not a single time since I've woken up--"]
269: 3603| [47] [Kazami]
270: 3606| [45] ["Watase... I don't... understand you..."]
271: 3614| [47] [Kazami]
272: 3617| [45] ["No... I never have... not since back then..."]
273: 3625| [47] [Watase]
274: 3628| [45] ["That's enough! Please stop! Don't talk any more! I'm begging you!"]
275: 3633| [45] [He suddenly realized that Kazami's body had grown much colder.]
276: 3638| [45] [He could feel as much through his gloves.]
277: 3646| [47] [Kazami]
278: 3649| [45] ["Hey... please..."]
279: 3657| [47] [Kazami]
280: 3660| [45] ["Answer me... Watase..."]
281: 3665| [45] [Kazami's breath grew faint.]
282: 3670| [45] [The light was fading from her eyes.]
283: 3678| [47] [Watase]
284: 3681| [45] ["H-hey... T-Tachibana...?"]
285: 3689| [47] [Kazami]
286: 3692| [45] ["Wata... se...?"]
287: 3700| [47] [Kazami]
288: 3703| [45] ["Watase... I'm so..."]
289: 3711| [47] [Kazami]
290: 3714| [45] ["... cold..."]
291: 3719| [45] [Kazami muttered that in a shaky voice...]
292: 3764| [45] [--And then closed her eyes.]
293: 3769| [45] [Kazami quietly breathed her last in Watase's arms.]
294: 3774| [45] [Silence once again filled the darkness.]
295: 3779| [47] [Watase]
296: 3780| [45] ["..."]
297: 3785| [45] [Watase stared at Kazami's now lifeless face dumbfoundedly.]
298: 3790| [45] [Without anything to vent it out on, rage welled up from the pit of his stomach.]
299: 3838| [47] [Watase]
300: 3841| [45] ["... aah... Aaah..."]
301: 3849| [47] [Watase]
302: 3852| [45] ["... Uwooooh..."]
303: 3860| [47] [Watase]
304: 3863| [45] ["... OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!"]
305: 3871| [47] [Watase]
306: 3874| [45] ["Why!? Why the hell did this happen!?"]
307: 3882| [47] [Watase]
308: 3885| [45] ["Tell me, Tachibana!"]
309: 3893| [47] [Watase]
310: 3896| [45] ["What did you mean when you said I'm behind all this!?"]
311: 3904| [47] [Watase]
312: 3907| [45] ["Was it my fault!?"]
313: 3915| [47] [Watase]
314: 3918| [45] ["Are you saying that it's all my fault everyone's dead!?"]
315: 3961| [45] [But Watase's cries were devoured by the darkness.]
316: 3966| [45] [No answer came to him.]
317: 3974| [47] [Watase]
318: 3977| [45] ["Khh..."]
319: 3982| [45] [It was at that moment that something decisive snapped within Watase.]
320: 3987| [45] [The whole situation was so bizarrely humorous that he couldn't help but laugh.]
321: 3995| [47] [Watase]
322: 3998| [45] ["Heheheh..."]
323: 4006| [47] [Watase]
324: 4009| [45] ["Heheheheheheh..."]
325: 4017| [47] [Watase]
326: 4020| [45] ["--AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"]
327: 4028| [47] [Watase]
328: 4031| [45] ["I get it! It all makes sense now! It's just as Tachibana said!"]
329: 4039| [47] [Watase]
330: 4042| [45] ["I really did kill everyone!"]
331: 4107| [47] [Watase]
332: 4110| [45] ["And those guys too--"]
333: 4173| [47] [Watase]
334: 4176| [45] ["And him too--"]
335: 4239| [47] [Watase]
336: 4242| [45] ["And that girl too--"]
337: 4305| [47] [Watase]
338: 4308| [45] ["That's it! I must have killed Yuuri after she suddenly disappeared too!"]
339: 4316| [47] [Watase]
340: 4319| [45] ["That memory was just a fragment of the time I did it, that's what!"]
341: 4382| [47] [Watase]
342: 4385| [45] ["That's not all. Then there was that boy too--"]
343: 4448| [47] [Watase]
344: 4451| [45] ["Then Salyu--"]
345: 4513| [47] [Watase]
346: 4516| [45] ["And Teach, Moribe, the old man, and even you, Tachibana--"]
347: 4524| [47] [Watase]
348: 4527| [45] ["Of course! I must have killed everyone with my own hands! That has to be it!"]
349: 4532| [45] [Watase looked at his gloves to find they were stained dark red with blood.]
350: 4537| [45] [It wasn't just there-- his entire uniform was splattered with the blood of others.]
351: 4545| [47] [Watase]
352: 4548| [45] ["Ha ha... yes, I'm sure, that's gotta be it..."]
353: 4556| [47] [Watase]
354: 4559| [45] ["I just forgot about killing everyone and rewrote all those memories with fake ones that made me look good--"]
355: 4567| [47] [Watase]
356: 4570| [45] ["I'm a murderer who set fire to LABO, blew it up, and killed everyone who got trapped by the lockdown!"]
357: 4575| [45] [Watase then looked at Kazami's face one more time.]
358: 4623| [47] [Watase]
359: 4626| [45] ["Hey, isn't that right, Tachibana?"]
360: 4634| [47] [Watase]
361: 4637| [45] ["That had to be what you meant when you said I was behind all this, right?"]
362: 4645| [47] [Watase]
363: 4648| [45] ["Right, Tachibana...?"]
364: 4656| [47] [Watase]
365: 4659| [45] ["Right...?"]
366: 4664| [47] [Watase]
367: 4665| [45] ["..."]
368: 4670| [47] [Watase]
369: 4671| [45] ["..."]
370: 4676| [47] [Watase]
371: 4677| [45] ["..."]
372: 4685| [47] [Watase]
373: 4688| [45] ["Hey, come on, Tachibana...!"]
374: 4696| [47] [Watase]
375: 4699| [45] ["I'm begging you... call me 'Captain' again one more time...!"]
376: 4742| [45] [But Kazami's eyes remained shut--]
377: 4747| [45] [Leaving Watase's wish to be swallowed into the darkness.]
378: 4791| [45] [... After that, Watase blindly wandered all around LABO.]
379: 4835| [45] [He searched for "Mashiro Toba", the only survivor who hadn't been found.]
380: 4879| [45] [Was he a rescue worker, or a killer--?]
381: 4923| [45] [He planned to find the answer to that question by locating her and watching her reaction to him.]
382: 4967| [45] [A sudden question came to him as he continued prowling about.]
383: 5011| [45] [If all of LABO was supposed to be a contaminated zone by now--]
384: 5055| [45] [--then why wasn't he feeling any pain at all?]
385: 5099| [45] [But that question soon meant nothing to him.]
386: 5143| [45] [In the end, no matter how hard he searched the place--]
387: 5186| [45] [Watase never found the "9th survivor".]
