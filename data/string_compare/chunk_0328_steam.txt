  1:  107| [47] [Watase]
  2:  110| [45] ["--Teach, put the gun down..."]
  3:  115| [45] [Watase called out to her in a subdued voice.]
  4:  120| [45] [He had to get back to the shelter as soon as possible. He couldn't have Ena holding him up.]
  5:  125| [45] [She kept her gun trained on him and answered.]
  6:  133| [47] [Ena]
  7:  136| [45] ["I can't do that...!"]
  8:  144| [47] [Ena]
  9:  147| [45] ["Mr. Ukita told me that you're a terrorist."]
 10:  155| [47] [Watase]
 11:  158| [45] ["..."]
 12:  166| [47] [Ena]
 13:  169| [45] ["You're not denying it?"]
 14:  177| [47] [Watase]
 15:  180| [45] ["... I can't. It's the truth, after all."]
 16:  188| [47] [Watase]
 17:  191| [45] ["I've been plotting an attack on LABO for a year now. I remembered that after I got all my memories back."]
 18:  199| [47] [Ena]
 19:  202| [45] ["Then are you really a rescue worker?"]
 20:  210| [47] [Watase]
 21:  213| [45] ["Yeah, I am... Hilarious, isn't it? I was partaking in a terrorist plot while working to save lives..."]
 22:  221| [47] [Ena]
 23:  224| [45] ["It's not funny... not at all."]
 24:  229| [45] [A lonely smile then formed on Ena's face.]
 25:  237| [47] [Ena]
 26:  240| [45] ["... I was hoping that Mr. Ukita was lying."]
 27:  298| [47] [Ena]
 28:  301| [45] ["I figured you couldn't be a terrorist. I thought you were a true rescue worker who risked his life to save others."]
 29:  309| [47] [Ena]
 30:  312| [45] ["The 'Captain Kasasagi' I knew well... was a man who would run through contaminated zones and poisonous gas to save others."]
 31:  317| [47] [Watase]
 32:  318| [45] ["..."]
 33:  336| [47] [Ena]
 34:  339| [45] ["... Why did you do all this? Why terrorism?"]
 35:  344| [45] [Watase's heart ached at that question.]
 36:  349| [45] [He didn't have long to talk. However--]
 37:  354| [45] [He felt that he had to tell her the truth in order to get her to lower her gun.]
 38:  412| [47] [Watase]
 39:  415| [45] ["... You see, I lost my family in a fire 16 years ago."]
 40:  423| [47] [Ena]
 41:  426| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 42:  434| [47] [Watase]
 43:  437| [45] ["Back then, I just felt sad. But it wasn't until many years later that I learned the truth."]
 44:  490| [47] [Watase]
 45:  493| [45] ["Teach, did you know that fire was caused by a single Communicator?"]
 46:  501| [47] [Watase]
 47:  504| [45] ["But the ones behind Rokumei City and LABO covered all that up..."]
 48:  509| [45] [There were very few who knew that truth.]
 49:  514| [45] [The only ones who did were Q, the affected individuals-- and the Rokumei City government.]
 50:  519| [45] [Ena listened to him all the way through, then quietly answered.]
 51:  537| [47] [Ena]
 52:  540| [45] ["... I knew."]
 53:  548| [47] [Watase]
 54:  551| [45] ["... I see."]
 55:  556| [45] ["So she really is with the Rokumei City Security Department"--%NWatase continued as he thought that.]
 56:  564| [47] [Watase]
 57:  567| [45] ["I couldn't stand the idea that those who deserved to be punished had avoided their judgment."]
 58:  575| [47] [Watase]
 59:  578| [45] ["It made me sick to think the ones who were secretly behind that incident were living cozily without taking responsibility for their actions."]
 60:  586| [47] [Watase]
 61:  589| [45] ["That was my entire motive for assaulting LABO and trying to abduct the test subjects... to bring the truth to light."]
 62:  594| [47] [Ena]
 63:  595| [45] ["..."]
 64:  600| [45] [Ena bitterly gritted her teeth.]
 65:  605| [45] [Watase couldn't tell what that look on her face meant. She then barely managed to squeeze her next words out.]
 66:  660| [47] [Ena]
 67:  663| [45] ["... Then that girl lying by the lift... She was a test subject too, wasn't she?"]
 68:  671| [47] [Ena]
 69:  674| [45] ["Were you the one who shot her?"]
 70:  682| [47] [Watase]
 71:  685| [45] ["... No. It was either Dojima or Hiyama, my comrades."]
 72:  693| [47] [Ena]
 73:  696| [45] ["You're blaming this on the dead?"]
 74:  704| [47] [Watase]
 75:  707| [45] ["No, that's not it... Had things played out even slightly differently, I might have ended up being the one who shot her instead."]
 76:  725| [47] [Ena]
 77:  728| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 78:  736| [47] [Watase]
 79:  739| [45] ["Dojima, Hiyama, and I were not in the right mind."]
 80:  747| [47] [Watase]
 81:  750| [45] ["Since you know about the truth of the fire 16 years ago, I'm guessing you know about how people were infected by Communicator A's malice too."]
 82:  758| [47] [Watase]
 83:  761| [45] ["Well, something just like that... is happening all over again in this facility right now."]
 84:  769| [47] [Ena]
 85:  772| [45] ["!!"]
 86:  827| [47] [Ena]
 87:  830| [45] ["N-no way...! Then are you telling me Mr. Ukita and Ms. Moribe were also infected with malice!?"]
 88:  835| [45] [It seemed Ena had figured out everything from that one sentence. As expected of someone working for the government in the shadows.]
 89:  840| [45] [Watase nodded and continued.]
 90:  893| [47] [Watase]
 91:  896| [45] ["I was infected with malice too. It took the hatred for Communicators that I'd sealed away in my heart, and amplified it to the limit."]
 92:  904| [47] [Watase]
 93:  907| [45] ["And as a result... I shot Mashiro Toba and Natsuhiko as well."]
 94:  925| [47] [Ena]
 95:  928| [45] ["... No..."]
 96:  936| [47] [Watase]
 97:  939| [45] ["I'm sorry, Teach. I'm not a rescue worker anymore. I'm just a terrorist."]
 98:  947| [47] [Ena]
 99:  950| [45] ["B-but... you don't look like you're infected with malice...!"]
100:  958| [47] [Watase]
101:  961| [45] ["Right you are. You can thank Natsuhiko and Yuuri for that. They're the ones who set me free from that malice. And so I--"]
102: 1022| [47] [Ena]
103: 1025| [45] ["Huh?"]
104: 1030| [45] [Ena's eyes widened.]
105: 1056| [47] [Ena]
106: 1059| [45] ["What did you just say?"]
107: 1067| [47] [Watase]
108: 1070| [45] ["Well, you see, they repaired my memories using Senses Sympathy... and set me free from the malice."]
109: 1096| [47] [Ena]
110: 1099| [45] ["Wait, what are you talking about!? That's news to me! Repairing memories with Senses Sympathy!? Setting someone free from malice!?"]
111: 1107| [47] [Ena]
112: 1110| [45] ["Are you telling me Mr. Tenkawa and Ms. Yuuri can do all that!?"]
113: 1118| [47] [Watase]
114: 1121| [45] ["Wh... what!?"]
115: 1126| [45] [Watase was astonished.]
116: 1173| [47] [Watase]
117: 1174| [45] [(Wh-what's going on!? Shouldn't members of the security department know all about Natsuhiko and Yuuri!?)]
118: 1179| [47] [Watase]
119: 1180| [45] [(Are LABO and the security department not on the same page!?)]
120: 1185| [47] [Watase]
121: 1186| [45] [(No, that can't be! They'd never screw up like that! Wait, then in that case...)]
122: 1191| [47] [Watase]
123: 1192| [45] [(Just who in the world -is- Teach!?)]
124: 1201| [45] [Watase was about to ask her for more details,]
125: 1257| [45] [but at that moment, he heard a sound behind him.]
126: 1277| [47] [Watase]
127: 1278| [45] [(!?)]
128: 1326| [45] [He turned around in surprise-- and saw Salyu running at him from the other end of the hallway.]
129: 1334| [47] [Salyu]
130: 1337| [45] ["Shah!!"]
131: 1447| [47] [Watase]
132: 1450| [45] ["Gagh!!"]
133: 1473| [45] [By the time he noticed her, it was too late.]
134: 1478| [45] [Salyu's jump kick nailed Watase right in the chin.]
135: 1532| [45] [Thoughts raced through Watase's head as he fell to the floor.]
136: 1537| [47] [Watase]
137: 1538| [45] [(Why does this girl always have to show up at the worst possible times...!?)]
138: 1543| [45] [Though he felt close to fainting, he could still make out Salyu's and Ena's voices.]
139: 1695| [47] [Salyu]
140: 1698| [45] ["Ena. What are you doing with that gun? Are you trying to shoot this man?"]
141: 1706| [47] [Salyu]
142: 1709| [45] ["Then just shoot him already."]
143: 1735| [47] [Ena]
144: 1738| [45] ["Wh-what are you even saying, Ms. Sannomiya!?"]
145: 1743| [45] [He could hear their voices growing louder.]
146: 1748| [45] [But his concussion rendered him unable to put any strength in his hands or feet, meaning he couldn't get up.]
147: 1774| [47] [Salyu]
148: 1777| [45] ["This man shot Natsuhiko. He also tried to blow up the nuclear reactor and destroy the city. Vicious crimes not easily forgiven."]
149: 1803| [47] [Ena]
150: 1806| [45] ["Wh-what do you plan to do to Captain Kasasagi!?"]
151: 1814| [47] [Salyu]
152: 1817| [45] ["Kill him."]
153: 1843| [47] [Ena]
154: 1846| [45] ["'Kill him'--!?"]
155: 1872| [47] [Salyu]
156: 1875| [45] ["I don't really want to kill him either, but I have to do it to protect everyone."]
157: 1901| [47] [Ena]
158: 1904| [45] ["N-no, don't do it, Ms. Sannomiya!"]
159: 1930| [47] [Salyu]
160: 1933| [45] ["... Why are you stopping me?"]
161: 1959| [47] [Ena]
162: 1962| [45] ["'Why'--!?"]
163: 1988| [47] [Salyu]
164: 1991| [45] ["You're acting strange. You're still with this man even after I warned you."]
165: 1999| [47] [Salyu]
166: 2002| [45] ["You won't open your heart to us. Furthermore, you're holding a gun."]
167: 2010| [47] [Salyu]
168: 2013| [45] ["Could it be-- that you're a terrorist too?"]
169: 2039| [47] [Ena]
170: 2042| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
171: 2077| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2080| [45] ["If that's the case, then I won't show you any mercy, either."]
173: 2094| [45] [Watase could hear Salyu walking towards Ena.]
174: 2147| [47] [Watase]
175: 2150| [45] ["Ghh--UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"]
176: 2169| [45] [It was then that his body finally moved.]
177: 2175| [45] [He stretched out his hands and swung them around Salyu's leg.]
178: 2242| [47] [Salyu]
179: 2245| [45] ["!?"]
180: 2250| [45] [Salyu gasped at the same time Watase shouted.]
181: 2258| [47] [Watase]
182: 2261| [45] ["Teach, get out of here! Go to B1 of Area 5's inner ring!"]
183: 2331| [47] [Ena]
184: 2334| [45] ["Huh? Huh?"]
185: 2342| [47] [Watase]
186: 2345| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and old man Ukita are all there!"]
187: 2353| [47] [Watase]
188: 2356| [45] ["But there's a high chance they're being attacked by Moribe because of the malice she's been infected with!"]
189: 2364| [47] [Watase]
190: 2367| [45] ["Please! Save them for me!"]
191: 2372| [45] [A look of hesitation rose to Ena's face for a moment when she heard Watase's pleas.]
192: 2398| [47] [Ena]
193: 2401| [45] ["You sure about that!? You don't even know what I really am!"]
194: 2427| [47] [Ena]
195: 2430| [45] ["You sure you can trust someone who could be infected with malice!?"]
196: 2435| [45] [Those words triggered Watase's memory.]
197: 2504| [45] [He remembered how Ena had stood up for him back when Jun and Ukita had been pressing him hard in the surveillance room.]
198: 2512| [47] [Watase]
199: 2515| [45] ["You trusted me back then! That's why I trust you!"]
200: 2597| [47] [Ena]
201: 2600| [45] ["..."]
202: 2605| [45] [Those words softened Ena's face.]
203: 2631| [47] [Ena]
204: 2634| [45] ["You really are too soft for your own good, you know that!?"]
205: 2654| [45] [She then started running down the hallway.]
206: 2691| [45] [Salyu shook off Watase's grip at the same time.]
207: 2699| [47] [Salyu]
208: 2702| [45] ["Out of my way."]
209: 2865| [45] [She kicked Watase in the head.]
210: 2873| [47] [Watase]
211: 2876| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
212: 2881| [45] [Watase mustered all his willpower to keep his fading consciousness tethered.]
