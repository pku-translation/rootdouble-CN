  0:   65| [45] [--But naturally, it was not as if she had any complaints about the current Natsuhiko.]
  1:   70| [45] [He had become so quiet that he seemed to be a completely different person, but Mashiro believed that the old Natsuhiko was still there at his core.]
  2:  108| [45] [But even so, once they came to a certain place where they shared memories long past--]
  3:  113| [45] [She couldn't help but feel her heart tear in two.]
  4:  139| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  142| [45] ["Mashiro... I don't know how to say this, but you're a good person."]
  6:  147| [45] [That's what Natsuhiko had said as they returned from their field trip.]
  7:  152| [45] [His embarrassed expression was the same as how he was as a boy.]
  8:  157| [45] [Something suddenly tightened in Mashiro's chest, forcing her to look away.]
  9:  162| [47] [Mashiro]
 10:  165| [45] ["... What are you talking about? I'm just copying what you did back in the day."]
 11:  191| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 12:  194| [45] ["Really? Was I really that good a guy back then?"]
 13:  199| [47] [Mashiro]
 14:  202| [45] ["Well, I think you still are a pretty good guy, Natsuhiko. Your one weakness is that you can get stubborn sometimes, though."]
 15:  228| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  231| [45] ["... Maybe, I guess."]
 17:  236| [45] [Natsuhiko scratched his head in contemplation.]
 18:  262| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  265| [45] ["Fine... you win, Mashiro. I'll try to lower my guard at least a little."]
 20:  270| [47] [Mashiro]
 21:  273| [45] ["Yeah, that should be good enough. 'This will have to do for now' and all."]
 22:  299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  302| [45] ["What's that, another anime quote?"]
 24:  307| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  310| [45] ["Yeah. One from way before we were born, though."]
 26:  333| [45] [When Mashiro smiled, Natsuhiko smiled back.]
 27:  338| [45] [As she looked at his smile, Mashiro secretly thought to herself.]
 28:  371| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  372| [45] [(Yeah. This will have to do for now...)]
 30:  377| [45] [Mashiro could do nothing for him but watch over him and support him.]
 31:  382| [45] [She didn't do it to boast, nor did she want Natsuhiko to know what she was doing or how she felt.]
 32:  387| [45] [As such, perhaps she really was doing it for Natsuhiko's sake. Her inconsistencies were endless.]
 33:  392| [45] [Nevertheless, Mashiro thought that she would stay by his side like this forever.]
 34:  397| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  398| [45] [(This is for the best...)]
 36:  403| [47] [Mashiro]
 37:  404| [45] [(If I don't at least believe that I'm doing the right thing, then everything I'm doing for Natsuhiko will really be all for nothing.)]
 38:  409| [47] [Mashiro]
 39:  410| [45] [(... Let's leave it at that for now...)]
 40:  415| [45] [--Those days would eventually come to an end.]
 41:  420| [45] [Their daily life would one day collapse, but there was indeed peace within that life.]
 42:  425| [45] [Like their nostalgic chat in the park illuminated by the glow of the setting sun.]
 43:  430| [45] [Even if that peace were only temporary, it was an irreplaceable treasure to her.]
 44:  435| [47] [Mashiro]
 45:  438| [45] ["... Hey, Natsuhiko."]
 46:  464| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  467| [45] ["Hmm?"]
 48:  472| [47] [Mashiro]
 49:  475| [45] ["I'm kinda glad we talked about all these things today."]
 50:  480| [47] [Mashiro]
 51:  483| [45] ["Let's come here again sometime when we've got time."]
 52:  491| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  494| [45] ["Yeah... every now and then, I guess."]
 54:  499| [45] [As Natsuhiko muttered that, a gentle breeze enveloped them.]
 55:  583| [45] [Mashiro gazed at his face from the side and silently prayed.]
 56:  588| [45] [If only this moment of peace could last forever...]
