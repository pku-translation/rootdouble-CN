  0:   52| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 3]
  1:   70| [47] [Watase]
  2:   73| [45] ["Th... that was too close...!"]
  3:   78| [45] [Watase's voice was faint.]
  4:   83| [45] [The group had just barely escaped from the collapsing staircase with their lives.]
  5:  109| [47] [Yuuri]
  6:  112| [45] ["I never expected that the staircase would collapse on us..."]
  7:  139| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  142| [45] ["Is there any way we can go down from there?"]
  9:  147| [45] [Watase took a look into the stairwell.]
 10:  195| [45] [But the collapsed stairs blocked the door, meaning it was unlikely they could get to the other side.]
 11:  203| [47] [Watase]
 12:  206| [45] ["Heeey, Teach! Can you hear me!?"]
 13:  211| [45] [However... there was no reply.]
 14:  216| [45] [It seemed she'd gone to some other room to continue with the search.]
 15:  268| [47] [Watase]
 16:  271| [45] ["Crap, we're completely cut off from Teach!"]
 17:  297| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  300| [45] ["That's why I warned everyone not to go off on their own...!"]
 19:  327| [47] [Jun]
 20:  330| [45] ["No choice. Let's use the inner ring's emergency staircase to regroup with her!"]
 21:  352| [45] [The group nodded and headed for the inner ring.]
 22:  400| [45] [But the staircase there--]
 23:  444| [45] [--had also collapsed.]
 24:  497| [47] [Watase]
 25:  500| [45] ["Tch, guess we'll have to go down from another area?"]
 26:  526| [47] [Kazami]
 27:  529| [45] ["Yes. Then--"]
 28:  534| [45] [Kazami took out her PDA and began muttering to herself.]
 29:  582| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  585| [45] ["This staircase and that staircase are out of commission..."]
 31:  630| [45] [She placed X-marks on the staircases on the map.]
 32:  642| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  645| [45] ["So we'll have to take a detour through Area 6. Let's go."]
 34:  660| [45] [The group nodded again and headed for Area 6 this time.]
 35:  757| [45] [But thanks to the fire--]
 36:  762| [45] [The security slot that controlled the gate to Area 6 was out of order.]
 37:  813| [45] [Sliding the card into it did nothing.]
 38:  821| [47] [Watase]
 39:  824| [45] ["Luck's just not on our side... let's try the outer ring's gate."]
 40:  870| [45] [Watase added another X-mark on his PDA's map and headed for the outer ring.]
 41:  918| [45] [--But the connecting passageway to the outer ring was buried in rubble.]
 42:  964| [45] [The passageway was completely blocked off by collapsed pieces of ceiling and walls.]
 43:  969| [45] [And on top of all that, it appeared that the hole in the ceiling didn't connect to the surface floors.]
 44:  977| [47] [Watase]
 45:  980| [45] ["C-crap... this is really bad, isn't it?"]
 46: 1013| [47] [Kazami]
 47: 1016| [45] ["Khh..."]
 48: 1021| [45] [Kazami gritted her teeth and checked her PDA.]
 49: 1069| [47] [Kazami]
 50: 1072| [45] ["Both connecting passageways to Area 6 won't work. And the staircases are out..."]
 51: 1080| [47] [Jun]
 52: 1083| [45] ["Meaning we have no way to get down to B2, huh?"]
 53: 1091| [47] [Yuuri]
 54: 1094| [45] ["Couldn't we go through the B2 Area 4 route?"]
 55: 1102| [47] [Kazami]
 56: 1105| [45] ["Unfortunately... the outer ring's card slot there was burned in the fire."]
 57: 1113| [47] [Jun]
 58: 1116| [45] ["And the inner ring's a contaminated zone..."]
 59: 1124| [47] [Ukita]
 60: 1127| [45] ["Wait, you're not saying--!?"]
 61: 1135| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1138| [45] ["Yeah... we've hit a dead end."]
 63: 1143| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth.]
 64: 1148| [45] [All their ways forward were completely cut off.]
 65: 1191| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1194| [45] ["I'm worried about Teach... we've gotta find a way downstairs. We don't have a choice."]
 67: 1202| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1205| [45] ["What if we used the connecting passageway in the contaminated zone?"]
 69: 1231| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1234| [45] ["No, it's too dangerous to bring everyone through a contaminated zone."]
 71: 1262| [47] [Yuuri]
 72: 1265| [45] ["Wh-what should we do...?"]
 73: 1291| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1294| [45] ["This is a conundrum... if only the elevators were working..."]
 75: 1299| [45] [Ukita bemoaned this in a voice devoid of hope--]
 76: 1304| [45] [But that comment suddenly lit a lightbulb in Watase's mind.]
 77: 1312| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1315| [45] ["... Huh!? Wait, we might be able to get down through there!"]
 79: 1341| [47] [Kazami]
 80: 1344| [45] ["Huh? From where!?"]
 81: 1352| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1355| [45] ["This way! Follow me!"]
 83: 1403| [45] [Watase then ran off, with the rest of the group following close behind.]
 84: 1475| [45] [He finally stopped at the elevator hall.]
 85: 1537| [47] [Jun]
 86: 1540| [45] ["Hey, Captain? You do remember the elevators aren't working, right?"]
 87: 1548| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1551| [45] ["I know. But maybe, just maybe..."]
 89: 1632| [45] [Watase clasped the elevator doors and pried them open.]
 90: 1675| [45] [--The elevator car was apparently resting on the surface floors.]
 91: 1680| [45] [Watase looked into the elevator shaft, then yelled.]
 92: 1688| [47] [Watase]
 93: 1691| [45] ["... Yes, I was right!"]
 94: 1696| [45] [There was a ladder there.]
 95: 1730| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1733| [45] ["This is a maintenance ladder... yes, it -does- look like we could use this to get down."]
 97: 1760| [47] [Jun]
 98: 1763| [45] ["It's a long way down, though. You guys sure you'll be okay with that?"]
 99: 1790| [47] [Ukita]
100: 1793| [45] ["Mmm, I think I can make it... so long as I don't look down."]
101: 1840| [47] [Watase]
102: 1843| [45] ["Good. Then let's go down one at a time."]
103: 1848| [45] [But Yuuri's face went as white as a sheet at that moment.]
104: 1874| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1877| [45] ["I... I can't climb down from this high up..."]
106: 1950| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1953| [45] ["Don't worry, Ms. Yuuri, we'll back you up."]
108: 1981| [47] [Jun]
109: 1984| [45] ["She's right. Just hang in there."]
110: 2010| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 2013| [45] ["B-but..."]
112: 2018| [45] [But there was no way they could leave Yuuri there.]
113: 2023| [45] [It was too dangerous to split the group up any further.]
114: 2038| [47] [Watase]
115: 2041| [45] ["Okay. If you can't get down on your own, then how about I carry you on my back when I climb down?"]
116: 2067| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 2070| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
118: 2075| [45] [Yuuri stared at Watase with wide eyes.]
119: 2080| [47] [Watase]
120: 2081| [45] [(Uh-oh... is she going to reject me again?)]
121: 2086| [45] [Watase grew nervous for a moment, but after hesitating for a second--]
122: 2091| [45] [Yuuri nodded.]
123: 2117| [47] [Yuuri]
124: 2120| [45] ["Okay... please be careful."]
125: 2128| [47] [Watase]
126: 2131| [45] ["O-of course! Leave it to me!"]
127: 2143| [47] [Watase]
128: 2146| [45] ["Yuuri, are you sure you can't get down by yourself?"]
129: 2151| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 2152| [45] ["..."]
131: 2160| [47] [Watase]
132: 2163| [45] ["Oh great...!"]
133: 2168| [45] [They couldn't afford to waste time in this situation--%Njust as Watase thought this, Jun spoke up.]
134: 2194| [47] [Jun]
135: 2197| [45] ["Then how 'bout you hang on to the Captain's back when he goes down?"]
136: 2223| [47] [Yuuri]
137: 2226| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
138: 2252| [47] [Jun]
139: 2255| [45] ["Don't worry, you'll be safe with him. You cool with that, Captain?"]
140: 2263| [47] [Watase]
141: 2266| [45] ["Y-yeah, I don't mind..."]
142: 2271| [45] [Watase glanced at Yuuri.]
143: 2276| [47] [Watase]
144: 2277| [45] [(Is she gonna reject me again...?)]
145: 2282| [45] [However, Yuuri defied his expectations by nodding.]
146: 2308| [47] [Yuuri]
147: 2311| [45] ["Okay... let's do that then, please."]
148: 2319| [47] [Watase]
149: 2322| [45] ["O-okay! Leave it to me!"]
150: 2348| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2351| [45] ["Then I'll go down before the both of you and wait on standby at the bottom, just in case something goes wrong."]
152: 2377| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2380| [45] ["Moribe and Mr. Ukita, go down first and please look for Ms. Tsubakiyama."]
154: 2406| [47] [Jun]
155: 2409| [45] ["Roger!"]
156: 2435| [47] [Ukita]
157: 2438| [45] ["All right, I'll do it."]
158: 2443| [45] [So with that, the group decided to head down to B2 through the elevator shaft.]
159: 2486| [45] [Jun and Ukita went first, followed by Kazami.]
160: 2491| [45] [Their voices soon echoed up from the bottom.]
161: 2525| [47] [Jun]
162: 2528| [45] ["Okay, we're going on ahead!"]
163: 2555| [47] [Ukita]
164: 2558| [45] ["Get down here as soon as you can."]
165: 2585| [47] [Kazami]
166: 2588| [45] ["Roger that. Okay then Captain, your turn."]
167: 2621| [45] [After listening to all that, Watase and Yuuri got ready to go down.]
168: 2629| [47] [Watase]
169: 2632| [45] ["Okay Yuuri, let's go."]
170: 2709| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2710| [45] ["..."]
172: 2715| [45] [Yuuri silently wrapped her hands around Watase's neck.]
173: 2720| [45] [Watase made sure her body was held securely by the rope, then leapt into the shaft.]
174: 2803| [45] [He then slowly descended the ladder.]
175: 2808| [45] [He could feel Yuuri's body trembling slightly through his back.]
176: 2826| [47] [Watase]
177: 2829| [45] ["... Yuuri, are you scared?"]
178: 2837| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 2840| [45] ["... Y-yes..."]
180: 2848| [47] [Watase]
181: 2851| [45] ["Don't worry. Trust me."]
182: 2856| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 2857| [45] ["..."]
184: 2862| [45] [Yuuri didn't answer.]
185: 2867| [45] [She just held on tight to Watase's neck so she could keep steady.]
186: 2872| [45] [Watase climbed down the ladder slowly so that his body rocked as little as possible.]
187: 2877| [45] [--A short time later, Yuuri whispered into his ear.]
188: 2886| [45] [Watase climbed down the ladder slowly so that his body rocked as little as possible.]
189: 2891| [45] [--A short time later, Yuuri whispered into his ear.]
190: 2905| [47] [Yuuri]
191: 2908| [45] ["... Um..."]
192: 2916| [47] [Watase]
193: 2919| [45] ["Hmm?"]
194: 2927| [47] [Yuuri]
195: 2930| [45] ["I'm not heavy, am I...?"]
196: 2935| [45] [Watase's cracked ribs suddenly started hurting again when she asked this--%Nbut he didn't let that show.]
197: 2943| [47] [Watase]
198: 2946| [45] ["Nope, you're pretty light. I bet I could carry another ten of you and still be okay."]
199: 2954| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 2957| [45] ["..."]
201: 2962| [45] [Watase thought he heard Yuuri let out a faint chuckle.]
202: 2967| [45] [The air grew silent again.]
203: 2972| [45] [Yuuri spoke up again as if she hated that silence.]
204: 2980| [47] [Yuuri]
205: 2983| [45] ["... Captain Kasasagi, can I ask you a question?"]
206: 2991| [47] [Watase]
207: 2994| [45] ["Sure, fire away."]
208: 3002| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 3005| [45] ["It... it feels like you're always worrying about me..."]
210: 3013| [47] [Yuuri]
211: 3016| [45] ["Why is that...?"]
212: 3024| [47] [Watase]
213: 3027| [45] ["Oh, does it make you uncomfortable?"]
214: 3035| [47] [Yuuri]
215: 3038| [45] ["No! Not at all! It's just... I'm a total stranger to you. So why?"]
216: 3046| [47] [Watase]
217: 3049| [45] ["Hmm..."]
218: 3054| [45] [Watase was happy that Yuuri was actively striking up a conversation with him for the first time since they'd met.]
219: 3059| [45] [So after thinking about it for a while, he answered honestly.]
220: 3067| [47] [Watase]
221: 3070| [45] ["... You might think I'm crazy after hearing this, but... I heard this voice when I first saw you."]
222: 3078| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 3081| [45] ["A voice?"]
224: 3089| [47] [Watase]
225: 3092| [45] ["It told me to save you."]
226: 3100| [47] [Watase]
227: 3103| [45] ["It wasn't Tachibana or Moribe's voice. It felt like it was echoing from inside my head."]
228: 3111| [47] [Yuuri]
229: 3114| [45] ["..."]
230: 3122| [47] [Watase]
231: 3125| [45] ["It's not like I obeyed the voice--"]
232: 3133| [47] [Watase]
233: 3136| [45] ["But when I first met you, I felt this mysterious yet powerful desire to save you."]
234: 3144| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 3147| [45] ["..."]
236: 3152| [45] [Yuuri didn't say anything.]
237: 3157| [45] [Watase felt a tinge of embarrassment come over him.]
238: 3165| [47] [Watase]
239: 3168| [45] ["... Yep, I knew it sounded crazy. It was like I was hearing an auditory hallucination or something like that."]
240: 3176| [47] [Yuuri]
241: 3179| [45] ["N-no, that's not it! If you had to ask me..."]
242: 3188| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 3191| [45] ["I think that might have been the 'Third Man factor'..."]
244: 3199| [47] [Watase]
245: 3202| [45] ["What's that?"]
246: 3210| [47] [Yuuri]
247: 3213| [45] ["Well... I read about it in a book."]
248: 3221| [47] [Yuuri]
249: 3224| [45] ["When people are thrown into extreme situations such as disasters or accidents... they say that they hear a voice that isn't actually there."]
250: 3232| [47] [Watase]
251: 3235| [45] ["Huh, so something like that actually exists?"]
252: 3243| [47] [Yuuri]
253: 3246| [45] ["... They also say that the voice is always telling that person what actions they should take."]
254: 3254| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 3257| [45] ["There have been many reported cases of this phenomenon all over the world, usually from people who survived being stuck on a snowy mountain."]
256: 3265| [47] [Watase]
257: 3268| [45] ["Sure is a strange phenomenon, that's for sure... Wonder why it happens."]
258: 3273| [45] [After considering what Yuuri had just told him, Watase suddenly remembered something.]
259: 3281| [47] [Watase]
260: 3284| [45] ["... Wait, could that be an example of that... uh, what'd Teach call it... that 'BC' thing?"]
261: 3292| [47] [Yuuri]
262: 3295| [45] ["Huh?"]
263: 3303| [47] [Watase]
264: 3306| [45] ["She said there's a lot of people nowadays who can use telepathy, right?"]
265: 3314| [47] [Watase]
266: 3317| [45] ["Maybe there's some nice guy out there who knows of the trouble we're going through and is using telepathy to tell us what we should do?"]
267: 3325| [47] [Yuuri]
268: 3328| [45] ["... That would be wonderful... but here's what I think it is."]
269: 3336| [47] [Watase]
270: 3339| [45] ["Hmm?"]
271: 3347| [47] [Yuuri]
272: 3350| [45] ["The human mind... their knowledge and memories, that is-- works at its absolute best in extreme situations like this..."]
273: 3358| [47] [Yuuri]
274: 3361| [45] ["And so it tells you 'what you should do' in the form of a voice echoing in your head... perhaps?"]
275: 3369| [47] [Watase]
276: 3372| [45] ["Memories, huh. But I don't have any of those..."]
277: 3380| [47] [Yuuri]
278: 3383| [45] ["But it's said that even when you lose your memories, they leave behind a vague 'feeling'."]
279: 3391| [47] [Yuuri]
280: 3394| [45] ["So perhaps in your case, that feeling in your mind was the strong 'desire to save people'."]
281: 3402| [47] [Watase]
282: 3405| [45] ["I see... that might be it."]
283: 3410| [45] [That was a much more fitting mindset than the idea that someone was ordering him around with BC.]
284: 3415| [45] [That desire to save Yuuri that he'd felt back then was most certainly not vague.]
285: 3423| [47] [Watase]
286: 3426| [45] ["... So maybe that's why I get so desperate to save people even without my knowledge and memories."]
287: 3436| [47] [Yuuri]
288: 3439| [45] ["Yes. I'm sure of it..."]
289: 3444| [45] [His heart warmed at Yuuri's whisper.]
290: 3449| [47] [Watase]
291: 3450| [45] [("Even when you lose your memories, they leave behind a vague feeling", huh...)]
292: 3455| [45] [In terms of abilities, there was probably a world of difference between the past him and his current self.]
293: 3460| [45] [But the core of his heart and mind might be the same with or without memories.]
294: 3465| [45] [His heart felt a bit lighter when he thought of it that way.]
295: 3473| [47] [Watase]
296: 3476| [45] ["Thanks, Yuuri. I think I really needed that."]
297: 3484| [47] [Yuuri]
298: 3487| [45] ["Ah, oh, you're welcome..."]
299: 3492| [45] [The end of the ladder grew closer and closer as Yuuri stuttered.]
300: 3497| [47] [Watase]
301: 3498| [45] [(Tch, we're already there, huh...)]
302: 3503| [45] [Watase pushed aside his desire to stay the way they were now and got off the ladder.]
303: 3512| [47] [Yuuri]
304: 3515| [45] ["Yes, I think it'd be nice too... I really do..."]
305: 3520| [45] [Watase felt a slight anxiety emerge in him when he heard that.]
306: 3525| [45] [It sounded like there was some hidden meaning behind her words in the way she'd said that.]
307: 3530| [47] [Watase]
308: 3531| [45] [(Don't tell me that Yuuri is still being cautious of me...)]
309: 3536| [47] [Watase]
310: 3537| [45] [(If that's the case, then why is she so...?)]
311: 3542| [45] [The end of the ladder grew closer and closer as he thought that.]
312: 3547| [45] [Watase got off the ladder while still entrapped by those inescapable thoughts.]
313: 3603| [47] [Watase]
314: 3606| [45] ["All right, we're finally here."]
315: 3611| [45] [Yuuri breathed a sigh of relief against the back of his neck when she heard that.]
316: 3645| [47] [Yuuri]
317: 3648| [45] ["Whew..."]
318: 3681| [47] [Kazami]
319: 3684| [45] ["You did a good job of hanging in there. You can rest easy now."]
320: 3692| [47] [Yuuri]
321: 3695| [45] ["O-okay..."]
322: 3715| [45] [Kazami untied the rope and helped Yuuri down to the floor.]
323: 3743| [47] [Yuuri]
324: 3746| [45] ["U-um... Captain Kasasagi..."]
325: 3754| [47] [Watase]
326: 3757| [45] ["Hmm? What's up?"]
327: 3783| [47] [Yuuri]
328: 3786| [45] ["Th... thank you very much..."]
329: 3794| [47] [Watase]
330: 3797| [45] ["Ah, don't sweat it. We only made it because you were brave."]
331: 3805| [47] [Yuuri]
332: 3808| [45] ["..."]
333: 3834| [47] [Kazami]
334: 3837| [45] ["Then let's get going. We need to catch up with Ms. Tsubakiyama."]
335: 3845| [47] [Watase]
336: 3848| [45] ["Yeah, you're right."]
337: 3902| [45] [And so Watase and the others pried open the elevator doors--]
338: 3907| [45] [And entered B2.]
