  1:   56| [45] [--After seeing the circumstances through static-filled vision--]
  2:  106| [45] [Natsuhiko returned to his own body and took a deep breath.]
  3:  114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  117| [45] ["... I contacted Watase and the others. I told them to regroup in the control room."]
  5:  143| [47] [Yuuri]
  6:  146| [45] ["The control room?"]
  7:  154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  157| [45] ["It seems we can steal Brain Cell's root authority with the hacking software Mom prepared."]
  9:  165| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  168| [45] ["So once we retrieve that software, we'll gather with everyone in the control room."]
 11:  195| [47] [Salyu]
 12:  198| [45] ["Fine by me, but--"]
 13:  230| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  233| [45] ["Isn't that 'Watase' man our enemy?"]
 15:  241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  244| [45] ["... He's an ally now."]
 17:  252| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  255| [45] ["Salyu, I know you might not be able to forgive him, but... could you promise not to attack him just for now?"]
 19:  263| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  266| [45] ["We need his cooperation to get everyone out of here."]
 21:  289| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  290| [45] ["..."]
 23:  316| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  319| [45] ["... Understood. I'll do as you say, Natsuhiko."]
 25:  327| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  330| [45] ["Thanks, Salyu."]
 27:  390| [45] [And after saying that, Natsuhiko then used Senses Sympathy on Ukita.]
 28:  454| [45] [--His connection with Ukita was plagued with noise as well.]
 29:  459| [45] [Natsuhiko mustered all his strength to send telepathy to Ukita.]
 30:  467| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  470| [45] [{Mr. Ukita, can you hear me!?}]
 32:  496| [47] [Ukita]
 33:  499| [45] [{Huh!? Ahh--... can manage... hear you... --at happened?}]
 34:  507| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  510| [45] [{With the exception of Ms. Tachibana, everyone's malice has been erased! Let's regroup at the control room for now!}]
 36:  518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  521| [45] [{The shelter's no longer safe with its door broken, so please take Mashiro with you!}]
 38:  526| [45] [Mashiro was sleeping in the shelter under Ukita's protection.]
 39:  531| [45] [Ukita responded with a strained voice.]
 40:  555| [47] [Ukita]
 41:  558| [45] [{--ntrol room, --ight!? --...--ger that!}]
 42:  582| [45] [It appears he managed to get through to him.]
 43:  587| [45] [Natsuhiko returned to his body once more and reported to Yuuri and Salyu.]
 44:  595| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  598| [45] ["I told Mr. Ukita to bring Mashiro with him to the control room."]
 46:  606| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  609| [45] ["We'll head to Mom's office first and bring the hacking software to the control room."]
 48:  635| [47] [Yuuri]
 49:  638| [45] ["Understood."]
 50:  664| [47] [Salyu]
 51:  667| [45] ["Then I'll carry you on my back again. Hurry."]
 52:  675| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  678| [45] ["R-right."]
 54:  729| [45] [There was no time to be embarrassed about appearances, so Natsuhiko did as Salyu said.]
 55:  833| [45] [--And thus they went to Area 5 and headed to Miyoko Tenkawa's office.]
 56:  890| [45] [They searched inside the room.]
 57:  898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  901| [45] ["Mom said it's on the lower shelf farthest back in the room."]
 59:  907| [45] [And it was locked, just as she had said.]
 60:  949| [47] [Salyu]
 61:  952| [45] ["Natsuhiko, out of the way."]
 62:  960| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  963| [45] ["Huh? Oh!"]
 64: 1055| [45] [Salyu kicked the cabinet door open.]
 65: 1060| [45] [And then a stuffed animal-shaped device tumbled out.]
 66: 1145| [47] [Salyu]
 67: 1148| [45] ["Huh? Alice?"]
 68: 1156| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1159| [45] ["No, it's an ARMS unit that's the same model as Alice."]
 70: 1167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1170| [45] ["... Wait, now that you mention it, what happened to Alice?"]
 72: 1178| [47] [Salyu]
 73: 1181| [45] ["I didn't want to break her, so I hid her in the girl's restroom in Area 4."]
 74: 1189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1192| [45] ["I see... that way Watase couldn't find her, huh."]
 76: 1246| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1249| [45] ["In that case, I'll take this ARMS unit-- Alice Number 2-- with me, then."]
 78: 1266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1269| [45] ["Yeah. Let's hurry to the control room."]
 80: 1358| [45] [But right as Natsuhiko said that and they were about to leave the room--]
 81: 1363| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1364| [45] [(Hmm...?)]
 83: 1370| [45] [A note posted on the wall suddenly caught Natsuhiko's attention:]
 84: 1375| [45] ["Informational Field Self-Awareness Development Experiment - 9/16 6:00 AM~"]
 85: 1383| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86: 1386| [45] ["... Hey, Yuuri. Was Mom trying to run some sort of experiment this morning?"]
 87: 1449| [47] [Yuuri]
 88: 1452| [45] ["Huh? Ah, yes."]
 89: 1460| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1463| [45] ["I had to take a health exam early this morning because of that experiment."]
 91: 1471| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1474| [45] ["Is that so? Then what exactly is this 'Informational Field Self-Awareness Development Experiment' about?"]
 93: 1500| [47] [Yuuri]
 94: 1503| [45] ["Hmm, it's hard to explain, but--"]
 95: 1529| [47] [Yuuri]
 96: 1532| [45] ["Simply put, it's an experiment to 'create a spirit'."]
 97: 1540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 98: 1543| [45] ["To create a spirit...?"]
 99: 1548| [45] [For some reason, Natsuhiko got horribly caught up on those words.]
100: 1553| [45] [He knew this wasn't exactly the time to talk about it-- but he couldn't help but ask questions.]
101: 1561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1564| [45] ["Create a spirit? What does that mean? What's Mom trying to do here?"]
103: 1591| [47] [Salyu]
104: 1594| [45] ["Hold on, Natsuhiko. Is that something you need to know right now?"]
105: 1602| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1605| [45] ["I don't know... but it kind of bothers me. I'm sorry, Yuuri, but could you give a rough explanation for me, please?"]
107: 1616| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1619| [45] ["O-okay. I'll explain."]
109: 1624| [45] [Yuuri quickly began to explain.]
110: 1675| [47] [Yuuri]
111: 1678| [45] ["Well, first of all, this is second-hand information from the professor, but... this world is filled with BC particles."]
112: 1686| [47] [Yuuri]
113: 1689| [45] ["And of course, even the human brain is filled with high-energy BC particles."]
114: 1697| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1700| [45] ["Intracerebral BC particles affect the brain, and are affected by the brain. They have no substance, but they certainly exist."]
116: 1708| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1711| [45] ["Doesn't that sound similar to something often talked about in the past?"]
118: 1719| [47] [Natsuhiko]
119: 1722| [45] ["Consciousness... no... the 'spirit'...?"]
120: 1748| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1751| [45] ["Yes. The professor thought that if what we called the spirit were to actually exist, it might consist of the BC particles that fill the brain."]
122: 1756| [45] [That sentiment closely resembled the things that the Subject Ns inside of Watase and Ukita had said.]
123: 1764| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1767| [45] ["Then let's say you were able to create a lump of high-energy BC particles outside of the brain. Would that make a spirit?"]
125: 1793| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1796| [45] ["Would it indeed? That was the purpose of today's experiment."]
127: 1853| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1856| [45] ["The experimental procedure was to use the WX particle amplifier to create a roughly 500 mSv WX particle field in Area N."]
129: 1864| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1867| [45] ["But WX particles are merely lumps of energy without any sort of information. An 'empty spirit', so to speak."]
131: 1875| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1878| [45] ["But afterwards, I was to enter Area N and continue using BC for several hours."]
133: 1886| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 1889| [45] ["BC? On whom?"]
135: 1922| [47] [Yuuri]
136: 1925| [45] ["Nobody. Just untargeted telepathy."]
137: 1952| [47] [Salyu]
138: 1955| [45] ["Why do that...?"]
139: 1963| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1966| [45] ["Basically, this is what the professor wanted to test:"]
141: 1992| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 1995| [45] ["If I took all of my intracerebral information energy and emitted it outside my brain with BC--"]
143: 2003| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 2006| [45] ["Would that create a copy of my spirit?"]
145: 2032| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2035| [45] ["...!?"]
147: 2040| [45] [Something like an electric current ran down Natsuhiko's spine as he heard that question.]
148: 2045| [45] [He felt as if there were some sort of truth he never realized hidden within Yuuri's words...]
149: 2053| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2056| [45] ["S... so, were you able to make a spirit then?"]
151: 2082| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2085| [45] ["Hmm... I don't think so. This incident happened before the experiment could start, so--"]
153: 2090| [45] [Before Yuuri could finish,]
154: 2095| [45] [a voice abruptly echoed inside Natsuhiko's head.]
155: 2199| [85] [{STOP!!!!!!}]
156: 2200| [86] [???]
157: 2201| [86] [{STOP!!!!!!}]
158: 2268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2271| [45] ["Huh!?"]
160: 2276| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped.]
161: 2284| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 2287| [45] ["S-stop!?"]
163: 2295| [47] [Salyu]
164: 2298| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
165: 2303| [45] [Yuuri and Salyu both opened their eyes and looked at Natsuhiko.]
166: 2335| [47] [Yuuri]
167: 2338| [45] ["Hikorin, did you use telepathy just now...?"]
168: 2346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2349| [45] ["N-no! I didn't!"]
170: 2354| [45] [That's right-- Natsuhiko didn't use telepathy at all.]
171: 2359| [45] [And yet all three of them heard that voice.]
172: 2364| [45] [A voice that clearly sounded like Natsuhiko's telepathy.]
173: 2369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2370| [45] [(No, that's not all that's strange!)]
175: 2375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2376| [45] [(Why would I hear my own telepathy!?)]
177: 2381| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind, the voice echoed once more.]
178: 2459| [85] [{I'll wreck your brain!!!!}]
179: 2460| [86] [???]
180: 2461| [86] [{I'll wreck your brain!!!!}]
181: 2586| [85] [{Wreck it wreck it wreck it wreck it!!!!!}]
182: 2587| [86] [???]
183: 2588| [86] [{Wreck it wreck it wreck it wreck it!!!!!}]
184: 2619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
185: 2622| [45] ["Ghh!!"]
186: 2630| [47] [Yuuri]
187: 2633| [45] ["Kyaaahhh!"]
188: 2641| [47] [Salyu]
189: 2644| [45] ["Ggh, ggh...!"]
190: 2649| [45] [It was telepathy intense enough to shake their very minds.]
191: 2657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2660| [45] ["Wh-what is this!? What's going on!?"]
193: 2665| [45] [As he screamed, Natsuhiko suddenly remembered--]
194: 2670| [45] [--He had fired out that telepathy before.]
195: 2723| [45] [--It was from back when he ran away with Mashiro in his arms as Watase attacked them.]
196: 2728| [45] [Natsuhiko had fired intense telepathy in order to freeze Watase in his tracks.]
197: 2789| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2792| [45] [{STOP!!!!!}]
199: 2800| [47] [Watase]
200: 2803| [45] ["Ghh!?"]
201: 2853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2854| [45] [(That was telepathy from back then... Why are we hearing it now?)]
203: 2859| [45] [For a moment, he had no idea what was going on--]
204: 2864| [45] [But then he remembered one of Ena's lectures.]
205: 2937| [47] [Ena]
206: 2940| [45] ["BC energy created by telepathy starts decaying after it's sent, but it's not like it fades to zero immediately."]
207: 2948| [47] [Ena]
208: 2951| [45] ["So in other words, with or without a target, extraordinarily strong BC can remain in place for a while..."]
209: 2970| [47] [Natsuhiko]
210: 2973| [45] ["... My telepathy... is lingering...?"]
211: 2999| [47] [Salyu]
212: 3002| [45] ["Huh? Was that voice telepathy you used before?"]
213: 3010| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3013| [45] ["Yeah. I don't know why, but it looks like it's come back."]
215: 3039| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 3042| [45] ["Maybe the information energy stayed around? It's a rare occurrence, but it does--"]
217: 3047| [45] [Before Yuuri could finish--]
218: 3093| [45] [--another Yuuri appeared in the middle of the room.]
219: 3151| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3154| [45] ["Waah!"]
221: 3162| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 3165| [45] ["Th-there's another me!?"]
223: 3173| [47] [Salyu]
224: 3176| [45] ["Wha-wha-wha..."]
225: 3181| [45] [It was a somewhat blurry, surreal visage.]
226: 3186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 3187| [45] [(A phantom!?)]
228: 3192| [45] [With Natsuhiko at a loss for words, the phantom Yuuri spoke.]
229: 3256| [47] [Phantom]
230: 3259| [45] [{... I'm sorry for deceiving you for so long.}]
231: 3267| [47] [Phantom]
232: 3270| [45] [{... But I'm sure you'll be okay without me now.}]
233: 3278| [47] [Phantom]
234: 3281| [45] [{You've noticed it these past few days, haven't you? You're not alone, Hikorin.}]
235: 3286| [45] [Those words jogged Natsuhiko's memory.]
236: 3294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 3297| [45] ["Th-this... is from the time Yuuri's phantom disappeared...!"]
238: 3305| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 3308| [45] ["Ah... Now my telepathy's come back?"]
240: 3313| [45] [That was the telepathy Yuuri had used a few hours ago to separate Natsuhiko from the phantom.]
241: 3318| [45] [It was high-grade telepathy that worked not only to cause an auditory hallucination, but a visual one as well.]
242: 3377| [45] [--And as soon as they had realized what happened, the phantom disappeared.]
243: 3423| [45] [The kids murmured in dumbfounded shock.]
244: 3431| [47] [Natsuhiko]
245: 3434| [45] ["... Why did that happen over and over?"]
246: 3460| [47] [Yuuri]
247: 3463| [45] ["H-hmm, I wonder why..."]
248: 3489| [47] [Yuuri]
249: 3492| [45] ["Perhaps it's because we've used BC repeatedly in a WX particle-rich environment?"]
250: 3518| [47] [Yuuri]
251: 3521| [45] ["Such an environment would indeed make it easier for information energy to linger..."]
252: 3529| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 3532| [45] ["I see... Hopefully that's all it was."]
254: 3558| [47] [Salyu]
255: 3561| [45] ["As long as you know the cause, it doesn't really matter. There are more important issues at hand."]
256: 3569| [47] [Salyu]
257: 3572| [45] ["We should finish the idle chatter and continue moving forward."]
258: 3580| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 3583| [45] ["Y-you're right."]
260: 3588| [45] [Indeed. They couldn't just stand there forever.]
261: 3646| [45] [The three kids took Alice Number 2 with them as they headed towards the control room.]
262: 3705| [45] [And after saying that, they left the room.]
