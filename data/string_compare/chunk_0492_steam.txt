  0:  136| [45] [--It was an event that happened long before Natsuhiko's and Miyoko's relationship became strained.]
  1:  141| [45] [A certain day exactly a year after Natsuhiko's father had passed away.]
  2:  146| [45] [After the anniversary of his father's death, Natsuhiko and his mother headed home...]
  3:  203| [45] [Once they had finished visiting his father's grave, Natsuhiko walked through the park with his mother hand in hand.]
  4:  208| [45] [His mother whispered to him in a gentle voice.]
  5:  258| [47] [Miyoko]
  6:  261| [45] ["... Natsuhiko, you were such a good boy today. You didn't even cry once."]
  7:  269| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  272| [45] ["I made up my mind not to cry."]
  9:  280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  283| [45] ["You were good too, Mom. You didn't cry either."]
 11:  309| [47] [Miyoko]
 12:  312| [45] ["Hee hee... I made up my mind not to cry either."]
 13:  338| [47] [Miyoko]
 14:  341| [45] ["I did cry in front of you a year ago, though..."]
 15:  346| [45] [That had been the only time Natsuhiko had seen his mother cry in his life at that point.]
 16:  351| [45] [He wanted to become stronger so he could stop those tears.]
 17:  356| [45] [In place of his strong and gentle father.]
 18:  364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  367| [45] ["... But still, Dad was always smiling."]
 20:  375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  378| [45] ["That's what I loved the most about him."]
 22:  386| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  389| [45] ["Even when he got sick and thin... he never stopped smiling."]
 24:  415| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  418| [45] ["You're right... He never lost his cheerfulness. He was like the sun."]
 26:  472| [45] [She looked to the sky as she said that.]
 27:  477| [45] [And she smiled nostalgically.]
 28:  485| [47] [Miyoko]
 29:  488| [45] ["... Did you know, Natsuhiko? That smile's saved your mother time and time again. Even back when your father and I first met."]
 30:  496| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  499| [45] ["When you first met...?"]
 32:  504| [45] [Now that he thought about it, he had yet to hear his mother talk about how she'd met his father.]
 33:  509| [45] [Ever since he was born, his parents had always been "Mom and Dad" to him, so he never even imagined they had a past he didn't know.]
 34:  514| [45] [He became a little curious and decided to ask her about it.]
 35:  550| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  553| [45] ["Mom, when did you and Dad first meet?"]
 37:  561| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  564| [45] ["It's already been about eight years now, hasn't it...? It was back when I was still at home."]
 39:  572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  575| [45] ["At home?"]
 41:  601| [47] [Miyoko]
 42:  604| [45] ["At the home I was born and raised in."]
 43:  612| [47] [Miyoko]
 44:  615| [45] ["You haven't met them, but I have parents too. I was still living with them."]
 45:  623| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  626| [45] ["I see... So they're grandma and grandpa?"]
 47:  634| [47] [Miyoko]
 48:  637| [45] ["Yes. But... I had a sort of a problem with that family."]
 49:  663| [47] [Miyoko]
 50:  666| [45] ["They were big on formalities, but familial bonds and love... were a little lost on that household."]
 51:  674| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  677| [45] ["So I was forced to live a horribly uncomfortable lifestyle. The only memories I have from childhood are about studying."]
 53:  703| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  706| [45] ["They didn't acknowledge the free will of children... It was like a prison."]
 55:  714| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  717| [45] ["Huh... Is that so...?"]
 57:  722| [45] [His mother's words were difficult to understand, but he somehow understood that she once had it rough.]
 58:  730| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  733| [45] ["... You must've had it tough, Mom..."]
 60:  759| [47] [Miyoko]
 61:  762| [45] ["I loved academics, so I'm grateful to some extent for them sending me to get special education for gifted children, but still..."]
 62:  788| [47] [Miyoko]
 63:  791| [45] ["However, your father saved me from that household."]
 64:  799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65:  802| [45] ["Dad did?"]
 66:  810| [47] [Miyoko]
 67:  813| [45] ["I had already published several papers at that time, and he came to meet me after taking interest in them."]
 68:  839| [47] [Miyoko]
 69:  842| [45] ["When we first met, well... to be honest, he was a little creepy."]
 70:  850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  853| [45] ["Huh, really!?"]
 72:  879| [47] [Miyoko]
 73:  882| [45] ["Well, it kind of felt like he was trying to flirt with me."]
 74:  890| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  893| [45] ["He acted overly familiar, and he'd always joke around... Plus, he'd shower me with absurd amounts of praise over how I was such a beauty of a genius physicist."]
 76:  901| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  904| [45] ["At first, I thought 'What is he trying to do? Didn't he come here out of interest for my papers?'."]
 78:  912| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79:  915| [45] ["Haah... But I guess that's just like Dad, huh?"]
 80:  941| [47] [Miyoko]
 81:  944| [45] ["Indeed. Begrudgingly enough, that's just how he was."]
 82:  949| [45] [She chuckled as she said that.]
 83:  975| [47] [Miyoko]
 84:  978| [45] ["Anyway, that's why I didn't like him at first... but as we talked, I understood how he seriously was interested in my theses."]
 85:  986| [47] [Miyoko]
 86:  989| [45] ["Because he was a Level 4 Communicator, which was a rarity at the time, you see."]
 87:  997| [47] [Miyoko]
 88: 1000| [45] ["He wanted to solve the mysteries of the ability he was born with somehow or another. Including from a physics standpoint."]
 89: 1008| [47] [Miyoko]
 90: 1011| [45] ["I was interested in his ability as well, so we decided to work for a solution together."]
 91: 1019| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1022| [45] ["Um... so you mean you wanted to solve the mystery of Dad's BC?"]
 93: 1048| [47] [Miyoko]
 94: 1051| [45] ["Yes. Because it was a very interesting research topic."]
 95: 1059| [47] [Miyoko]
 96: 1062| [45] ["And as we advanced our research together, we came to talk about various things."]
 97: 1070| [47] [Miyoko]
 98: 1073| [45] ["I still hadn't completely relaxed my guard around him at that time... but I did gradually begin to talk about my family situation."]
 99: 1081| [47] [Miyoko]
100: 1084| [45] ["So what do you think he did? He suddenly cried."]
101: 1092| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1095| [45] ["Huh? Dad cried?"]
103: 1121| [47] [Miyoko]
104: 1124| [45] ["He was somehow empathetic... He had no relatives, so my story actually really left an impression on him, apparently."]
105: 1132| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 1135| [45] ["But there I was, just talking indifferently, and he suddenly started crying. That's just confusing, isn't it?"]
107: 1143| [47] [Miyoko]
108: 1146| [45] ["... My confusion continued for a little while after that."]
109: 1172| [47] [Miyoko]
110: 1175| [45] ["For him to cry at a story like mine was a little... well..."]
111: 1183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1186| [45] ["What?"]
113: 1194| [47] [Miyoko]
114: 1197| [45] ["... It's nothing."]
115: 1223| [47] [Miyoko]
116: 1226| [45] ["In any case, our relationship slightly changed after that. Enough for me to let him read my mind with empathy."]
117: 1234| [47] [Miyoko]
118: 1237| [45] ["And once he learned my innermost thoughts that I hadn't told anybody else, he smiled at me and said 'Don't worry, I'll do something about it'."]
119: 1245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1248| [45] ["Ah, that was Dad's favorite phrase, wasn't it?"]
121: 1274| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 1277| [45] ["It was. Because he was basically a reckless man."]
123: 1285| [47] [Miyoko]
124: 1288| [45] ["But when I saw that smile of his, I oddly felt like I could leave it all up to him."]
125: 1296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1299| [45] ["Yeah, yeah, I can understand."]
127: 1325| [47] [Miyoko]
128: 1328| [45] ["So, skipping all of that confusion... in the end, he took me away from that household by force and made me his bride."]
129: 1336| [47] [Miyoko]
130: 1339| [45] ["I was only 18 when we were married... I was young, in a lot of ways."]
131: 1347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1350| [45] ["I see... Dad was kinda cool, wasn't he?"]
133: 1358| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1361| [45] ["He really was... Looking back, I feel like the day I met your father was the day my life truly began."]
135: 1368| [45] [Miyoko looked at Natsuhiko as she said that.]
136: 1400| [47] [Miyoko]
137: 1403| [45] ["... You know, Natsuhiko... You're the gift that Shun gave me. My most precious treasure."]
138: 1411| [47] [Miyoko]
139: 1414| [45] ["I'm not good with words, so I don't know if I can convey this well, but..."]
140: 1422| [47] [Miyoko]
141: 1425| [45] ["I love you as much as I loved Shun, but in a different way."]
142: 1433| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1436| [45] ["Hmm, that wasn't hard to understand at all."]
144: 1444| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 1447| [45] ["I love you too, Mom. Just like I loved Dad."]
146: 1455| [47] [Miyoko]
147: 1458| [45] ["You're right... I love both of you too."]
148: 1463| [45] [Natsuhiko's mother embraced him gently.]
149: 1468| [45] [Then she grasped his hand and spoke.]
150: 1494| [47] [Miyoko]
151: 1497| [45] ["Now how about we head back home? Our home."]
152: 1505| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 1508| [45] ["Yeah!"]
154: 1514| [45] [Natsuhiko answered cheerfully and walked with his mother.]
155: 1758| [45] [--As I go back through his memories--]
156: 1763| [45] [A certain lump of information energy rises up from some corner of Natsuhiko's brain.]
157: 1768| [45] [That energy then takes form...]
158: 1773| [45] [And manifests as information in Natsuhiko's unconscious mind.]
