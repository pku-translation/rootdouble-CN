  0:   60| [45] [--And then--]
  1:   65| [45] [Another long period of time passed from when Watase had saved those girls.]
  2:   70| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   71| [45] [(This one's... 8 years after that dispatch, huh...)]
  4:   76| [45] [Watase's life as a rescue worker continued after that day.]
  5:   81| [45] [He'd been on more dispatches than he could count and had saved many lives.]
  6:   86| [45] [It was by no means an easy life, but it was one he eventually got used to.]
  7:   91| [45] [Now in his early 30s, he was a man of extremely sound mind that had no disturbances in his life.]
  8:  166| [45] [--It was a warm day.]
  9:  171| [45] [Watase finished his shift and took a walk around the city at dusk with his mind at total peace.]
 10:  176| [45] [There had been a lot of peaceful days like this recently with no dispatches.]
 11:  181| [47] [Watase]
 12:  182| [45] [(Hmm, why do I feel a bit unsatisfied...?)]
 13:  187| [47] [Watase]
 14:  188| [45] [(I mean, I never would have dreamed that there'd ever be days like this back then.)]
 15:  236| [45] [His job and coworkers had supported him all this way.]
 16:  241| [45] [Among those coworkers, there were two of them who had similar backgrounds as Watase.]
 17:  246| [45] [They were "Seiji Dojima" and "Kazuki Hiyama".]
 18:  251| [45] [Much like him, they had also lost family and loved ones in the Great Arson and had been brought up in the city.]
 19:  256| [45] [They had all become rescue workers for similar motives and were all close in age, so the three of them got along very well.]
 20:  261| [45] [He had been blessed with coworkers whom he could pour his heart out to, a job he that was worth doing-- and on top of that, a subordinate who loved him dearly.]
 21:  266| [45] [He'd often been thinking recently that his life wasn't so bad after all.]
 22:  324| [45] [Just as he returned to his apartment and finished changing, his PDA rang.]
 23:  332| [47] [Watase]
 24:  335| [45] ["...?"]
 25:  340| [45] [The display read "Caller Unknown".]
 26:  353| [45] [Watase hesitated for a moment, then picked up the phone.]
 27:  361| [47] [???]
 28:  364| [45] ["Mr. Watase Kasasagi, I presume?"]
 29:  375| [45] [He heard a man's voice on the other end.]
 30:  380| [45] [His voice sounded somewhat mechanical, like it was being filtered through a voice changer.]
 31:  388| [47] [Watase]
 32:  391| [45] ["Umm... who is this?"]
 33:  399| [47] [???]
 34:  402| [45] ["I'm not one to give away my name. The truth is, there is something I'd like to tell you."]
 35:  410| [47] [Watase]
 36:  413| [45] ["Huh? Me?"]
 37:  418| [45] [The man started talking dispassionately just as Watase was ready to fully write this off as a prank.]
 38:  426| [47] [???]
 39:  429| [45] ["I apologize, but we've looked into you."]
 40:  437| [47] [Watase]
 41:  440| [45] ["Huh?"]
 42:  448| [47] [???]
 43:  451| [45] ["Watase Kasasagi, age 31. Lost your family in the 'Great Rokumei City Arson' 15 years ago."]
 44:  459| [47] [???]
 45:  462| [45] ["After that, you were taken under the protection of Rokumei City and moved into municipal housing."]
 46:  470| [47] [???]
 47:  473| [45] ["You enrolled in firefighting school after graduating high school. After graduating that, you were assigned to the Rokumei City Fire Department."]
 48:  481| [47] [???]
 49:  484| [45] ["You quickly stuck out amongst your peers and passed the rescue worker exam two years later. You then enlisted in Sirius..."]
 50:  492| [47] [???]
 51:  495| [45] ["I know it must have been tough for you to lose your family, but you avoided lashing out and grew up to be an honest man."]
 52:  518| [47] [Watase]
 53:  521| [45] ["...!"]
 54:  526| [45] [Shivers ran down Watase's spine.]
 55:  531| [45] [For he didn't know for what reason his caller would run a background check on him.]
 56:  539| [47] [Watase]
 57:  542| [45] ["... What the hell are you, some kind of stalker?"]
 58:  550| [47] [Watase]
 59:  553| [45] ["Stalking other men? You sure have some sick hobbies."]
 60:  561| [47] [???]
 61:  564| [45] ["It's not a hobby. There's a reason I looked into you."]
 62:  572| [47] [???]
 63:  575| [45] ["It's because you're an unfortunate victim of the Great Arson."]
 64:  583| [47] [Watase]
 65:  586| [45] ["... Don't talk about that. I don't want to hear that kind of stuff from other people."]
 66:  594| [47] [???]
 67:  597| [45] ["You are indeed probably tired of hearing people offer their sympathies for the loss of your family. I can understand why you don't want to talk about this--"]
 68:  605| [47] [???]
 69:  608| [45] ["But what if I told you that your family didn't die just because of some arson?"]
 70:  616| [47] [Watase]
 71:  619| [45] ["... What?"]
 72:  624| [45] [Watase gasped.]
 73:  632| [47] [Watase]
 74:  635| [45] ["Hold on, what the hell's that supposed to mean!?"]
 75:  643| [47] [???]
 76:  646| [45] ["Let me make one thing clear in advance. If you learn the truth, your life will probably change forever."]
 77:  669| [47] [Watase]
 78:  672| [45] ["...!"]
 79:  680| [47] [???]
 80:  683| [45] ["If you treasure your current life, then hang up now."]
 81:  691| [47] [???]
 82:  694| [45] ["Then everything will stay the way it is. You can go back to your peaceful life."]
 83:  702| [47] [???]
 84:  705| [45] ["But if you still wish to know the truth-- then come to the ruins of the Old Rokumei City Hospital. Alone."]
 85:  716| [45] [And with those last words, the caller hung up.]
 86:  724| [47] [Watase]
 87:  727| [45] ["H-hey!"]
 88:  732| [45] [There was no response from his PDA no matter how much he yelled at it.]
 89:  792| [45] [Watase stood in a daze for a while in his apartment.]
 90:  797| [47] [Watase]
 91:  798| [45] [(The ruins of the Old Rokumei City Hospital...? What "truth" is he talking about?)]
 92:  806| [47] [Watase]
 93:  809| [45] ["... Dammit..."]
 94:  814| [45] [His desire to know the truth and his desire to keep on living in contentment were at odds in his mind.]
 95:  897| [45] [But Watase eventually made his decision, dashing out of his apartment.]
 96:  966| [45] [It had been 15 years since he'd last visited this place.]
 97:  971| [45] [The place where Wataru had lost her life had apparently been left the way it was for all those years.]
 98:  976| [45] [Probably because it was such a big hospital that demolishing it would cost a sum that no man was willing to pay.]
 99:  981| [45] [There was no sign of anyone in the ruined hospital.]
100:  989| [47] [Watase]
101:  992| [45] ["Hey! Is anyone there!?"]
102:  997| [45] [Watase's shouts simply echoed meaninglessly through the halls.]
103: 1005| [47] [Watase]
104: 1008| [45] ["Tch... so it really was a prank."]
105: 1021| [45] [Overcome with both irritation and relief, Watase was about to leave the ruins--]
106: 1026| [45] [--when he spotted something shining on the ground by the entrance.]
107: 1035| [47] [Watase]
108: 1038| [45] ["... The hell's this?"]
109: 1043| [45] [It was a PDA.]
110: 1048| [45] [He took a close look at it to find that the words "Call in progress" were displayed on its screen.]
111: 1053| [47] [Watase]
112: 1054| [45] ["..."]
113: 1065| [45] [Watase picked up the PDA, a sense of unease weighing on his mind.]
114: 1070| [45] [When he did, he heard the voice of the man who'd called him earlier coming from the speakers.]
115: 1078| [47] [???]
116: 1081| [45] ["Hey there. Looks like you really did come."]
117: 1089| [47] [Watase]
118: 1092| [45] ["So it really was you. Rather roundabout way of pranking people, don't you think?"]
119: 1100| [47] [???]
120: 1103| [45] ["Several problems could possibly arise if you were to see my face. Please forgive me for resorting to this method."]
121: 1111| [47] [Watase]
122: 1114| [45] ["And again, I don't get a word you're saying..."]
123: 1122| [47] [Watase]
124: 1125| [45] ["Well, whatever. Anyway, keep your damn promise and tell me that 'truth' you were mentioning, or whatever."]
125: 1130| [45] [The man started talking in a meek voice.]
126: 1187| [47] [???]
127: 1190| [45] ["--As you know, fires broke out simultaneously in 15 different places in this city on September 16th, 2014."]
128: 1198| [47] [???]
129: 1201| [45] ["That's the event we now call the Great Rokumei City Arson... but there are many unsolved mysteries behind that incident, wouldn't you agree?"]
130: 1209| [47] [Watase]
131: 1212| [45] ["Huh? Well, yeah, that's true..."]
132: 1227| [45] [Watase knew about that too.]
133: 1232| [45] [Most of the information concerning the trials related to the incident had not been made public.]
134: 1237| [45] [The country and Rokumei City had been hounded by the media, but they hadn't gotten much information out of them apart from "the incident was caused by an extremist group".]
135: 1245| [47] [???]
136: 1248| [45] ["They claim the incident to be a kind of terrorist attack committed by a group who aimed to reject Communicators."]
137: 1256| [47] [???]
138: 1259| [45] ["They say they kept the details away from the public to prevent copycat criminals and public unrest from rising up."]
139: 1267| [47] [???]
140: 1270| [45] ["Well, it all adds up... It's a rather simple story to swallow."]
141: 1278| [47] [Watase]
142: 1281| [45] ["... What are you implying?"]
143: 1289| [47] [???]
144: 1292| [45] ["The truth is actually the other way around."]
145: 1300| [47] [???]
146: 1303| [45] ["The extremist group that was arrested were nothing more than scapegoats."]
147: 1311| [47] [???]
148: 1314| [45] ["The incident was actually caused by a lone Communicator."]
149: 1319| [45] [Watase doubted what he heard.]
150: 1327| [47] [Watase]
151: 1330| [45] ["A lone Communicator did that!?"]
152: 1338| [47] [Watase]
153: 1341| [45] ["Don't be ridiculous. How the hell could a single Communicator set fire to 15 separate places in the city all at once?"]
154: 1349| [47] [???]
155: 1352| [45] ["It's possible."]
156: 1360| [47] [???]
157: 1363| [45] ["For the cause of it all was a Communicator who possessed an extraordinary power."]
158: 1371| [47] [Watase]
159: 1374| [45] ["What...?"]
160: 1382| [47] [???]
161: 1385| [45] ["She eventually came to be known as 'Communicator A'."]
162: 1390| [45] [The man began explaining the details about this Communicator in a subdued voice.]
163: 1398| [47] [???]
164: 1401| [45] ["A's real name was Alice Enflamme. She moved to Rokumei City from France 15 years ago."]
165: 1409| [47] [???]
166: 1412| [45] ["At the time, the Rokumei City government was inviting Communicators from all over the world to move to the city."]
167: 1420| [47] [???]
168: 1423| [45] ["They needed human resources for various experiments and studies in order to advance their research in the suddenly valuable field of BC."]
169: 1428| [45] [Watase remembered that.]
170: 1433| [45] [Rokumei City had indeed been doing just that all those years ago.]
171: 1441| [47] [???]
172: 1444| [45] ["They called the one who came from France 'A'."]
173: 1452| [47] [???]
174: 1455| [45] ["A was the first Rank S Aptitude Communicator discovered in the world. That's why she caught Rokumei City's eye."]
175: 1463| [47] [???]
176: 1466| [45] ["A was shown in to the PRC and became a test subject for the study and development of BC abilities."]
177: 1474| [47] [???]
178: 1477| [45] ["Back then, all they knew about BC was that it allowed for abilities to send your voice to a faraway person and to read others' minds--"]
179: 1485| [47] [???]
180: 1488| [45] ["But the PRC discovered the underlying mechanisms of telepathy and empathy through their study of A."]
181: 1496| [47] [???]
182: 1499| [45] ["And through all those experiments, A's own BC abilities developed and grew stronger."]
183: 1507| [47] [???]
184: 1510| [45] ["She became able to use telepathy and empathy freely, their effective ranges grew wider, and her power just kept on growing on and on with no end in sight."]
185: 1518| [47] [???]
186: 1521| [45] ["But if that was all there'd been to it, there wouldn't have been any problems."]
187: 1559| [47] [???]
188: 1562| [45] ["The problem was... that A was both the strongest Communicator there was and the worst criminal there was."]
189: 1567| [45] [When the man said that, a "floral scent" drifted through the air from somewhere.]
190: 1572| [45] [The screen on the PDA then changed.]
191: 1653| [47] [Watase]
192: 1656| [45] ["... What's this?"]
193: 1661| [45] [It appeared to be a magazine article written in a foreign language.]
194: 1667| [45] [There were two pictures there-- one of a burning building, and the other of a beautiful woman.]
195: 1672| [45] [Watase felt like he had seen her somewhere before.]
196: 1681| [47] [???]
197: 1684| [45] ["This is a French gossip magazine article about an incident that occurred in A's hometown in February 2014."]
198: 1692| [47] [???]
199: 1695| [45] ["A, with her tremendous power, was ostracized by the people around her."]
200: 1703| [47] [???]
201: 1706| [45] ["So one day... she set fire to her town to slaughter those who had ostracized her."]
202: 1711| [47] [Watase]
203: 1712| [45] [(Huh...!? I've heard that story somewhere before...)]
204: 1717| [45] [Watase thought about it-- and then remembered.]
205: 1722| [45] [Wataru had told him about it back when she was still alive.]
206: 1791| [47] [Wataru]
207: 1794| [45] ["--Well, the thing is, there've been these BC-related incidents happening from time to time in other countries."]
208: 1799| [45] [And when they were talking--]
209: 1861| [45] [--Watase had seen a blonde woman in the PRC.]
210: 1911| [47] [Watase]
211: 1912| [45] [(No way... Was that woman... Communicator A!?)]
212: 1917| [45] [His memory was fuzzy because it'd happened so long ago, but he had a feeling he was right.%NThe timeframe matched up and everything.]
213: 1922| [45] [The man continued as Watase frowned.]
214: 1930| [47] [???]
215: 1933| [45] ["... In other words, A was simply malice incarnate-- a woman who, on a whim, tried to massacre every person in the city."]
216: 1941| [47] [???]
217: 1944| [45] ["She was pursued by the French authorities, but before they could catch her, she fled to Japan and was sheltered by the PRC."]
218: 1952| [47] [???]
219: 1955| [45] ["Luckily for her, the PRC developed her BC abilities... without ever realizing the true danger they possessed."]
220: 1963| [47] [Watase]
221: 1966| [45] ["What was so dangerous about them?"]
222: 1974| [47] [???]
223: 1977| [45] ["You don't know? BC-- telepathy, that is, isn't just the ability to send your voice to a faraway person."]
224: 1985| [47] [???]
225: 1988| [45] ["You can also send your feelings to others with it."]
226: 1996| [47] [???]
227: 1999| [45] ["In other words, powerful BC could very well change other people's thoughts."]
228: 2007| [47] [Watase]
229: 2010| [45] ["Ah...!"]
230: 2018| [47] [???]
231: 2021| [45] ["So what do you think would happen if someone filled with as much malice as A were to indiscriminately let her thoughts loose on everyone around her?"]
232: 2029| [47] [???]
233: 2032| [45] ["Those thoughts would bring out the 'malice' that lurks in the hearts of every man."]
234: 2040| [47] [???]
235: 2043| [45] ["Her malice would spread to everyone around her like a virulent disease."]
236: 2051| [47] [???]
237: 2054| [45] ["... Now you understand just how dangerous it is, don't you?"]
238: 2077| [47] [Watase]
239: 2080| [45] ["...!"]
240: 2085| [45] [Watase was rendered speechless.]
241: 2090| [45] [He just silently continued to listen to the man.]
242: 2098| [47] [???]
243: 2101| [45] ["The researchers at the PRC raised an ordinary criminal into a bona-fide monster."]
244: 2109| [47] [???]
245: 2112| [45] ["The researchers realized how dangerous A was far too late and set up surveillance to keep her from wandering out into the city--"]
246: 2120| [47] [???]
247: 2123| [45] ["But on September 16th, 2014, A escaped from the facility."]
248: 2131| [47] [Watase]
249: 2134| [45] ["Escaped... then you mean she...!"]
250: 2267| [47] [???]
251: 2270| [45] ["Yes, A spread her malice-laced thoughts all throughout the city that night."]
252: 2278| [47] [???]
253: 2281| [45] ["Those thoughts influenced the minds of the people of Rokumei City in some way."]
254: 2289| [47] [???]
255: 2292| [45] ["This caused the already high levels of malice held by would-be criminals to spike through the roof--"]
256: 2424| [47] [???]
257: 2427| [45] ["And led them to setting the city on fire."]
258: 2435| [47] [???]
259: 2438| [45] ["This is the truth behind the 'Great Rokumei City Arson'."]
260: 2443| [45] [The man declared all of that in a clear voice.]
261: 2517| [47] [Watase]
262: 2518| [45] [(... It can't be...!?)]
263: 2523| [45] [Watase noticed that his hands had started shaking.]
264: 2528| [47] [Watase]
265: 2529| [45] [(He's saying a single woman became the trigger behind the incident...!?)]
266: 2564| [45] [The story was sudden and difficult to believe, but the man spoke in an unwaveringly serious voice, leaving no room for doubt.]
267: 2569| [45] [Watase remained silent as the man continued.]
268: 2577| [47] [???]
269: 2580| [45] ["... This was a scandal for the PRC, and consequently, a scandal for the Rokumei City government, the ones managing the PRC."]
270: 2588| [47] [???]
271: 2591| [45] ["But they won't admit to that."]
272: 2599| [47] [???]
273: 2602| [45] ["Rokumei City hid the truth behind the incident along with the existence of A."]
274: 2610| [47] [???]
275: 2613| [45] ["A was taken back to the PRC in absolute secrecy and confined in a basement of sorts again."]
276: 2670| [47] [???]
277: 2673| [45] ["In the meantime, LABO was constructed on the outskirts of the city. Once it was completed,%NA was transferred from the PRC to LABO."]
278: 2681| [47] [Watase]
279: 2684| [45] ["Wha... why LABO?"]
280: 2692| [47] [Watase]
281: 2695| [45] ["That's a nuclear research facility, isn't it? Why would they send a Communicator there--?"]
282: 2703| [47] [???]
283: 2706| [45] ["No, LABO is no nuclear research facility. It's actually a BC research facility."]
284: 2714| [47] [Watase]
285: 2717| [45] ["Impossible! I never heard anything about that!"]
286: 2735| [47] [???]
287: 2738| [45] ["Of course not. It's this city's biggest secret."]
288: 2746| [47] [???]
289: 2749| [45] ["But don't you think it's strange? There are many hurdles you have to overcome to create a new nuclear reactor."]
290: 2757| [47] [???]
291: 2760| [45] ["You have to clear strict construction standards and legal problems, then make the necessary arrangements with the city council-- yet all of those conditions were cleared quickly and LABO was built."]
292: 2768| [47] [???]
293: 2771| [45] ["Why was LABO able to easily overcome those hurdles and get built in the first place?"]
294: 2779| [47] [???]
295: 2782| [45] ["The answer is simple: it's because LABO doesn't actually have a nuclear reactor. Because it's a BC research facility, not a nuclear research facility."]
296: 2805| [47] [Watase]
297: 2808| [45] ["...!"]
298: 2813| [45] [--The "common sense" Watase had thought to be true up until this point was gradually being rewritten.]
299: 2818| [45] [The man waited a moment for Watase to respond, then continued.]
300: 2826| [47] [???]
301: 2829| [45] ["But the one problem that stood in their way was the sentiments of the townspeople."]
302: 2837| [47] [???]
303: 2840| [45] ["Their antipathy towards nuclear power was overwhelming, as you'd expect."]
304: 2848| [47] [???]
305: 2851| [45] ["But the city explained to the civilians that 'the implementation of truly safe nuclear power is essential to Japan now that our natural resources are drying up'--"]
306: 2859| [47] [???]
307: 2862| [45] ["Which led to the townspeople finally accepting their decision."]
308: 2867| [45] [Watase remembered the turmoil of that time.]
309: 2872| [45] [Watase had been 18 years old at the time, but as he had just enrolled in firefighting school, he hadn't had much of a reaction to all the fuss other than "well, guess the city's gotta do what it's gotta do".]
310: 2880| [47] [???]
311: 2883| [45] ["... But that series of events was all a cover."]
312: 2891| [47] [???]
313: 2894| [45] ["Everyone was opposed to 'nuclear power', but no one suspected that LABO was actually a%N'BC research facility'."]
314: 2902| [47] [???]
315: 2905| [45] ["And they used the dangers and confidentiality of nuclear power research as a pretext to successfully keep the townspeople far away from LABO."]
316: 2913| [47] [Watase]
317: 2916| [45] ["So you mean the guys behind Rokumei City even used the townspeople's feelings of opposition to their advantage...!?"]
318: 2924| [47] [Watase]
319: 2927| [45] ["That's something no person should be allowed to do!"]
320: 2935| [47] [???]
321: 2938| [45] ["That is of trivial importance to the people of LABO. Their only moral code is to take the best possible actions for their research."]
322: 2946| [47] [Watase]
323: 2949| [45] ["No way..."]
324: 2957| [47] [???]
325: 2960| [45] ["At any rate, LABO was then completed."]
326: 2968| [47] [???]
327: 2971| [45] ["And it's no ordinary research facility either. It's also a facility for keeping dangerous Communicators like A locked up."]
328: 2979| [47] [???]
329: 2982| [45] ["There's a residential area of sorts deep beneath LABO. That's where they confined A."]
330: 2990| [47] [Watase]
331: 2993| [45] ["W... wait! Wasn't A put on trial?"]
332: 3001| [47] [Watase]
333: 3004| [45] ["Why would Rokumei City shelter A after all she did!?"]
334: 3012| [47] [???]
335: 3015| [45] ["It's obvious."]
336: 3023| [47] [???]
337: 3026| [45] ["It was so that they could keep on using A as a lab rat after she had caused that huge incident!"]
338: 3034| [47] [Watase]
339: 3037| [45] ["What!?"]
340: 3045| [47] [???]
341: 3048| [45] ["The Rokumei City government and the PRC would be forced to take responsibility were the truth behind the incident to ever come to light."]
342: 3056| [47] [???]
343: 3059| [45] ["So the people behind Rokumei City figured they should cover the whole incident up and continue the research in another location."]
344: 3067| [47] [???]
345: 3070| [45] ["Thus Communicator A came to be known as 'Subject A' from that day onwards and participated in LABO's BC ability research and development."]
346: 3078| [47] [???]
347: 3081| [45] ["Meanwhile, with the PRC having served its purpose, it was turned into a mere dummy facility."]
348: 3089| [47] [???]
349: 3092| [45] ["The results of the BC research secretly conducted at LABO are published through the PRC."]
350: 3100| [47] [???]
351: 3103| [45] ["That way, no one would suspect LABO was a BC research center. And thus, their perfect cover-up system was completed."]
352: 3111| [47] [???]
353: 3114| [45] ["Both LABO and the PRC are government managed facilities. Trace them back to their source and you'll find that they're all closely connected, under the jurisdiction of Rokumei City."]
354: 3119| [47] [Watase]
355: 3120| [45] ["--..."]
356: 3125| [45] [Watase thought things over as calmly as possible, despite the agitation causing his insides to tremble.]
357: 3130| [45] [He wanted to make sure there weren't any inconsistencies in what the man was saying.]
358: 3138| [47] [Watase]
359: 3141| [45] ["... No, hold on..."]
360: 3149| [47] [Watase]
361: 3152| [45] ["Is that really all there is to it? When you think about it normally, wouldn't someone in on the whole thing have tried to stop that whole chain of events?"]
362: 3160| [47] [???]
363: 3163| [45] ["They didn't. You see, back then, Rokumei City was all about focusing their efforts into BC research."]
364: 3171| [47] [???]
365: 3174| [45] ["I think you remember this too, but Japan was showing signs of being in an economic and industrial deadlock back in those days."]
366: 3182| [47] [???]
367: 3185| [45] ["And then new 'technology' known as BC showed up right there and then."]
368: 3193| [47] [???]
369: 3196| [45] ["The guys behind Rokumei City bet on that possibility and pressed forward with their BC technological development, even if it meant pushing every obstacle in their way aside."]
370: 3204| [47] [Watase]
371: 3207| [45] ["What did they have to gain from that...!?"]
372: 3215| [47] [???]
373: 3218| [45] ["All of their advanced technology has the potential to earn them riches beyond your wildest dreams."]
374: 3226| [47] [???]
375: 3229| [45] ["BC is genuinely new technology that no one else in the world has invested in."]
376: 3237| [47] [???]
377: 3240| [45] ["If Japan beat the rest of the world to the punch in its research, that'd put them in the top of that field."]
378: 3248| [47] [???]
379: 3251| [45] ["The fact is that telepathy can be applied to the field of psychiatry..."]
380: 3259| [47] [???]
381: 3262| [45] ["... while empathy has nearly countless potential uses. It could be used for secret intelligence gathering in all sorts of fields, like industry, politics, and the military."]
382: 3270| [47] [???]
383: 3273| [45] ["Thus, those involved built a system based on their new interests and grew obsessed with doing whatever it took to protect those interests, even if it meant covering up anything inconvenient for them."]
384: 3281| [47] [???]
385: 3284| [45] ["And you're yet another victim of those efforts.."]
386: 3292| [47] [Watase]
387: 3295| [45] ["I am!?"]
388: 3303| [47] [???]
389: 3306| [45] ["118 people died in the Great Rokumei City Arson."]
390: 3314| [47] [???]
391: 3317| [45] ["The bereaved families of the victims were given courteous patronage and granted assistance with their lives, moving on to college, and finding jobs."]
392: 3325| [47] [???]
393: 3328| [45] ["There are many others like you who were given homes in public housing and became civil servants."]
394: 3336| [47] [???]
395: 3339| [45] ["But don't you find that strange? Why would a simple local government go so far in taking the bereaved families of the victims into consideration?"]
396: 3347| [47] [???]
397: 3350| [45] ["Their goal was to take the bereaved families under the city's wing and keep a close eye on how they developed from there."]
398: 3358| [47] [Watase]
399: 3361| [45] ["That... that can't be...!"]
400: 3369| [47] [???]
401: 3372| [45] ["Having trouble believing it? Well, I don't blame you. Then I'll send you some documents we've obtained."]
402: 3380| [47] [???]
403: 3383| [45] ["Take a look at them and decide for yourself if what I'm saying is true."]
404: 3388| [45] [An e-mail with an attachment was sent to the PDA right after the man said that.]
405: 3393| [47] [Watase]
406: 3394| [45] [(...?)]
407: 3405| [45] [Watase opened the e-mail and checked the contents of the file.]
408: 3410| [45] [They were various documents that supported the man's claims.]
409: 3453| [45] ["A photo of LABO's interior"--]
410: 3458| [45] [This showed that LABO was no nuclear power research center.]
411: 3463| [45] ["A photo of an e-mail sent from LABO to the PRC"--]
412: 3468| [45] [This e-mail proved that a "BC insulator" that LABO had developed was publicly announced as something from the PRC.]
413: 3473| [45] ["Subject A's Data"--]
414: 3478| [45] [A lot of the data in this one had been deleted, but what remained did confirm that LABO had indeed confined a Communicator called that.]
415: 3483| [45] [All sorts of other documents were there, each one supporting the idea that what the man had said was true.]
416: 3526| [45] [So when he finished reading all of it-- Watase muttered in a stunned voice.]
417: 3534| [47] [Watase]
418: 3537| [45] ["... Is what you're telling me... really true...!?"]
419: 3545| [47] [???]
420: 3548| [45] ["It is. Though it must not be easy to believe, nor is it something you would want to believe."]
421: 3556| [47] [???]
422: 3559| [45] ["But think back on how abnormal this city is. They control information and conduct surveillance on their townspeople without batting an eye, right?"]
423: 3567| [47] [???]
424: 3570| [45] ["Anything's possible in this city, no matter how unbelievable it may sound."]
425: 3575| [45] [Watase was taken aback at those words.]
426: 3580| [45] [The city had grown to do all sorts of things that would normally be considered a violation of human rights on the supposed grounds that Rokumei City was a "government designated top secret city".]
427: 3634| [45] [Such as setting up surveillance cameras all over the city.]
428: 3686| [45] [The city gates that controlled the coming and going of townspeople.]
429: 3691| [45] [The citizen database that only certain people were allowed to access...]
430: 3706| [45] [The townspeople had been opposed to the creation of every single one of them.]
431: 3711| [45] [But their complaints eventually died down, and the security cameras and so on were implemented little by little--]
432: 3716| [45] [And before they knew it, all those things had become like air to the townspeople.]
433: 3721| [45] [No, the townspeople had simply "gotten used" to those abnormalities.]
434: 3741| [47] [Watase]
435: 3742| [45] [(...)]
436: 3747| [45] [Watase felt chills run through him when it hit him just how strange the whole thing was.]
437: 3752| [45] [Since it wasn't directly related to them, no one had thought about it seriously.]
438: 3757| [45] [And thus all sorts of things that couldn't be undone had gone forward without him even noticing it.]
439: 3765| [47] [Watase]
440: 3768| [45] ["... So what are you saying...!?"]
441: 3776| [47] [Watase]
442: 3779| [45] ["My family... died because of that monster built up by the Rokumei City government and the PRC..."]
443: 3787| [47] [Watase]
444: 3790| [45] ["Yet at the time, the Rokumei City government hid their crimes and never took responsibility..."]
445: 3799| [47] [Watase]
446: 3802| [45] ["And... I received money from that very same government and lived a comfortable life up until today without knowing a damn thing...!?"]
447: 3810| [47] [???]
448: 3813| [45] ["Unfortunately, that's exactly it."]
449: 3821| [47] [???]
450: 3824| [45] ["You were raised by the government responsible for your family's deaths and have been working for them as a civil servant."]
451: 3904| [47] [Watase]
452: 3907| [45] ["--!!"]
453: 3912| [45] [Watase let out a wordless scream.]
454: 3917| [45] [His blood boiled and a deep red filled his vision.]
455: 3925| [47] [Watase]
456: 3928| [45] ["F-f... fuck that!!"]
457: 3936| [47] [Watase]
458: 3939| [45] ["What happened to Subject A!? Is she still living in LABO!?"]
459: 3947| [47] [???]
460: 3950| [45] ["No, she died."]
461: 3958| [47] [Watase]
462: 3961| [45] ["W... what...!?"]
463: 3969| [47] [???]
464: 3972| [45] ["After causing that incident, A was used by LABO as a human test subject-- and then died there just a year after she'd been confined."]
465: 3980| [47] [???]
466: 3983| [45] ["She probably died a cruel death. In the end, A too was nothing more than a victim of Rokumei City's wrongdoings."]
467: 3991| [47] [Watase]
468: 3994| [45] ["..."]
469: 3999| [45] [A sense of emptiness filled Watase's body.]
470: 4004| [45] [Having immediately lost the target of his hatred-- he switched it over to a new one.]
471: 4012| [47] [Watase]
472: 4015| [45] ["What happened with the Rokumei City government... after that?"]
473: 4023| [47] [Watase]
474: 4026| [45] ["What happened with LABO after they lost their valuable test subject due to A's death?"]
475: 4064| [47] [???]
476: 4067| [45] ["They abducted new test subjects and used them to continue their BC research."]
477: 4072| [45] [A floral scent filled the air yet again at that moment.]
478: 4080| [47] [???]
479: 4083| [45] ["Out of all the Communicators who live in Rokumei City-- those who possess particularly superb abilities are confined in LABO and made into test subjects."]
480: 4091| [47] [???]
481: 4094| [45] ["And so more monsters like A have been growing in number one by one."]
482: 4102| [47] [Watase]
483: 4105| [45] ["Why would they ever do something like that!?"]
484: 4113| [47] [???]
485: 4116| [45] ["One of their goals is, naturally, to study BC."]
486: 4124| [47] [???]
487: 4127| [45] ["And the other one... is to create a kind of biological weapon."]
488: 4135| [47] [Watase]
489: 4138| [45] ["Did you say... a biological weapon!?"]
490: 4146| [47] [???]
491: 4149| [45] ["The incident with A was merely an accident, but if you look at it from another angle, you'll find that Communicators who have become monsters can be used in interesting ways."]
492: 4157| [47] [???]
493: 4160| [45] ["For example, let's say you send one of them into the capital of an enemy nation."]
494: 4168| [47] [???]
495: 4171| [45] ["What do you think would happen next?"]
496: 4179| [47] [Watase]
497: 4182| [45] ["They'd amplify the malice of the city's residents... leading to mass chaos and destruction...?"]
498: 4190| [47] [???]
499: 4193| [45] ["Precisely. They could intentionally cause the same thing that happened in Rokumei City 15 years ago."]
500: 4201| [47] [???]
501: 4204| [45] ["If left alone for a few days, arson and crimes would spread through the whole city, criminals would run rampant, and public order would likely be impossible to restore."]
502: 4212| [47] [???]
503: 4215| [45] ["But the attacked party wouldn't even realize that they'd been attacked."]
504: 4223| [47] [???]
505: 4226| [45] ["For the core concept behind this biological weapon is that it devastates people's minds."]
506: 4234| [47] [???]
507: 4237| [45] ["A weapon that only damages a country's citizens without actually damaging the country itself. Truly a weapon of the new era."]
508: 4245| [47] [Watase]
509: 4248| [45] ["But isn't Rokumei City just a local government!? What would drive them to do that!?"]
510: 4256| [47] [???]
511: 4259| [45] ["The truth is, the Rokumei City government has this intimate relationship with a certain foreign company."]
512: 4267| [47] [???]
513: 4270| [45] ["On the outside, they're just a pharmaceutical company, but behind the facade, they're an arms dealer. Merchants of death, as the term goes."]
514: 4278| [47] [???]
515: 4281| [45] ["Almost all of the sinister research being carried out is done at their request."]
516: 4289| [47] [???]
517: 4292| [45] ["... But no one's realized this. So there's no one who can talk about or leak this."]
518: 4300| [47] [???]
519: 4303| [45] ["The truth will forever continue to be covered-up and vanish into the deepest darkness."]
520: 4311| [47] [Watase]
521: 4314| [45] ["... I see..."]
522: 4322| [47] [Watase]
523: 4325| [45] ["So Rokumei City..."]
524: 4333| [47] [Watase]
525: 4336| [45] ["... is trying to create more of those monsters responsible for Wataru and our parents' deaths...!"]
526: 4371| [45] [Flames of rage burned up within Watase.]
527: 4376| [45] [He sealed those pitch black flames deep within his chest and continued.]
528: 4384| [47] [Watase]
529: 4387| [45] ["Hey, lemme ask you something... What do you gain from telling me all this?"]
530: 4395| [47] [Watase]
531: 4398| [45] ["What do you want me to do...?"]
532: 4406| [47] [???]
533: 4409| [45] ["Let me reverse the question. What do -you- want to do?"]
534: 4432| [47] [Watase]
535: 4435| [45] ["..."]
536: 4443| [47] [???]
537: 4446| [45] ["Watase Kasasagi, I ask this straight to your heart. Now that you know the truth, can you return to that false peace?"]
538: 4454| [47] [???]
539: 4457| [45] ["Tell me your true feelings."]
540: 4525| [45] [Watase's heart pounded loudly at that request.]
541: 4530| [47] [Watase]
542: 4531| [45] [(Can I keep on living the same carefree life now that I know the truth...!?)]
543: 4589| [45] [The Rokumei City government had killed his sister and parents, twisted his life--]
544: 4594| [45] [And on top of all that, they'd hidden the truth and forced him to live an unknowing lie for 15 years.]
545: 4646| [45] [Watase had pushed his hatred of the culprit of the incident into the deepest corners of his heart by following his sister's dream.]
546: 4651| [45] [But the truth was, there was a certain desire he'd secretly held all these years.]
547: 4669| [47] [Watase]
548: 4672| [45] ["... I..."]
549: 4680| [47] [Watase]
550: 4683| [45] ["... I wanted to make the culprit go through the same pain Wataru did."]
551: 4691| [47] [???]
552: 4694| [45] ["Ah yes, Wataru was your sister, correct?"]
553: 4702| [47] [Watase]
554: 4705| [45] ["... Yeah."]
555: 4788| [47] [Watase]
556: 4791| [45] ["She... she was such a good person..."]
557: 4799| [47] [Watase]
558: 4802| [45] ["She was weak, but motivated... Stupid, but gentle...!"]
559: 4818| [45] [Tears poured out of Watase's eyes when he said that.]
560: 4823| [45] [--Watase loved Wataru.]
561: 4828| [45] [He hated the one who had taken her away from him forever from the bottom of his heart.]
562: 4833| [45] [But everything about the culprit, including her very existence, had been concealed by the Rokumei City government.]
563: 4838| [45] [If possible, he would've very much liked to tear A limb from limb, but that was no longer an option.]
564: 4843| [45] [Then that left the Rokumei City government as the only target for Watase's hatred and anger.]
565: 4851| [47] [Watase]
566: 4854| [45] ["... Hey..."]
567: 4862| [47] [Watase]
568: 4865| [45] ["Should I feel ashamed... about wanting revenge...?"]
569: 4870| [47] [???]
570: 4871| [45] ["..."]
571: 4879| [47] [Watase]
572: 4882| [45] ["... Is it okay for me to want revenge... when it's my job to save lives?"]
573: 4890| [47] [Watase]
574: 4893| [45] ["Is it okay for me to hate the bastards running Rokumei City?"]
575: 4901| [47] [???]
576: 4904| [45] ["Of course."]
577: 4909| [45] [The man's answer was clear and blunt.]
578: 4917| [47] [???]
579: 4920| [45] ["It's only human... for you to hate your family's killer."]
580: 4928| [47] [???]
581: 4931| [45] ["And if you truly feel that way--"]
582: 4939| [47] [???]
583: 4942| [45] ["Then you can become one of us. Our comrade."]
584: 4953| [45] [Watase heard footsteps coming from behind at that moment.]
585: 4976| [47] [Watase]
586: 4979| [45] ["!!"]
587: 4984| [45] [Watase turned around in surprise--]
588: 5008| [45] [--only to see a man standing there.]
589: 5013| [45] [Judging from the fact that he was holding a PDA, he had likely been the one talking to Watase just now.]
590: 5021| [47] [Watase]
591: 5024| [45] ["Wh-who are you...!?"]
592: 5032| [47] [Ukita]
593: 5035| [45] ["Me? I'm a researcher at LABO."]
594: 5040| [45] [The man put his PDA away and answered.]
595: 5078| [47] [Ukita]
596: 5081| [45] ["But I too hate LABO and Rokumei City, much like you."]
597: 5089| [47] [Watase]
598: 5092| [45] ["What...!?"]
599: 5097| [45] [A whistleblower-- that term passed through Watase's head.]
600: 5102| [45] [He'd sent him pictures of LABO and data about the test subject just minutes ago.]
601: 5107| [45] [Only someone on the inside could have obtained those things.]
602: 5115| [47] [Watase]
603: 5118| [45] ["But what did you mean by 'become one of us'... No, wait, what do you mean by 'us'?"]
604: 5144| [47] [Ukita]
605: 5147| [45] ["You see, while I work as a researcher for LABO, I am also a member of a certain organization."]
606: 5155| [47] [Watase]
607: 5158| [45] ["What organization?"]
608: 5166| [47] [Ukita]
609: 5169| [45] ["The extremist organization who was arrested for the Great Arson 15 years ago."]
610: 5177| [47] [Ukita]
611: 5180| [45] ["The ones who were branded as criminals instead of Communicator A."]
612: 5203| [47] [Watase]
613: 5206| [45] ["--!"]
614: 5211| [45] [Watase was astonished.]
615: 5219| [47] [Watase]
616: 5222| [45] ["Wait, do you mean... you guys are terrorists!?"]
617: 5248| [47] [Ukita]
618: 5251| [45] ["Terrorists, huh? It's true that those who stand up against authority have been frequently called by that term."]
619: 5259| [47] [Watase]
620: 5262| [45] ["Quit mincing words! What you guys do is commit acts of destruction, plain and simple!"]
621: 5270| [47] [Watase]
622: 5273| [45] ["You're the ones who set up bombs at the PRC before, weren't you!? All you've done is give us that much more work to do--"]
623: 5299| [47] [Ukita]
624: 5302| [45] ["Hold on! It's not like I'm a member of this extremist organization because I want to be!"]
625: 5310| [47] [Ukita]
626: 5313| [45] ["There's just no other organization out there who I can count on to oppose Rokumei City.%NThat's all there is to it."]
627: 5321| [47] [Watase]
628: 5324| [45] ["What...? But can't you just tell the police to..."]
629: 5350| [47] [Ukita]
630: 5353| [45] ["Won't work. Considering the fact that they've been able to keep such a large-scale cover-up running for so long, it's best to assume Rokumei City has the police in their pocket."]
631: 5379| [47] [Ukita]
632: 5382| [45] ["And when you look at how much information control is going on, that leaves the media out of the picture too."]
633: 5408| [47] [Ukita]
634: 5411| [45] ["And before you suggest standing up to them by myself, that's out of the question too. Someone tried that once, and they got murdered in a way that looked like an accident."]
635: 5419| [47] [Ukita]
636: 5422| [45] ["But despite all that, I want to reveal the truth...!"]
637: 5430| [47] [Ukita]
638: 5433| [45] ["I want to bring LABO's wrongdoings to light, even if it means making an enemy of the entire city!"]
639: 5441| [47] [Watase]
640: 5444| [45] ["Wh... why are you going so far!?"]
641: 5470| [47] [Ukita]
642: 5473| [45] ["Much like you, I also have a reason to fight."]
643: 5481| [47] [Ukita]
644: 5484| [45] ["You should understand by now why I told you all this."]
645: 5492| [47] [Ukita]
646: 5495| [45] ["My comrades and I are currently formulating a plan to deal a crippling blow to Rokumei City and LABO."]
647: 5503| [47] [Ukita]
648: 5506| [45] ["And we need your help to carry out this plan."]
649: 5514| [47] [Watase]
650: 5517| [45] ["You need... me?"]
651: 5543| [47] [Ukita]
652: 5546| [45] ["You're free to refuse, of course."]
653: 5572| [47] [Ukita]
654: 5575| [45] ["If you then proceed to go to the police and tell them everything you've just heard, I will most likely be arrested as a terrorist."]
655: 5601| [47] [Ukita]
656: 5604| [45] ["Though perhaps LABO will get to me before the police can, and kill me."]
657: 5612| [47] [Watase]
658: 5615| [45] ["..."]
659: 5641| [47] [Ukita]
660: 5644| [45] ["I'm taking a huge risk by showing you my face and telling you all about my background."]
661: 5652| [47] [Ukita]
662: 5655| [45] ["But I'd like to believe that you'll become one of our comrades..."]
663: 5663| [47] [Ukita]
664: 5666| [45] ["I want to believe that all the things you said about your deceased sister just minutes ago were true."]
665: 5690| [45] [The man then looked Watase dead in the eye.]
666: 5716| [47] [Ukita]
667: 5719| [45] ["You can still turn back now. You can forget everything and return to your normal life."]
668: 5727| [47] [Ukita]
669: 5730| [45] ["But if you want to fight Rokumei City alongside us--"]
670: 5756| [47] [Ukita]
671: 5759| [45] ["Then become one of us."]
672: 5764| [45] [Watase looked the man back in the eye.]
673: 5769| [45] [After a long silence, he finally answered.]
674: 5777| [47] [Watase]
675: 5780| [45] ["... What's the name of your organization?"]
676: 5806| [47] [Ukita]
677: 5809| [45] ["--Q."]
678: 5817| [47] [Ukita]
679: 5820| [45] ["We are the ones who pose the unrelenting questions to this insidious world."]
680: 5852| [45] [--Natsuhiko was shocked about the memory he'd just seen.]
681: 5932| [47] [Natsuhiko]
682: 5933| [45] [(I see... so that's why Watase hates Communicators so much...!)]
683: 5964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
684: 5965| [45] [(And now I know that it was Mr. Ukita who led Watase down the path of evil...!)]
685: 5970| [45] [He'd had his suspicions for a while, but now he knew for sure that Ukita was also a terrorist.]
686: 6034| [47] [Natsuhiko]
687: 6035| [45] [(But... Mr. Ukita and Watase are making a grave misunderstanding.)]
688: 6115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
689: 6116| [45] [(Yuuri was a test subject, but she never turned into a monster!)]
690: 6180| [47] [Natsuhiko]
691: 6181| [45] [(Communicator A may indeed have been a dangerous being--)]
692: 6186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
693: 6187| [45] [(But LABO as it is now isn't creating any monsters!)]
694: 6192| [47] [Natsuhiko]
695: 6193| [45] [(And of course, there's no way in hell that absurd story about them creating biological weapons is true, either...!)]
696: 6198| [45] [Then that meant Watase's descent into terrorism was most likely all based on a misunderstanding.]
697: 6203| [45] [The more of Watase's memories he saw, the stronger the pain in Natsuhiko's heart grew.]
698: 6208| [45] [But he kept on viewing those memories to learn the truth.]
699: 6262| [45] [And so the next memory to appear--]
700: 6267| [45] [--was an event that took place exactly one month later.]
