  0:   51| [55] [√After Chapter 1]
  1:   65| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Yuuri immediately began searching Area 3's inner ring.]
  2:   70| [45] [--They first ran into the nearest room.]
  3:  129| [45] [It was a somewhat large laboratory.]
  4:  134| [45] [Deeper inside was a space that seemed to be for a rest area, a guardsroom, or possibly a conference room.]
  5:  160| [47] [Kazami]
  6:  163| [45] ["All right, commence the search! We have one minute!"]
  7:  171| [47] [Watase]
  8:  174| [45] ["Yeah!"]
  9:  201| [47] [Yuuri]
 10:  204| [45] ["Y-yes!"]
 11:  263| [45] [The group split up and searched the room.]
 12:  268| [45] [Though they didn't find the survivors or a medical box there, something still caught their eyes.]
 13:  279| [47] [Watase]
 14:  280| [45] [(Hmm?)]
 15:  285| [45] [A notepad was lying on the floor.]
 16:  290| [45] [Something had been hastily scribbled on it.]
 17:  328| [85] [　%N　%N　%N　%N]
 18:  331| [45] ["9/18  sprinkler system inspection"]
 19:  334| [85] [　]
 20:  337| [45] [The inspectors (Takashita, Urabe, Misono) will gather in the engine room at 1 PM.]
 21:  340| [45] [* Make sure that the system's been manually shut off before the inspection.]
 22:  369| [47] [Watase]
 23:  372| [45] ["... The sprinkler system? Could this inspection be the reason why it's not online?"]
 24:  377| [45] [Kazami ran up to him and took a look at the note.]
 25:  439| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  442| [45] ["No, the date's wrong. Today's September 16th--"]
 27:  468| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  471| [45] ["But perhaps we'll find out why the sprinkler system's offline if we go to this 'engine room'."]
 29:  479| [47] [Watase]
 30:  482| [45] ["Do you know where it is?"]
 31:  490| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  493| [45] ["Negative. I can only hope we find it in our future search."]
 33:  498| [45] [But though they hadn't gained much information, it was still progress.]
 34:  506| [47] [Watase]
 35:  509| [45] ["All right, next room!"]
 36:  514| [45] [The group finished up their search of the room in precisely one minute, then headed for the next one.]
 37:  562| [45] [They entered the hallway and went next door.]
 38:  621| [45] [But what they found was no ordinary room, but rather an elevator hall.]
 39:  626| [45] [The survivors were nowhere to be found, and all the elevator lights were off.]
 40:  688| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  691| [45] ["So it appears that all the elevators in this facility are disabled, not just Area 1 and 2's."]
 42:  718| [47] [Yuuri]
 43:  721| [45] ["Um, couldn't we climb up the elevator shaft to get to the surface...?"]
 44:  747| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  750| [45] ["Unfortunately, there's a bulkhead in the shafts at the section that leads to the surface."]
 46:  758| [47] [Watase]
 47:  761| [45] ["That's also gotta be part of the radiation leakage prevention system...!"]
 48:  766| [45] [With the elevators out, the group had no choice but to move on.]
 49:  809| [45] [Their next destination was the connecting passageway that led to Area 4.]
 50:  857| [45] [But it was buried in a mountain of rubble.]
 51:  865| [47] [Watase]
 52:  868| [45] ["This rubble... was it created by the explosions that occurred before the meltdown?"]
 53:  930| [47] [Kazami]
 54:  933| [45] ["Most likely."]
 55:  960| [47] [Yuuri]
 56:  963| [45] ["... I don't think we can get past it."]
 57:  968| [45] [Though they'd finally gotten their hands on a Level 4 card, it meant nothing in the face of this.]
 58:  973| [45] [It appeared they'd need to find another way into Area 4.]
 59:  999| [47] [Kazami]
 60: 1002| [45] ["There's no point in standing around here! Let's move on!"]
 61: 1045| [45] [The group went back to Area 3 and headed towards Area N this time.]
 62: 1088| [45] [And when they got to the Area N connecting passageway--]
 63: 1093| [45] [they were greeted by a door, with a security terminal stationed next to it.]
 64: 1098| [45] [The words "Lv. N" were engraved on the terminal.]
 65: 1106| [47] [Watase]
 66: 1109| [45] ["Level N...?"]
 67: 1171| [47] [Kazami]
 68: 1174| [45] ["It would seem that you need a special card to get into Area N."]
 69: 1179| [45] [Perhaps Area N had the highest security level in LABO.]
 70: 1184| [45] [But it was the fires blazing just beyond that gate that kept them from freedom.]
 71: 1192| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1195| [45] ["... Would it be possible to enter Area N and put out the fires?"]
 73: 1221| [47] [Kazami]
 74: 1224| [45] ["Are you out of your mind!? That's way too dangerous!"]
 75: 1250| [47] [Kazami]
 76: 1253| [45] ["Even if you could put out the fires, you wouldn't be able to protect yourself from getting exposed to the lethal radiation levels in there."]
 77: 1261| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1264| [45] ["You're right! Dammit...!"]
 79: 1300| [45] [Watase tried putting his Procyon close to the gate--]
 80: 1314| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1317| [45] ["... Wha!?"]
 82: 1322| [45] [only for the reading to start shooting up astronomically.]
 83: 1330| [47] [Watase]
 84: 1333| [45] ["'2406 mSv'!?"]
 85: 1366| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1369| [45] ["It almost went up by a thousand all at once--!"]
 87: 1402| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1405| [45] ["It's too dangerous! Fall back!!"]
 89: 1413| [47] [Watase]
 90: 1416| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
 91: 1481| [45] [The group frantically ran away from the door.]
 92: 1486| [45] [Just then, the Procyon's reading went back to normal.]
 93: 1494| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1497| [45] ["Even if we could get past the gate, we'd have to face all of that...!"]
 95: 1523| [47] [Kazami]
 96: 1526| [45] ["... If the gate's made of lead, then it should be able to completely block off radiation..."]
 97: 1534| [47] [Kazami]
 98: 1537| [45] ["So perhaps the inner walls and ceiling are damaged."]
 99: 1542| [45] [No matter how strong the gate was, there was always the possibility that there were cracks in other spots.]
100: 1547| [45] [Though they were invisible to the naked eye, there was atomic dust and radiation leaking through them--]
101: 1555| [47] [Watase]
102: 1558| [45] ["... I see, so that's why the reading keeps on going up."]
103: 1584| [47] [Kazami]
104: 1587| [45] ["At any rate, this confirms that there's a melted down reactor on the other side of this gate."]
105: 1592| [45] [An area of death, swirling with hellfire and radiation.]
106: 1597| [45] [If the area around the gate was that bad even when shut, then they could only imagine just how much radiation would engulf them if they opened it up.]
107: 1602| [47] [Watase]
108: 1603| [45] [(It really would be suicide to go into that place...)]
109: 1608| [45] [Kazami continued as Watase held his breath in horror.]
110: 1616| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1619| [45] ["Be that as it may, we've now concluded our search of the inner ring, Captain. Let's assist with the search of the outer ring."]
112: 1627| [47] [Watase]
113: 1630| [45] ["... Yeah."]
114: 1635| [45] [The group nodded and ran off towards the outer ring.]
