  1:  131| [45] [--When did his watch break? What was the meaning behind Yuuri's cryptic message?--]
  2:  136| [45] [Natsuhiko thought for a moment in bewilderment, but eventually just shrugged.]
  3:  144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  147| [45] ["... You're such a worrywart, Yuuri."]
  5:  179| [47] [Yuuri]
  6:  182| [45] ["Huh?"]
  7:  190| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  193| [45] ["It's okay. Nothing scary's gonna happen, okay?"]
  9:  201| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  204| [45] ["I'm not the same guy I was in the past. I don't plunge headfirst into danger."]
 11:  227| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  228| [45] ["..."]
 13:  254| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  257| [45] ["... You're right."]
 15:  283| [47] [Yuuri]
 16:  286| [45] ["I'm sorry. I just kinda get anxious when I see gloomy stories on the news like that."]
 17:  294| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  297| [45] ["Now, now, it's nothing to worry about."]
 19:  513| [45] [As he spoke, he glanced at his watch-- and was taken aback.]
 20:  518| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  519| [45] [(What...?)]
 22:  524| [45] [He could've sworn he saw that his watch was broken just a second ago.]
 23:  529| [45] [But on closer inspection, the dial was unscratched, and the hands were ticking away as always.]
 24:  534| [45] [9/10, 6:49-- there was nothing strange about the time displayed, either.]
 25:  619| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  620| [45] [(... Guess I was seeing things.)]
 27:  625| [45] [It seemed a bit strange, but he had no other explanation.]
 28:  815| [45] [When Natsuhiko and Yuuri exchanged smiles, a slightly exasperated Mashiro chimed in.]
 29:  823| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  826| [45] ["What are you two muttering so seriously about?"]
 31:  852| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  855| [45] ["It's so early in the morning, so let's keep the conversation bright and cheerful."]
 33:  860| [45] [When he heard Mashiro's suggestion--]
 34:  891| [45] [--Natsuhiko obliged.]
 35:  899| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  902| [45] ["You're right. What's something fun we can talk about?"]
 37:  928| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  931| [45] ["Let's see... How about we talk about this season's morning anime?"]
 39:  957| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  960| [45] ["It's just about time for one of my top recommendations to air, too. So let's all watch it together~"]
 41:  968| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  971| [45] ["Oh, anime talk again..."]
 43:  997| [47] [Yuuri]
 44: 1000| [45] ["Mashiron sure loves anime."]
 45: 1026| [47] [Mashiro]
 46: 1029| [45] ["What's with that cold response, guys!?"]
 47: 1055| [47] [Mashiro]
 48: 1058| [45] ["I just want to eat delicious food while watching morning anime with my best buddies! There's no greater happiness than that!"]
 49: 1066| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50: 1069| [45] ["Sounds more like the breakfast of losers to me."]
 51: 1095| [47] [Yuuri]
 52: 1098| [45] ["It does sound like a good time, though~"]
 53: 1103| [45] [Yuuri spoke with a smile. Her earlier worries had seemingly subsided.]
 54: 1111| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 55: 1114| [45] ["Okay, then, Mashiro. So what's this recommendation of yours?"]
 56: 1140| [47] [Mashiro]
 57: 1143| [45] ["This, this."]
 58: 1217| [45] [As soon as Mashiro changed the channel, the opening theme to a children's anime began playing.]
 59: 1222| [45] [They all began watching as they enjoyed their breakfast...]
 60: 1249| [45] [--Natsuhiko declined.]
 61: 1257| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1260| [45] ["Now, now, what's wrong with a solemn morning every now and then?"]
 63: 1286| [47] [Mashiro]
 64: 1289| [45] ["Aww, but that's kind of depressing..."]
 65: 1294| [45] [Mashiro seemed a little dissatisfied, but--]
 66: 1317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67: 1318| [45] [(Well, Yuuri's a little depressed too, so what can I say?)]
 68: 1323| [45] [--with that thought in mind, he let her be.]
 69: 1328| [45] [And thus, their breakfast quietly came to an end...]
 70: 1442| [45] [--After breakfast, Natsuhiko quickly got dressed.]
 71: 1447| [45] [He grabbed his bag, turned on the lights, and bade farewell to Yuuri as she was staying at home.]
 72: 1543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1546| [45] ["Bye, Yuuri. We're off to school."]
 74: 1572| [47] [Mashiro]
 75: 1575| [45] ["Watch over the house for us, okay, Yuuri--"]
 76: 1601| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1604| [45] ["Have a nice day~"]
 78: 1654| [45] [And with that farewell, Natsuhiko and Mashiro left the house.]
 79: 1791| [45] [As they got outside, a cool breeze brushed against their cheeks.]
 80: 1887| [47] [Mashiro]
 81: 1890| [45] ["Ah, man, looks like the weather's getting perfect for walking, huh~"]
 82: 1898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1901| [45] ["Yeah, feels like fall will soon be upon us."]
 84: 1906| [45] [A day like this would be perfect for a leisurely stroll to school through the breeze, but--]
 85: 1911| [45] [A quick glance at his watch told Natsuhiko they only had around five minutes to make it to the bus stop in time.]
 86: 1919| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1922| [45] ["... Crap. We're really gonna be late at this rate, you know?"]
 88: 1948| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1951| [45] ["No way! L-let's run for it, Natsuhiko!"]
 90: 1959| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1962| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 92: 1987| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro broke off into a mad dash.]
 93: 2099| [45] [To the bus stop closest to Natsuhiko's home.]
 94: 2150| [45] [Along the way, they spotted the bus already at the stop.]
 95: 2158| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96: 2161| [45] ["Mashiro, hurry! Or the bus'll leave us behind!"]
 97: 2174| [45] [But just after Natsuhiko said that--]
 98: 2259| [45] [The bus had already begun to depart.]
 99: 2264| [45] [They needed to get on that bus or they'd be late for sure.]
100: 2272| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 2275| [45] ["H-hey! Hold on a second, driver, sir!"]
102: 2280| [45] [Natsuhiko's yelling fell on deaf ears as the bus began to speed away.]
103: 2288| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 2291| [45] ["Well, I guess it's not like he could hear me."]
105: 2306| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 2309| [45] ["Mashiro, what do--"]
107: 2314| [45] [Natsuhiko turned to Mashiro and immediately held his tongue.]
108: 2367| [47] [Mashiro]
109: 2368| [45] ["..."]
110: 2373| [45] [He had thought she was running along behind him, but she was instead standing still with her eyes closed--]
111: 2378| [45] [And her index finger to her temple.]
112: 2386| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 2389| [45] ["H-hey, Mashiro... you're not!?"]
114: 2397| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 2400| [45] ["One second, I'm concentrating..."]
116: 2405| [45] [Mashiro said thus, and the very next moment--]
117: 2500| [85] [{Stop!!}]
118: 2533| [86] [Mashiro]
119: 2534| [86] [{Stop!!}]
120: 2569| [45] [A voice rang out in all directions that seemed loud enough to reverberate the very core of one's mind.]
121: 2626| [45] [The birds in the trees flew away all at once.]
122: 2637| [45] [A dog basking in the sunny sidewalk leapt to its feet and scurried away in surprise.]
123: 2648| [45] [And finally, the bus that had left the two far behind suddenly braked.]
124: 2710| [47] [Mashiro]
125: 2713| [45] ["... Whew. Looks like he heard, huh?"]
126: 2721| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 2724| [45] ["S-sure did..."]
128: 2729| [45] [Natsuhiko held down his ears as he spoke.]
129: 2734| [45] [He felt like his eardrums were still shaking from that loud voice earlier, but--]
130: 2739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 2740| [45] [(Oh wait, it's got nothing to do with my ears...)]
132: 2745| [45] [--that voice was reverberating -directly in Natsuhiko's brain-.]
133: 2753| [47] [Natsuhiko]
134: 2756| [45] ["Mashiro, you used 'BC', didn't you...?"]
135: 2761| [45] [BC is the ability to communicate ideas directly to someone else's brain.]
136: 2766| [45] [A power one must never use recklessly--]
137: 2771| [45] [--And yet in light of an accusation of said reckless use, Mashiro nonchalantly replied.]
138: 2797| [47] [Mashiro]
139: 2800| [45] ["Heheheh. Well, if our voices couldn't reach him, why not directly appeal to his heart, if you catch my drift?"]
140: 2808| [47] [Natsuhiko]
141: 2811| [45] ["No, I do catch your drift there... but I mean, you can't go making mass untargeted transmissions like that."]
142: 2837| [47] [Mashiro]
143: 2840| [45] ["It's not like I had a choice. Our attendance record was on the line there."]
144: 2848| [47] [Natsuhiko]
145: 2851| [45] ["Oh boy... Don't come crying to me if you get arrested for violating regulations."]
146: 2877| [47] [Mashiro]
147: 2880| [45] ["Don't worry about it. They won't bother punishing a violation -that- minor."]
148: 2920| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro rushed to the stopped bus as they had that exchange.]
149: 2976| [45] [--And 20 long minutes after they narrowly managed to board the bus--]
150: 3069| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro arrived at their school, Rokumei Academy.]
151: 3074| [45] [A large-scale school incorporating elementary school all the way to high school.]
152: 3079| [45] [As they passed through the gate, Mashiro asked Natsuhiko a question.]
153: 3175| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 3178| [45] ["What do we have first period?"]
155: 3186| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 3189| [45] ["Parapsychology."]
157: 3215| [47] [Mashiro]
158: 3218| [45] ["Ugh, we have to move classrooms first thing in the morning?"]
159: 3226| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 3229| [45] ["What's wrong with that? I thought you loved BC lessons?"]
161: 3234| [45] [And with that exchange, Natsuhiko and Mashiro entered the school building.]
