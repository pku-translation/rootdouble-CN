  1:   58| [45] [--]
  2:   63| [45] [----]
  3:   68| [45] [------His consciousness was in an endless darkness.]
  4:   73| [45] [A world where everything was closed off.]
  5:   78| [45] [Sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste... he'd been disconnected from all his senses.]
  6:   83| [45] [It didn't feel like there was a world around for him to experience at all.]
  7:   88| [47] [???]
  8:   89| [45] [(Where am I...?)]
  9:   94| [45] [He didn't know.]
 10:   99| [45] [His head was a total blank.]
 11:  104| [47] [???]
 12:  105| [45] [(What is this...?)]
 13:  110| [45] [All he could sense was a feeling of loss.]
 14:  115| [47] [???]
 15:  116| [45] [(What's... going on...?)]
 16:  121| [45] [It felt like he was lacking anything definitive.]
 17:  126| [47] [???]
 18:  127| [45] [(How did this happen?)]
 19:  132| [45] [He desperately tried to figure out why.]
 20:  137| [45] [Soon enough, fragmented images twinkled in the corners of his mind.]
 21:  220| [47] [???]
 22:  221| [45] [(...!)]
 23:  226| [47] [???]
 24:  227| [45] [(I see...)]
 25:  232| [47] [???]
 26:  233| [45] [(So that thing attacked me--)]
 27:  316| [45] [Is this death!?]
 28:  399| [45] [No...!]
 29:  482| [45] [The sound of a beating heart-- echoed inside him.]
 30:  487| [45] [He knew for sure he could perceive that.]
 31:  499| [45] [This guy is--]
 32:  504| [45] [No, not "this guy"...!]
 33:  509| [47] [???]
 34:  510| [45] [(I'm...!)]
 35:  570| [45] [... alive...!]
 36:  575| [45] [Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch-- pain--]
 37:  580| [45] [I have all of those senses...!]
 38:  585| [45] [My body and consciousness are right here...]
 39:  590| [47] [???]
 40:  591| [45] [(I'm right here...!!)]
 41:  597| [45] [........]
 42:  602| [45] [--------]
 43:  713| [47] [Woman 1]
 44:  716| [45] ["--tain!"]
 45:  724| [47] [Woman 1]
 46:  727| [45] ["... Captain, please hang in there! Captain!"]
 47:  735| [47] [Woman 2]
 48:  738| [45] ["Get up, Captain! C'mon!"]
 49:  743| [45] [With the sound of those voices suddenly filling his ears--]
 50:  748| [45] [The man opened his eyes.]
 51:  948| [47] [Woman 1]
 52:  951| [45] ["Ah...! You've finally come to, haven't you!?"]
 53:  998| [47] [Woman 2]
 54: 1001| [45] ["W-what a relief! I thought you bit it there for a sec!"]
 55: 1009| [47] [Man]
 56: 1012| [45] ["...?"]
 57: 1017| [45] [The man said nothing as the women before him started addressing him.]
 58: 1064| [47] [Woman 2]
 59: 1067| [45] ["But what the heck are you doing here, Captain!? Shouldn't you be at the command post!?"]
 60: 1075| [47] [Woman 1]
 61: 1078| [45] ["More importantly, can you say your own name, or what day and month it is today?"]
 62: 1086| [47] [Man]
 63: 1089| [45] ["... What... huh?"]
 64: 1094| [45] [The man already felt confused in the face of the sudden storm of questions he'd been sucked into.]
 65: 1099| [45] [He first tried to grasp the situation around him.]
 66: 1104| [45] [The women in front of him were wearing orange uniforms.]
 67: 1109| [47] [Man]
 68: 1110| [45] [(So they're firefighters... no, rescue workers?)]
 69: 1115| [45] [Their uniforms were covered in soot.]
 70: 1120| [45] [Disaster, accident, rescue-- vague images related to those words swirled around the man's mind.]
 71: 1128| [47] [Man]
 72: 1131| [45] ["Who a-- no, where am I...?"]
 73: 1178| [47] [Woman 1]
 74: 1181| [45] ["Ah, you shouldn't sit up yet!"]
 75: 1234| [45] [The man ignored her warnings and sat up, then checked his surroundings.]
 76: 1239| [45] [He was in some building he'd never seen before. He'd apparently been lying in the middle of a hall.]
 77: 1244| [45] [He could see cold steel doors and fire hydrants lining the corridor.]
 78: 1249| [45] [A glance up at the ceiling revealed air ducts, sprinklers, and so--]
 79: 1410| [47] [Man]
 80: 1413| [45] ["Ugh!"]
 81: 1418| [45] [A sharp headache hit the man at that moment, causing him to fall to the floor yet again.]
 82: 1426| [47] [Woman 2]
 83: 1429| [45] ["Are you okay!? Are you in pain!?"]
 84: 1437| [47] [Man]
 85: 1440| [45] ["N-no... I'm fine..."]
 86: 1485| [45] [Just then, the man realized he was wearing the same uniform as the women.]
 87: 1490| [47] [Man]
 88: 1491| [45] [(...? Why am I wearing this thing...?)]
 89: 1496| [45] [He felt a strange sense of discomfort.]
 90: 1501| [45] [Like he had no connection with himself. Why was he in this uniform?]
 91: 1509| [47] [Man]
 92: 1512| [45] ["What... am I...?"]
 93: 1517| [45] [The man stood up as he shook his groggy head.]
 94: 1565| [45] [His body also felt off.]
 95: 1570| [45] [Almost like his body and mind weren't properly linked.]
 96: 1575| [47] [Man]
 97: 1576| [45] [(It kinda feels like this isn't my body or something...)]
 98: 1581| [45] [No sooner had this thought crossed the man's mind--]
 99: 1604| [45] [ than did the air suddenly shake.]
100: 1618| [47] [Man]
101: 1621| [45] ["Wh-what was that!?"]
102: 1626| [45] [The women paid no heed to the man's confusion and instead exchanged glances.]
103: 1688| [47] [Woman 1]
104: 1691| [45] ["Another explosion...!?"]
105: 1718| [47] [Woman 2]
106: 1721| [45] ["Maybe a fire's broken out! Let's go, Lieutenant!"]
107: 1747| [47] [Lieutenant]
108: 1750| [45] ["Right! Captain, please rest here! We'll handle this one by ourselves!"]
109: 1814| [45] [The woman who'd been called "Lieutenant" broke off into a run alongside the other woman (who was apparently her subordinate).]
110: 1822| [47] [Man]
111: 1825| [45] ["... Huh? H-hold on!"]
112: 1830| [45] [Scared of being left alone and totally in the dark about what was going on, the man followed the two.]
113: 1909| [45] [He called out to them as he started closing the distance.]
114: 1917| [47] [Man]
115: 1920| [45] ["W-wait up, you guys!"]
116: 1997| [47] [Lieutenant]
117: 2000| [45] ["Captain!? I thought I asked you to rest!"]
118: 2026| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
119: 2029| [45] ["Nah, I think he looks okay! Give us a hand, all right!?"]
120: 2037| [47] [Man]
121: 2040| [45] ["N-no, that's not it! I just want to ask you something!"]
122: 2048| [47] [Man]
123: 2051| [45] ["What was that noise!? What's happening!?"]
124: 2077| [47] [Lieutenant]
125: 2080| [45] ["Huh!?"]
126: 2106| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
127: 2109| [45] ["Wh-what're you talking about, Captain!? You saying you don't get what's going on!?"]
128: 2117| [47] [Man]
129: 2120| [45] ["N-no, I don't..."]
130: 2125| [45] [The women looked at each other for a brief second.]
131: 2151| [47] [Lieutenant]
132: 2154| [45] ["--You'll understand if you come along! Please keep close to us!"]
133: 2218| [45] [The lieutenant broke off into another run at those words, with the man hot on her trail.]
134: 2270| [45] [She then opened a door at the end of the hall--]
135: 2359| [45] [Sending intense heat surging out of it.]
136: 2364| [47] [Man]
137: 2365| [45] [(What is this heat...!?)]
138: 2370| [45] [A heat haze filled the area, distorting their vision of what was before them.]
139: 2403| [47] [Lieutenant]
140: 2406| [45] ["Khh... we need to put out this fire on the double!"]
141: 2447| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
142: 2450| [45] ["Yeah, before there's another explosion!"]
143: 2465| [45] [The women passed through the open doorway.]
144: 2470| [45] [The man followed suit and ran through the hallway--]
145: 2562| [45] [only to be greeted with hellfire.]
146: 2677| [47] [All]
147: 2680| [45] ["!?"]
148: 2685| [45] [The man froze in shock at the scene he was confronted with.]
149: 2690| [45] [But the women quickly got to work without even a moment's hesitation.]
150: 2716| [47] [Lieutenant]
151: 2719| [45] ["Get a hose ready!"]
152: 2745| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
153: 2748| [45] ["Roger!"]
154: 2835| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
155: 2838| [45] ["Whoa-- outta the way, Captain!"]
156: 2903| [47] [Man]
157: 2906| [45] ["Whoa!?"]
158: 2911| [45] [The female rescue worker pushed the man aside and pulled out a hose from a fire hydrant built into the nearby wall.]
159: 2916| [45] [She then passed it to the lieutenant, who directed its nozzle toward the flames.]
160: 3029| [47] [Lieutenant]
161: 3032| [45] ["Commence water release!"]
162: 3040| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
163: 3043| [45] ["Roger! Here it comes!!"]
164: 3134| [45] [A jetstream of water collided with the flames, which erupted into large clouds of steam.]
165: 3139| [47] [Man]
166: 3140| [45] [(Incredible... the fire's getting smaller and smaller by the second...!)]
167: 3145| [45] [The man stared at the swiftly dying fire with stark amazement.]
168: 3150| [45] [Just then, he heard something else mixed in with the sound of the flames evaporating--%Na faint sound.]
169: 3204| [47] [???]
170: 3207| [45] ["... one..."]
171: 3212| [47] [Man]
172: 3213| [45] [(Was that a voice...?)]
173: 3218| [45] [He wondered if it was his mind playing tricks on him for a second.]
174: 3223| [45] [But as soon as he strained his ears--]
175: 3231| [47] [Girl]
176: 3234| [45] ["He... help me...!"]
177: 3338| [45] [He definitely heard what sounded like a young girl's voice coming from the room in front of him.]
178: 3363| [47] [Man]
179: 3366| [45] ["Someone's... in that room!?"]
180: 3423| [45] [The man's body started running as soon as this thought hit him, weaving its way through the gaps between the flames.]
181: 3428| [45] [The room's door was crushed inwards due to the effects of the explosion.]
182: 3433| [45] [The man peeked into the room from the shadow of the broken door--]
183: 3493| [45] [--and discovered a world of fire and smoke.]
184: 3524| [47] [Man]
185: 3525| [45] [(Where is it!? Where's that voice coming from...?)]
186: 3530| [45] [His hair was singed by the sparks bathing him, creating an awful stench that hung in the air. What's more, his eyes were tearing up thanks to the smoke irritating them.]
187: 3535| [45] [But he endured it and focused on searching the room--]
188: 3565| [47] [Girl]
189: 3568| [45] ["Someone... help... me..."]
190: 3573| [45] [--Found her!]
191: 3687| [45] [Through the fire and flames, he could see a girl crouching under a desk in the room.]
192: 3695| [47] [Man]
193: 3698| [45] ["Are you okay!?"]
194: 3703| [45] [The girl looked towards the man's voice with hope in her eyes.]
195: 3708| [45] [But the moment her gaze met the man's,]
196: 3757| [47] [Girl]
197: 3760| [45] ["--!?"]
198: 3765| [45] [her face froze.]
199: 3770| [47] [Man]
200: 3771| [45] [(Wha... what's with that look!?)]
201: 3776| [45] [Overcome with confusion, he came to a halt.]
202: 3781| [45] [But at that moment--]
203: 3839| [85] [{Don't stop!}]
204: 3840| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
205: 3841| [86] [{Don't stop!}]
206: 3856| [85] [{Save her!}]
207: 3857| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
208: 3858| [86] [{Save her!}]
209: 3886| [45] [He suddenly heard a voice.]
210: 3894| [47] [Man]
211: 3897| [45] ["!?"]
212: 3902| [45] [He didn't know whose voice it was. It sounded like it'd echoed from inside him.]
213: 3907| [45] [But the moment he heard it, everything suddenly fell into place.]
214: 3912| [45] [He finally realized why he was here.]
215: 3917| [47] [Man]
216: 3918| [45] [(That's right--)]
217: 3923| [47] [Man]
218: 3924| [45] [(I came here to save her!)]
219: 3929| [45] [The moment he came to that realization, his previously divided body and nerves seemed to finally become one.]
220: 3934| [45] [The flames were closing in on the girl.]
221: 3939| [45] [The voice resounded yet again in his head.]
222: 3997| [85] [{--Go save her!!}]
223: 3998| [86] [Auditory Hallucination]
224: 3999| [86] [{--Go save her!!}]
225: 4027| [45] [And with that command giving him the final push he needed--]
226: 4032| [45] [the man lunged into the blazing flames.]
