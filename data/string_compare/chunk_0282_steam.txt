  0:   53| [45] [--The next thing Natsuhiko saw was far further into the future than what he saw last--]
  1:   58| [45] [A memory of the recent past.]
  2:  109| [45] [Natsuhiko naturally knew just how much time had passed.]
  3:  114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  115| [45] [(... Ahh.)]
  5:  120| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  121| [45] [(It's nine years after that day, huh...)]
  7:  126| [45] [Yes-- This was a memory of just around two months ago.]
  8:  155| [45] [That day, Yuuri was in her own room in LABO, having a talk with the professor.]
  9:  181| [47] [Miyoko]
 10:  184| [45] ["--July 7th has come again this year, huh."]
 11:  192| [47] [Yuuri]
 12:  195| [45] ["That was quick. Has it really been nine years already?"]
 13:  200| [45] [In all that time, Yuuri had grown, both physically and mentally.]
 14:  205| [45] [As a test subject, Yuuri had proven to be a major contribution to LABO's developed products-- especially in the fields of AD development and BC insulator improvement.]
 15:  210| [45] [She had not a single worry and spent her days in true peace.]
 16:  236| [47] [Miyoko]
 17:  239| [45] ["... Yuuri. How have these nine years been for you...?"]
 18:  247| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  250| [45] ["Huh? Well, they were fun."]
 20:  258| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  261| [45] ["You've bought me anything I've ever wanted and I get to live in such a nice room too..."]
 22:  329| [45] [--The only luxury she wasn't afforded was the freedom to go outside.]
 23:  334| [45] [But she had already stopped thinking about it.]
 24:  353| [47] [Yuuri]
 25:  356| [45] ["... And besides, you're really nice, Professor. All the little things make me happy."]
 26:  364| [47] [Yuuri]
 27:  367| [45] ["Um... You're like a real mom to me."]
 28:  394| [47] [Miyoko]
 29:  397| [45] ["... Yuuri."]
 30:  402| [45] [The professor wrapped her arms around Yuuri's shoulders.]
 31:  407| [45] [Just as Yuuri had said, the professor showered her with unrestrained love.]
 32:  412| [45] [The origin of that love was almost certainly due to the guilt she felt for Yuuri.]
 33:  417| [45] [But regardless, the two of them forged a relationship akin to a real mother and daughter.%NThey shared a deep understanding of each other.]
 34:  443| [47] [Miyoko]
 35:  446| [45] ["... But now that today has come, we really do need to start thinking."]
 36:  454| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  457| [45] ["... About Hikorin, right?"]
 38:  462| [45] [Indeed-- now that today had come, there was something they were keenly reminded of, whether they wanted to think of it or not:]
 39:  467| [45] [Ever since that night when Yuuri had manipulated his memories, Natsuhiko had started seeing a phantom of her.]
 40:  534| [45] [--Nine years ago, Yuuri fabricated a false memory for Natsuhiko that she was "alive and always with him".]
 41:  584| [45] [And as part of that fabrication, she chose not to restore some of his memories, such as the particulars of the incident and how his BC abilities had awakened.]
 42:  589| [45] [It was a very selfish use of memory manipulation-- one that left a scar on his mind.]
 43:  657| [47] [Miyoko]
 44:  660| [45] ["... A human's personality consists of an accumulation of memories. The spirit is the aggregation of information within the brain..."]
 45:  668| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  671| [45] ["The addition of fabricated memories created a decisive inconsistency with reality."]
 47:  697| [47] [Miyoko]
 48:  700| [45] ["So in order to reconcile that inconsistency, Natsuhiko's brain created a phantom Yuuri to restore mental balance..."]
 49:  705| [45] [With just minor tampering to his memory, Natsuhiko became so firmly adherent to those lies that even his perception of reality became warped.]
 50:  710| [45] [Over these past nine years, Yuuri had become painfully aware of the sheer magnitude of the effects memory manipulation had on the human mind.]
 51:  718| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  721| [45] ["... Tell me, Professor. Was I right to do what I did?"]
 53:  747| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  750| [45] ["I can't say whether it was right or wrong, but it was true that you had no other choice."]
 55:  776| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  779| [45] ["It was probably too hard for you to completely erase all of his memories of you with perfect accuracy to begin with."]
 57:  787| [47] [Yuuri]
 58:  790| [45] ["Huh?"]
 59:  816| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  819| [45] ["We didn't really know it yet back then, but as our research progressed, we established that there are several issues with memory erasure, haven't we?"]
 61:  827| [47] [Miyoko]
 62:  830| [45] ["Such as how 'in almost all cases, erased memories are eventually restored'."]
 63:  838| [47] [Yuuri]
 64:  841| [45] ["Good point..."]
 65:  846| [45] [Memories are lumps of powerful information energy.]
 66:  851| [45] [And memory erasure is an ability that destroys that lump of energy by striking it with even stronger energy.]
 67:  856| [45] [Which in turn causes the memory to disperse into fragments that are impossible to remember.]
 68:  861| [45] [However, the fragments of the memory and the memory in its entirety do not completely disappear.]
 69:  866| [45] [With the passage of enough time and given some sort of impetus, the brain can restructure the fragmentary information and restore the memory.]
 70:  871| [45] [The target's reaction is also significant.]
 71:  876| [45] [After all, sudden "amnesia" would astonish just about anybody to the point where they'd be driven to try and recall the vanished memory by whatever means necessary.]
 72:  902| [47] [Miyoko]
 73:  905| [45] ["... And besides, after you and Natsuhiko met, you were always together."]
 74:  913| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  916| [45] ["Even if you forcibly erased all of his memories, there's no doubt that somebody would eventually bring you up as a matter of discussion."]
 76:  942| [47] [Miyoko]
 77:  945| [45] ["And once that happened, Natsuhiko would notice the contradiction between his memories and reality and would reach another deadlock with the truth."]
 78:  953| [47] [Miyoko]
 79:  956| [45] ["There was no other way to break that cycle than to do what you did..."]
 80:  961| [45] [Just as the professor said-- it was found to be far easier to cope with memory manipulation than with memory erasure.]
 81:  966| [45] [When a certain memory is replaced with a different memory, the brain obediently accepts the change.]
 82:  971| [45] [The reason for that is that rather than undergoing 'amnesia', the target may experience various other phenomena such as believing they simply remembered wrong.]
 83:  976| [45] [But Yuuri was well aware of what she had done.]
 84:  981| [47] [Yuuri]
 85:  982| [45] [(I'm sorry, Professor... but that's not all there was to it.)]
 86:  987| [45] [When she was a child, Yuuri just couldn't bear having Natsuhiko forget about her.]
 87:  992| [45] [But as a result, she had to keep cleaning up the mess she had made.]
 88:  997| [45] [As Yuuri reflected upon her actions, the professor suddenly looked at her watch.]
 89: 1023| [47] [Miyoko]
 90: 1026| [45] ["... Oh my. It's almost time for that boy to arrive."]
 91: 1034| [47] [Yuuri]
 92: 1037| [45] ["Ah, right."]
 93: 1063| [47] [Miyoko]
 94: 1066| [45] ["Let's go, Yuuri. It's time for your yearly date."]
 95: 1080| [45] [Yuuri nodded and left the room with the professor.]
 96: 1129| [45] [--They headed for the Area 5 neuroscience laboratory.]
 97: 1139| [45] [There, Yuuri reunited with Natsuhiko.]
 98: 1200| [47] [Yuuri]
 99: 1203| [45] ["It's been a whole year, hasn't it, Hikorin?"]
100: 1208| [45] [In front of them was Natsuhiko, put to sleep with drugs.]
101: 1213| [45] [LABO staff had brought him all the way here.]
102: 1221| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1224| [45] ["Yuuri, you'd rather be alone with him, wouldn't you? I'll be waiting outside."]
104: 1232| [47] [Yuuri]
105: 1235| [45] ["Ah... y-yes. Thank you."]
106: 1246| [45] [The professor smiled boldly as she left the room.]
107: 1294| [45] [--Back on the night where Yuuri agreed to her incarceration in LABO--]
108: 1299| [45] [She had asked the professor for one favor.]
109: 1367| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1370| [45] ["Please let me see him... Even just once in a while... Even just once a year. Please."]
111: 1378| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1381| [45] ["That's all I ask."]
113: 1407| [47] [Miyoko]
114: 1410| [45] ["... I promise."]
115: 1459| [45] [--The professor kept that promise.]
116: 1464| [45] [Once each year on July 7, the anniversary of the accident, Yuuri was allowed to see him in this fashion.]
117: 1469| [45] [Granted, Natsuhiko himself was not aware of these little dates.]
118: 1474| [45] [He was under the impression that he stayed at Rokumei City Hospital once a year for a yearly checkup.]
119: 1479| [45] [And once he was there, he'd be administered with a sleeping medication and taken to LABO-- and back again-- before he woke up.]
120: 1579| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1580| [45] [(This is the only way we can meet... but it's plenty.)]
122: 1585| [45] [However, the purpose of these reunions wasn't only so she could see his face.]
123: 1590| [45] [He was brought here once a year to renew the "memory of the Yuuri" that was inside him.]
124: 1595| [45] [The phantom Yuuri created by his brain was, after all, a phantom and nothing more.]
125: 1600| [45] [If no action were taken, the phantom Yuuri would gradually become disparate from the real Yuuri.]
126: 1605| [45] [This was, in essence, maintenance to adjust for changes and disparities-- Such was the truth of Natsuhiko's "yearly checkups".]
127: 1610| [47] [Yuuri]
128: 1611| [45] [(... I'm not quite sure if this is really for Hikorin's sake...)]
129: 1616| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1617| [45] [(But to be honest, I'm glad I get to see him.)]
131: 1622| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1623| [45] [(Forgive me, Hikorin...)]
133: 1630| [45] [Yuuri gently bowed her head and stepped up to Natsuhiko.]
134: 1638| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1641| [45] ["How was your year...?"]
136: 1705| [45] [And thus, Yuuri dove into Natsuhiko's memory.]
137: 1862| [45] [--A year's worth of memories floated in Natsuhiko's mind.]
138: 1867| [45] [They were sights of an uneventful daily life.]
139: 1930| [47] [Mashiro]
140: 1933| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Food's ready~!"]
141: 1941| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142: 1944| [45] ["Ah, sorry for always making you do this."]
143: 1970| [47] [Mashiro]
144: 1973| [45] ["It's fine, it's fine. I'm doing it because I want to see your smiling face~!"]
145: 1978| [45] [It was a scene of a morning before school.]
146: 1986| [47] [Yuuri]
147: 1987| [45] [(Ah, it's Mashiron!)]
148: 1992| [45] [Yuuri loved Mashiro too.]
149: 1997| [45] [Though it was only in a memory, Yuuri was honestly glad to see Mashiro again.]
150: 2008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 2011| [45] ["There you go joking again. It's not for me, but for Yuuri, right?"]
152: 2037| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 2040| [45] ["Ah, saw through my ruse?"]
154: 2045| [45] [Apparently Mashiro began cooking meals at Natsuhiko's house this spring.]
155: 2050| [45] [So these newest memories included a lot of memories with Mashiro.]
156: 2206| [47] [Mashiro]
157: 2209| [45] ["C'mon, c'mon, Natsuhiko. We're gonna be late."]
158: 2217| [47] [Natsuhiko]
159: 2220| [45] ["S-sorry. I ate too much during breakfast..."]
160: 2225| [45] [Each individual memory was trivial by itself.]
161: 2367| [47] [Mashiro]
162: 2370| [45] ["Natsuhiko, come shopping with me. There's just a few things I want to buy."]
163: 2378| [47] [Natsuhiko]
164: 2381| [45] ["What. More anime shop visits?"]
165: 2407| [47] [Mashiro]
166: 2410| [45] ["Why not? Not like you're busy, right?"]
167: 2415| [45] [But something bothered Yuuri about Mashiro's facial expressions in these memories.]
168: 2557| [47] [Mashiro]
169: 2560| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Natsuhiko look at this! Cute, right?"]
170: 2568| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2571| [45] ["So what you wanted to buy was clothes? Look, I don't really get girl clothes."]
172: 2597| [47] [Mashiro]
173: 2600| [45] ["I just want a boy's opinion. Wanna get a less biased view, that's all."]
174: 2605| [45] [The way Mashiro looked at, spoke to, and behaved with Natsuhiko--]
175: 2610| [45] [--made it quite obvious that she was falling in love with him.]
176: 2640| [47] [Yuuri]
177: 2641| [45] [(Mashiron...)]
178: 2646| [47] [Yuuri]
179: 2647| [45] [(She likes Hikorin...?)]
180: 2800| [45] [--As Yuuri returned to reality, she gazed at Natsuhiko's sleeping face and whispered.]
181: 2850| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 2853| [45] ["... That's right."]
183: 2861| [47] [Yuuri]
184: 2864| [45] ["I can't keep Hikorin to myself forever..."]
185: 2869| [45] [It would be way too cruel to do that to Mashiro.]
186: 2923| [47] [Yuuri]
187: 2924| [45] [(Mashiron's a way better girl than I am, after all...)]
188: 2929| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2930| [45] [(Hikorin's better off with her...)]
190: 2945| [45] [At any rate, Yuuri would never be able to properly see Natsuhiko in person for the rest of her life.]
191: 2950| [45] [It was already unnatural for her to be seeing him this way as it was.]
192: 2955| [45] [In that case, both Natsuhiko and Mashiro would be better off if they forgot about Yuuri.]
193: 2960| [45] [That thought began to rapidly spread within Yuuri's mind.]
194: 3015| [45] [She walked out of the laboratory with slumped shoulders to find the professor waiting in the hall.]
195: 3048| [47] [Miyoko]
196: 3051| [45] ["Yuuri, how was your yearly date?"]
197: 3059| [47] [Yuuri]
198: 3062| [45] ["Professor..."]
199: 3070| [47] [Yuuri]
200: 3073| [45] ["Do you think it would be better... if I replaced all of Hikorin's memories of me... with memories of Mashiron...?"]
201: 3099| [47] [Miyoko]
202: 3102| [45] ["... Huh? What makes you say that again?"]
203: 3110| [47] [Yuuri]
204: 3113| [45] ["It's just, if I don't, then Mashiron will never..."]
205: 3139| [47] [Miyoko]
206: 3142| [45] ["... Are you worrying yourself over Mashiro?"]
207: 3147| [45] [Yuuri nodded weakly.]
208: 3152| [45] [But after a moment of contemplation, the professor shook her head and replied.]
209: 3178| [47] [Miyoko]
210: 3181| [45] ["It would probably be bad to do that..."]
211: 3189| [47] [Yuuri]
212: 3192| [45] ["Why's that?"]
213: 3218| [47] [Miyoko]
214: 3221| [45] ["I believe that manipulating Natsuhiko's memories about you would cause serious problems in his mind."]
215: 3229| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 3232| [45] ["Oh no... But if I do it carefully, then..."]
217: 3258| [47] [Miyoko]
218: 3261| [45] ["No. Your existence is too important to Natsuhiko to just erase it."]
219: 3287| [47] [Miyoko]
220: 3290| [45] ["And even if that weren't the case, Natsuhiko's mind is already affected by innumerable problems."]
221: 3298| [47] [Yuuri]
222: 3301| [45] ["Huh?"]
223: 3309| [47] [Miyoko]
224: 3312| [45] ["So far, Natsuhiko has nearly noticed your absence several times, but he has yet to recognize it."]
225: 3320| [47] [Miyoko]
226: 3323| [45] ["That cognitive dissonance has resulted in bizarre behavior from him as well."]
227: 3331| [47] [Yuuri]
228: 3334| [45] ["Bizarre behavior...?"]
229: 3360| [47] [Miyoko]
230: 3363| [45] ["For example, Natsuhiko has prepared hot milk for you in our living room before, correct?"]
231: 3371| [47] [Yuuri]
232: 3374| [45] ["Y-yes."]
233: 3382| [47] [Miyoko]
234: 3385| [45] ["But since you don't actually exist there, the milk in your cup never decreases in volume, see."]
235: 3411| [47] [Miyoko]
236: 3414| [45] ["But Natsuhiko never questioned that fact."]
237: 3422| [47] [Miyoko]
238: 3425| [45] ["He empties the completely full cup of cold milk in the sink without a word."]
239: 3451| [47] [Miyoko]
240: 3454| [45] ["If you try and tell him that the cup's full, he just says 'Huh, what?' and makes a genuinely confused face."]
241: 3462| [47] [Yuuri]
242: 3465| [45] ["Is... is that a thing?"]
243: 3474| [47] [Miyoko]
244: 3477| [45] ["It is. It's called 'denial syndrome', incidentally..."]
245: 3503| [47] [Miyoko]
246: 3506| [45] ["He's had several other instances of bizarre behavior."]
247: 3514| [47] [Miyoko]
248: 3517| [45] ["For example, every day before he leaves for school, he turns the living room lights on."]
249: 3525| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 3528| [45] ["The lights? Why?"]
251: 3554| [47] [Miyoko]
252: 3557| [45] ["Because if he didn't, there would be no lights on at home by the time he got back."]
253: 3565| [47] [Miyoko]
254: 3568| [45] ["It wouldn't make sense if there were no lights on in the house even though you were supposed to be there."]
255: 3576| [47] [Miyoko]
256: 3579| [45] ["So to avoid that inconsistency, Natsuhiko turns the lights on before he leaves the house...%NAnd he does it all unconsciously."]
257: 3584| [45] [Once she had heard all that, Yuuri murmured in a quivering voice.]
258: 3592| [47] [Yuuri]
259: 3595| [45] ["Then all because of me, Hikorin's...!"]
260: 3621| [47] [Miyoko]
261: 3624| [45] ["No, it's not your fault."]
262: 3632| [47] [Miyoko]
263: 3635| [45] ["Denial syndrome often occurs when the brain encounters any sort of functional abnormality."]
264: 3661| [47] [Miyoko]
265: 3664| [45] ["Such cases have been reported worldwide... All of the bizarre behaviors Natsuhiko has demonstrated have been seen in other patients."]
266: 3690| [47] [Miyoko]
267: 3693| [45] ["So please... don't you ever say it's your fault again."]
268: 3698| [45] [That didn't stop the tears from flowing.]
269: 3703| [45] [The gravity of her actions nine years ago threatened to crush Yuuri.]
270: 3711| [47] [Yuuri]
271: 3714| [45] ["Professor... what do I do...?"]
272: 3740| [47] [Miyoko]
273: 3743| [45] ["Let's see... If Natsuhiko were to become strong enough to handle the truth one day..."]
274: 3751| [47] [Miyoko]
275: 3754| [45] ["Maybe it would be okay to tell it to him then."]
276: 3762| [47] [Yuuri]
277: 3765| [45] ["But how will we know when that time has come...?"]
278: 3791| [47] [Miyoko]
279: 3794| [45] ["We won't. So one day--"]
280: 3820| [47] [Miyoko]
281: 3823| [45] ["One day, I'll free you from LABO. I swear."]
282: 3846| [47] [Yuuri]
283: 3849| [45] ["!?"]
284: 3854| [45] [Yuuri doubted her ears.]
285: 3859| [45] [She couldn't believe the leading researcher in the field of BC would say such a thing.]
286: 3867| [47] [Miyoko]
287: 3870| [45] ["LABO will no longer have a reason to restrain you once we've solved all the mysteries surrounding BC."]
288: 3878| [47] [Miyoko]
289: 3881| [45] ["I intend to devote my life to make sure that happens."]
290: 3907| [47] [Miyoko]
291: 3910| [45] ["I doubt it will redeem me for my sin of destroying your life, though..."]
292: 3918| [47] [Yuuri]
293: 3921| [45] ["But you didn't..."]
294: 3929| [47] [Miyoko]
295: 3932| [45] ["And even if I can't fulfill that promise..."]
296: 3958| [47] [Miyoko]
297: 3961| [45] ["I will gladly do whatever I can to get you all out of here. Even if it costs me my life."]
298: 3969| [47] [Yuuri]
299: 3972| [45] ["Huh?"]
300: 3998| [47] [Miyoko]
301: 4001| [45] ["Truth be told, I've been secretly advancing preparations for such a plan."]
302: 4027| [47] [Miyoko]
303: 4030| [45] ["It's not something I can do alone, so it'll be a difficult journey... but one day, for sure..."]
304: 4063| [45] [The professor spoke remorsefully as she brought Yuuri into a gentle embrace.]
305: 4068| [45] [--Yuuri understood.]
306: 4073| [45] [That it was another wish that could not be granted.]
307: 4078| [45] [For the two of them had been together for nine years. Yuuri could tell the professor felt hopeless, even without using BC.]
308: 4083| [47] [Yuuri]
309: 4084| [45] [(BC research is endless...)]
310: 4089| [47] [Yuuri]
311: 4090| [45] [(And I'm sure there are other reasons why they keep me incarcerated.)]
312: 4095| [47] [Yuuri]
313: 4096| [45] [(Not that I can imagine what those reasons are...)]
314: 4101| [45] [But regardless, she questioned whether or not she had to stay there forever.]
315: 4106| [45] [She questioned how to free Natsuhiko and Mashiro from the curse she cast over them.]
316: 4111| [45] [But without her finding a single answer to any of these questions--]
317: 4116| [45] [The days passed by.]
