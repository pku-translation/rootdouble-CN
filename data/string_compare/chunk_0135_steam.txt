  1:   84| [45] [--And after the end of an eventful lunch period, afternoon classes began.]
  2:   89| [45] [Afternoon curriculum included "Modern Language" and "Politics and Economics".]
  3:  132| [45] [Natsuhiko was unskilled with BC, but he took pride in the other subjects.]
  4:  175| [45] [There was a quick refresher quiz since summer break ended, but he finished it easily--]
  5:  192| [45] [And with that, today's classes came to a close.]
  6:  278| [47] [Ena]
  7:  281| [45] ["Okay, congratulations on completing yet another day of class, everyone."]
  8:  286| [45] [Ena greeted the class in the afternoon as their substitute homeroom teacher.]
  9:  291| [45] [Their original homeroom teacher was on maternity leave, so Ena was filling in.]
 10:  317| [47] [Ena]
 11:  320| [45] ["There are no announcements in particular today. So, see you all tomorrow~"]
 12:  389| [45] [And as soon as Ena left, the classroom broke into noise.]
 13:  394| [45] [The students still hadn't settled in since summer break, and so naturally, they wanted to go enjoy themselves after school.]
 14:  463| [45] [Natsuhiko was an indoorsman, and so essentially, he intended to go straight home after school--]
 15:  468| [45] [--but Mashiro stopped him before he could.]
 16:  494| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  497| [45] ["Natsuhiko~ hold on a second."]
 18:  549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 19:  552| [45] ["Hmm... what's up, Mashiro?"]
 20:  560| [47] [Mashiro]
 21:  563| [45] ["We ran out of groceries. I'll go buy some more, so come along with me."]
 22:  571| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  574| [45] ["Huh, already? Well okay, let's go then."]
 24:  600| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  603| [45] ["Eheheh, thanks a bunch~"]
 26:  608| [45] [He could hardly refuse her request. Those groceries were going into his and Yuuri's stomachs, after all.]
 27:  631| [45] [But upon hearing their conversation, some of their classmates jumped in.]
 28:  636| [47] [Male Student 1]
 29:  639| [45] ["Oh my, going for some evening shopping together, eh Tenkawa, Toba? You two sure get along."]
 30:  644| [47] [Female Student 1]
 31:  647| [45] ["You two are totally like newlyweds."]
 32:  652| [47] [Female Student 2]
 33:  655| [45] ["Eh, so Mashiro's a newlywed wife? That sounds kinda risque..."]
 34:  681| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  684| [45] ["Geez, guys. It's not like that."]
 36:  692| [47] [Mashiro]
 37:  695| [45] ["You see, Natsuhiko's mother is too busy to be at home. So I prepare the food for them. That's all."]
 38:  700| [47] [Female Student 1]
 39:  703| [45] ["Really? That's totally suspicious. Can you really do something like that every day just out of the goodness of your heart?"]
 40:  729| [47] [Mashiro]
 41:  732| [45] ["Of course. The great Mashiro Toba can't neglect a single person in need."]
 42:  737| [45] [Mashiro's declaration only incited shrill squealing from the girls.]
 43:  742| [45] [And it made Natsuhiko uncomfortable.]
 44:  829| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 45:  832| [45] ["That's enough. Let's go, Mashiro."]
 46:  872| [47] [Mashiro]
 47:  875| [45] ["Huh? Wah, wait a second, Natsuhiko?"]
 48:  880| [45] [Natsuhiko pulled Mashiro by the hand as if to escape from the classroom.]
 49: 1098| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50: 1101| [45] ["Look, Mashiro. We've been in this class for half a year now, you know?"]
 51: 1109| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52: 1112| [45] ["Everyone knows our circumstances. They're just teasing us, so there's no need for you to take everything they say seriously."]
 53: 1138| [47] [Mashiro]
 54: 1141| [45] ["Huh, really?"]
 55: 1146| [45] [Mashiro responded as if she had never considered the thought.]
 56: 1162| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1165| [45] ["Geez... you really are dense, you know."]
 58: 1170| [45] [Natsuhiko lightly karate chopped Mashiro on the head.]
 59: 1249| [47] [Mashiro]
 60: 1252| [45] ["Ow! That's mean, Natsuhiko. How could you say that!?"]
 61: 1260| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62: 1263| [45] ["Actually, I'm thankful for what you do, it's just... if weird rumors spread about us, it'd be a pain for you too, wouldn't it?"]
 63: 1286| [45] [It really seemed as if Mashiro knew nothing of the situation.]
 64: 1291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1292| [45] [(Aggh, she's really such a kid.)]
 66: 1297| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed silently.]
 67: 1305| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68: 1306| [45] [(Does she really not understand...?)]
 69: 1311| [45] [Despite his frustration with her, he had always been indebted to Mashiro, so it would be unwise of him to criticize her outright.]
 70: 1319| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71: 1322| [45] ["...Um, well, could you try not to talk too much about home in the classroom?"]
 72: 1348| [47] [Mashiro]
 73: 1351| [45] ["Really? I don't think it's that embarrassing that you can't cook. I mean, you're a guy, so it's only expected."]
 74: 1356| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed at how off the mark Mashiro was.]
 75: 1361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1362| [45] [(Why can't she just avoid their questions with some noncommittal answers...)]
 77: 1465| [45] [Natsuhiko was one to conduct himself well in the class.]
 78: 1470| [45] [He had a fair amount of friends and nobody in particular hated him. It was for that reason that they were able to tease him like that.]
 79: 1475| [45] [But to the very end, Natsuhiko was merely exerting conscious control over his interpersonal relations to live a fulfilling school life.]
 80: 1480| [45] [He tried not to make any needlessly deep relationships and he didn't want to reveal too much about his private life, either.]
 81: 1529| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1530| [45] [(That's just tiring.)]
 83: 1535| [45] [That was how Natsuhiko thought, but not Mashiro.]
 84: 1705| [45] [She would associate with anyone upfront. She hated lies, and lived with steadfast honesty--]
 85: 1710| [45] [Which was probably why she could not understand Natsuhiko's worldly wisdom.]
 86: 1715| [45] [And so, like always, Natsuhiko gave up.]
 87: 1770| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1773| [45] ["Well, whatever... Anyways, where are we going today?"]
 89: 1781| [47] [Mashiro]
 90: 1784| [45] ["The shopping area on Center Street. The supermarket's having a sale there."]
 91: 1792| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1795| [45] ["I see. Don't want to let that opportunity slip us by. Let's go before everything sells out."]
 93: 1821| [47] [Mashiro]
 94: 1824| [45] ["Yeah."]
 95: 1941| [45] [The two of them carried on their cliched household conversation as they left school...]
