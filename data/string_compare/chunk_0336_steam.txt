  0:   56| [45] [--Complaints aside, once Jun and the others rescued "Ena", the Rokumei Academy teacher--]
  1:  124| [45] [They headed to the surveillance room in Area 3, where they encountered "Ukita", a researcher.]
  2:  175| [45] [They then learned that "Natsuhiko", "Mashiro", and "Louise", the three high schoolers Jun had become acquainted with over the past week, were trapped in the facility...]
  3:  180| [45] [As a result, they focused their efforts on rescuing them.]
  4:  185| [45] [With limited AD, rising radiation levels, and no escape route in sight, the situation was extremely harsh.]
  5:  280| [45] [Teamwork was more essential than anything else at this point--]
  6:  285| [45] [Yet someone disrupted that teamwork.]
  7:  375| [47] [Ena]
  8:  378| [45] ["Oh come on, it's just smoke! I didn't take rescue workers for cowards!"]
  9:  383| [45] [And that someone was none other than Ena.]
 10:  388| [45] [Jun had called the search to a halt when she'd spotted smoke filling the outer ring, only to get another earful from Ena.]
 11:  719| [47] [Jun]
 12:  722| [45] ["Y'know, you've been really getting on my nerves for a while now...!"]
 13:  760| [47] [Jun]
 14:  763| [45] ["You're a civilian! What right do you have to get so high-and-mighty!?"]
 15:  816| [47] [Ena]
 16:  819| [45] ["I may be a civilian, but you're just a rookie, right? That's not much better."]
 17:  886| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 18:  938| [45] [Jun could tell she was trying to rush the search along because she was really worried about her students.]
 19:  943| [47] [Jun]
 20:  944| [45] [(But as a rescue worker, I just can't accept that!)]
 21:  949| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Yuuri came running over just as Jun thought that.]
 22:  982| [47] [Watase]
 23:  985| [45] ["Wh-what happened!?"]
 24: 1018| [47] [Kazami]
 25: 1021| [45] ["Moribe, what's all this commotion about!?"]
 26: 1029| [47] [Jun]
 27: 1032| [45] ["Ah, Lieutenant!"]
 28: 1040| [47] [Jun]
 29: 1043| [45] ["There's smoke in the outer ring up ahead. Looks like there's traces of a fire there."]
 30: 1051| [47] [Jun]
 31: 1054| [45] ["But we don't know where the fire's coming from since there's a ton of rooms, so I was telling Ms. Tsubakiyama and Mr. Ukita to wait somewhere safe, but--"]
 32: 1080| [47] [Ena]
 33: 1083| [45] ["Don't be an idiot! If there's traces of a fire, then that's all the more reason why we should -all- be searching!"]
 34: 1088| [45] [Ena started yelling again.]
 35: 1096| [47] [Kazami]
 36: 1099| [45] ["Do you want to die?"]
 37: 1160| [47] [Ena]
 38: 1163| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 39: 1189| [47] [Kazami]
 40: 1192| [45] ["If you don't want to die, then please stop complaining and listen to us."]
 41: 1197| [45] [But she was rendered silent by Kazami's blunt words.]
 42: 1223| [47] [Ena]
 43: 1226| [45] ["... I-I just wanted to help..."]
 44: 1252| [47] [Kazami]
 45: 1255| [45] ["And I truly am grateful for that. I apologize for being harsh on you."]
 46: 1263| [47] [Kazami]
 47: 1266| [45] ["But you can't take even the smallest of fires lightly. Please trust our judgment when it comes to disaster sites."]
 48: 1274| [47] [Kazami]
 49: 1277| [45] ["Our mission is to ensure that everyone gets out of here in one piece. So please--"]
 50: 1282| [45] [Not even Ena could resist caving in to Kazami's kind yet firm appeal.]
 51: 1308| [47] [Ena]
 52: 1311| [45] ["All right... then I'll leave it up to the professionals."]
 53: 1316| [45] [Jun was impressed.]
 54: 1323| [47] [Jun]
 55: 1324| [45] [(That's Sis for you... She managed to persuade Ms. Tsubakiyama so calmly in less than a minute. I should follow her example.)]
 56: 1329| [45] [She resolved to deal with these situations more like Kazami in the future.]
 57: 1415| [47] [Jun]
 58: 1418| [45] ["Y'know, you've been really getting on my nerves for a while now...!"]
 59: 1426| [47] [Jun]
 60: 1429| [45] ["You're a civilian! What right do you have to get so high-and-mighty!?"]
 61: 1455| [47] [Ena]
 62: 1458| [45] ["I may be a civilian, but you're just a rookie, right? That's not much better."]
 63: 1466| [47] [Jun]
 64: 1469| [45] ["Not much better? Don't give me that bullshit!"]
 65: 1477| [47] [Jun]
 66: 1480| [45] ["Do you know how hard I had to work just to join Sirius!?"]
 67: 1488| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1491| [45] ["A woman like you would never understand just how damn difficult it is to pass the rescue worker exam!"]
 69: 1517| [47] [Ena]
 70: 1520| [45] ["Of course I wouldn't. Or rather, I don't want to."]
 71: 1528| [47] [Ena]
 72: 1531| [45] ["After all, I could never understand the feelings of a woman trying to do a man's job."]
 73: 1539| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1542| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 75: 1568| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1571| [45] ["If you were a man, then at least I wouldn't be bumping heads with you so much, you know."]
 77: 1579| [47] [Ena]
 78: 1582| [45] ["But you're telling me I have to entrust my life to a woman, and a rookie rescue worker at that, in this kind of situation...? Things sure aren't looking up."]
 79: 1608| [47] [Ena]
 80: 1611| [45] ["Why's a woman like you even trying to be a rescue worker?"]
 81: 1619| [47] [Jun]
 82: 1622| [45] ["...!"]
 83: 1627| [45] [Jun heard her heart pound violently at those words.]
 84: 1632| [45] [Ever since Nagisa's death, Jun had dedicated herself solely to being a rescue worker, not once looking back on her decision.]
 85: 1637| [45] [And she had finally achieved that dream after impressing her peers with all the hard training and work she had endured.]
 86: 1642| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1643| [45] [(Now that she mentions it... maybe it wasn't exactly what you'd call a healthy way of living...%NBut still...)]
 88: 1648| [45] [Unpleasant emotions welled up in her chest.]
 89: 1653| [45] [But right as she was about to say all of what was on her mind--]
 90: 1686| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1689| [45] ["Wh-what happened!?"]
 92: 1722| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1725| [45] ["Moribe, what's all this commotion about!?"]
 94: 1730| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Yuuri came running over.]
 95: 1737| [45] [--Thanks to that, she avoided getting into a rather decisive quarrel with Ena--]
 96: 1742| [45] [But a silent resentment for Ena began to wrap its way around Jun's mind.]
 97: 1794| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
 98: 1799| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1800| [45] [(It feels like Jun's confidence took a bit of a blow there...)]
100: 1805| [47] [Natsuhiko]
101: 1806| [45] [(I have to adjust her feelings to put things back to the way they were!)]
