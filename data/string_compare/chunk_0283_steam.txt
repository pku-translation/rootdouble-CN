  0:   53| [45] [--And then came the day of fate.]
  1:   58| [45] [Roughy two months after Tanabata...]
  2:   63| [45] [September 16, 2030--]
  3:  128| [45] [Early morning that day, Yuuri went with Dr. Tenkawa to the neuroscience laboratory.]
  4:  160| [47] [Miyoko]
  5:  163| [45] ["Sorry for starting your day so early, Yuuri."]
  6:  171| [47] [Yuuri]
  7:  174| [45] ["It's okay. We're doing a very important experiment today, aren't we?"]
  8:  200| [47] [Miyoko]
  9:  203| [45] ["Indeed. It'll be a long stretch from around 9 to 12, so let's give it our best."]
 10:  229| [47] [Miyoko]
 11:  232| [45] ["Before the experiment, we need to examine your brain. Please change into the testing clothes."]
 12:  265| [45] [Miyoko handed Yuuri a change of clothes.]
 13:  270| [45] [In the surrounding area, the professor's colleagues were busy preparing for the examination.]
 14:  275| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 15:  278| [45] ["Scanning preparations complete."]
 16:  283| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 17:  286| [45] ["Send me the data from the previous two rounds."]
 18:  338| [45] [None of them showed any interest in seeing Yuuri's naked body, but she still tried to find cover to change behind.]
 19:  343| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  344| [45] [(But still... today's experiment is quite unusual, huh.)]
 21:  349| [47] [Yuuri]
 22:  350| [45] [(The professor said it's to "create a spirit"... but is that even possible?)]
 23:  355| [45] [The moment Yuuri pondered the possibility--]
 24:  375| [45] [The phone rang.]
 25:  408| [47] [Miyoko]
 26:  411| [45] ["... What could that be?"]
 27:  416| [45] [Puzzled, the professor picked up the phone.]
 28:  448| [47] [Miyoko]
 29:  451| [45] ["Yes. Tenkawa speaking. We're in the middle of an experiment right now, so--"]
 30:  456| [45] [Before she could finish, the professor's face froze over.]
 31:  484| [47] [Miyoko]
 32:  487| [45] ["--Natsuhiko did what?"]
 33:  495| [47] [Yuuri]
 34:  498| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 35:  509| [45] [Yuuri gasped too when she heard that name.]
 36:  533| [45] [As Yuuri strained her ears to listen, the professor continued the phone call.]
 37:  559| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  562| [45] ["Yes, yes...!"]
 39:  588| [47] [Miyoko]
 40:  591| [45] ["... What did you say? Mashiro and Yui as well?"]
 41:  617| [47] [Miyoko]
 42:  620| [45] ["--Understood. I'll be heading over there right now."]
 43:  625| [45] [And with that, the professor hung up the phone.]
 44:  633| [47] [Yuuri]
 45:  636| [45] ["U-um... what happened with Hikorin?"]
 46:  662| [47] [Miyoko]
 47:  665| [45] ["I'm not sure... but it looks like those three came to LABO."]
 48:  673| [47] [Yuuri]
 49:  676| [45] ["Huh? H-how?"]
 50:  702| [47] [Miyoko]
 51:  705| [45] ["How indeed. And right as we're running an experiment..."]
 52:  713| [47] [Miyoko]
 53:  716| [45] ["What in the world could he need at a time like--"]
 54:  721| [45] [Right as the professor spoke,]
 55:  769| [45] [the sound of an explosion rang out in the distance.]
 56:  783| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  786| [45] ["!?"]
 58:  791| [45] [Yuuri was so taken by surprised that she dropped the testing clothes she was about to change into.]
 59:  799| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  802| [45] ["Wh-what was that sound!?"]
 61:  807| [45] [As if to answer that question, more and more sounds echoed forth.]
 62:  906| [45] [The automatic disaster prevention system broadcast an automated message.]
 63:  911| [47] [Automatic PA]
 64:  914| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B1 Area 1."]
 65:  919| [47] [Automatic PA]
 66:  922| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 3."]
 67:  927| [47] [Automatic PA]
 68:  930| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 69:  935| [47] [Automatic PA]
 70:  938| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 2."]
 71:  943| [47] [Automatic PA]
 72:  946| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 73:  951| [45] [Yuuri didn't really understand what was going on.]
 74:  974| [45] [But she did know that something terrible was befalling the facility.]
 75:  982| [47] [Yuuri]
 76:  985| [45] ["P... Professor..."]
 77:  992| [45] [Yuuri became frightened and walked up to her.]
 78: 1025| [45] [The professor wrapped Yuuri in a protective embrace just as a clamorous broadcast echoed through the halls.]
 79: 1033| [47] [Announcer]
 80: 1036| [45] ["Th-this is an emergency broadcast!"]
 81: 1044| [47] [Announcer]
 82: 1047| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have just occurred within the facility!"]
 83: 1055| [47] [Announcer]
 84: 1058| [45] ["From our current understanding of the situation, explosions occurred simultaneously in ten different locations inside the facility. Fires have broken out as a result!"]
 85: 1069| [45] [That broadcast sent all the researchers panicking.]
 86: 1074| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 87: 1077| [45] ["Explosions in ten different locations...!?"]
 88: 1082| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 89: 1085| [45] ["'Unknown origin'!? What do you mean, 'unknown origin'!?"]
 90: 1108| [47] [Yuuri]
 91: 1111| [45] ["...!"]
 92: 1116| [45] [The frightened Yuuri clung to the professor.]
 93: 1121| [45] [The professor embraced her shoulders back and spoke.]
 94: 1147| [47] [Miyoko]
 95: 1150| [45] ["It's okay...! This facility's equipped with layers upon layers of disaster prevention systems."]
 96: 1158| [47] [Miyoko]
 97: 1161| [45] ["No matter what happens, it shouldn't escalate to a large-scale disaster."]
 98: 1187| [47] [Miyoko]
 99: 1190| [45] ["Our safety is guaranteed... so there's no need to worry."]
100: 1195| [45] [She spoke in a voice calm to the core. As if she were trying to encourage Yuuri.]
101: 1203| [47] [Yuuri]
102: 1206| [45] ["B-but why did this happen--"]
103: 1232| [47] [Miyoko]
104: 1235| [45] ["Why indeed. There's no reason for an explosion to have occurred in this facility..."]
105: 1261| [47] [Miyoko]
106: 1264| [45] ["..."]
107: 1290| [47] [Miyoko]
108: 1293| [45] ["... It couldn't be. Terrorism!?"]
109: 1301| [47] [Yuuri]
110: 1304| [45] ["T-terrorism!?"]
111: 1312| [47] [Miyoko]
112: 1315| [45] ["An anti-BC extremist group has been conducting acts of destruction within the city recently."]
113: 1323| [47] [Miyoko]
114: 1326| [45] ["Yesterday, they blew up the PRC and that was thought to have been the end of their string of crimes... but could it be that their actual target was here!?"]
115: 1352| [47] [Miyoko]
116: 1355| [45] ["How did they find out this place was a BC research facility!?"]
117: 1363| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1366| [45] ["W-was there an information leak somewhere!?"]
119: 1392| [47] [Miyoko]
120: 1395| [45] ["I don't know! The same goes for what their goal is..."]
121: 1421| [47] [Miyoko]
122: 1424| [45] ["But it's too dangerous for us to stay here. That's for certain!"]
123: 1432| [47] [Miyoko]
124: 1435| [45] ["Yuuri, let's evacuate to somewhere safe!"]
125: 1443| [47] [Yuuri]
126: 1446| [45] ["O-okay!"]
127: 1479| [45] [The professor took Yuuri by the hand and left the laboratory.]
128: 1537| [45] [--They ran up the emergency staircase and headed to B1 Area 5.]
129: 1545| [47] [Yuuri]
130: 1548| [45] ["Professor, where are we going!?"]
131: 1576| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1579| [45] ["There's an emergency shelter here in Area 5."]
133: 1605| [47] [Miyoko]
134: 1608| [45] ["In truth, Area Zero is the safest place, but going there requires tedious formalities..."]
135: 1642| [45] [The professor stopped and looked at the wall.]
136: 1690| [45] [There was a numeric keypad affixed to it.]
137: 1704| [47] [Miyoko]
138: 1707| [45] ["107215... Okay, it opened!"]
139: 1718| [45] [The professor entered what appeared to be a password and the wall slid open, revealing a narrow passageway.]
140: 1769| [45] [They rushed up to a steel door deep inside and opened it.]
141: 1855| [47] [Miyoko]
142: 1858| [45] ["Yuuri, I'm sorry, but hide yourself here!"]
143: 1866| [47] [Miyoko]
144: 1869| [45] ["This place was designed to withstand minor explosions and fires! It's perfectly safe!"]
145: 1877| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 1880| [45] ["A-All right!"]
147: 1906| [47] [Miyoko]
148: 1909| [45] ["I'll go investigate what's happening! And there's the issue with Natsuhiko too, so--"]
149: 1917| [47] [Miyoko]
150: 1920| [45] ["Understand? Wait for me here, okay!?"]
151: 1928| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 1931| [45] ["Understood. Be careful!"]
153: 1971| [45] [The professor nodded and left the shelter.]
154: 1982| [45] [--Yuuri was left there alone.]
155: 1987| [45] [The sound of explosions kept going on and on.]
156: 1992| [47] [Yuuri]
157: 1993| [45] [(Hikorin's here...? Why would he come now of all times...!?)]
158: 1998| [45] [Yuuri was worried about them, but she couldn't just leave the shelter.]
159: 2003| [47] [Yuuri]
160: 2004| [45] [(If I could at least confirm their safety...)]
161: 2009| [45] [As Yuuri pondered about how to do that-- it hit her.]
162: 2014| [47] [Yuuri]
163: 2015| [45] [(I know! I'll use BC!)]
164: 2022| [45] [She could confirm Natsuhiko's current situation using Senses Sympathy.]
165: 2027| [45] [Furthermore, since the facility was now in Evacuation Mode, the BC-insulated security gates were all wide open.]
166: 2032| [45] [Meaning she would in theory be able to use BC on him even if he was in a faraway area.]
167: 2096| [45] [Yuuri focused her mind-- and tried using Senses Sympathy on Natsuhiko.]
168: 2272| [45] [But the moment her senses sympathized with Natsuhiko's, an intense headache struck.]
169: 2280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2283| [45] ["Khh!"]
171: 2288| [47] [Yuuri]
172: 2289| [45] [(!)]
173: 2294| [45] [The pain Natsuhiko felt propagated to Yuuri.]
174: 2299| [45] [The girls beside him looked at him in concern.]
175: 2325| [47] [Salyu]
176: 2328| [45] ["Natsuhiko, do you have a headache again!?"]
177: 2336| [47] [Natsuhiko]
178: 2339| [45] ["Gh... guh, uuuuuuggh...!"]
179: 2365| [47] [Mashiro]
180: 2368| [45] ["Are you okay, Natsuhiko!? Hang in there!"]
181: 2402| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 2405| [45] ["..."]
183: 2410| [47] [Yuuri]
184: 2411| [45] [(Th-this headache...!)]
185: 2416| [45] [Yuuri knew the truth behind that headache.]
186: 2421| [45] [It was the headache Natsuhiko would always get when his mind was on the verge of collapse--!]
187: 2487| [45] [The moment that thought crossed her mind, they heard another explosion from nearby.]
188: 2492| [47] [Yuuri]
189: 2493| [45] [(!?)]
190: 2585| [45] [Natsuhiko promptly covered for Mashiro and Yui.]
191: 2672| [45] [One second later, a blazing wind shot by, and the kids were blown away.]
192: 2806| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2809| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
194: 2817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
195: 2820| [45] ["A-are you two okay!?"]
196: 2825| [45] [They slowly got up after having fallen on top of each other.]
197: 2859| [47] [Salyu]
198: 2862| [45] ["... Y... yeah..."]
199: 2896| [47] [Mashiro]
200: 2899| [45] ["I-I'm okay...!"]
201: 2904| [45] [The two groaned, but they appeared to be uninjured.]
202: 2909| [47] [Yuuri]
203: 2910| [45] [(Thank goodness...!)]
204: 2964| [45] [Yuuri felt relieved as the three kids ran around, searching for an exit.]
205: 3018| [45] [She didn't understand what their objective was.]
206: 3023| [45] [But Yuuri had a lone desire.]
207: 3028| [47] [Yuuri]
208: 3029| [45] [(I need to get those three out of here as soon as possible...!)]
209: 3093| [45] [Yuuri focused further and sent Natsuhiko telepathy.]
210: 3182| [45] [--Intense telepathy that worked not only to cause an auditory hallucination, but a visual one as well--!]
211: 3400| [47] [Natsuhiko]
212: 3403| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
213: 3411| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3414| [45] ["--Yuuri!?"]
215: 3419| [45] [Natsuhiko stopped in his tracks, speechless.]
216: 3424| [45] [His eyes were no doubt "seeing" Yuuri.]
217: 3451| [47] [Yuuri]
218: 3454| [45] [{... Hikorin...}]
219: 3462| [47] [Yuuri]
220: 3465| [45] [{Why did you come here...!?}]
221: 3473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3476| [45] ["What about you, Yuuri!? Why are -you- here!?"]
223: 3484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3487| [45] ["You left home!?"]
225: 3492| [45] [Yuuri was holding a conversation with him without issue. Though she was relieved, she had other thoughts on her mind as well.]
226: 3497| [47] [Yuuri]
227: 3498| [45] [(First I need to find the reason Hikorin came to LABO-- and with that information, I need to think of a way to get him to leave!)]
228: 3601| [45] [Yuuri immediately peered into Natsuhiko's memory.]
229: 3941| [45] [She looked through his memories of what he experienced the previous few days.]
230: 4279| [45] [How he came across a traffic accident. How he met Salyu.]
231: 4618| [45] [How he heard about the terrorists from Mashiro, and how they came to LABO to stop them--]
232: 4995| [45] [--but were one step behind and the terrorist attack proceeded.]
233: 5000| [45] [The watch that broke and stopped at that time left a severe impression.]
234: 5121| [45] [--Once she had caught all of the details, Yuuri murmured in admiration and surprise.]
235: 5129| [47] [Yuuri]
236: 5132| [45] ["So that's what happened..."]
237: 5137| [45] [Those words were heard by Natsuhiko as well via BC.]
238: 5184| [47] [Yuuri]
239: 5185| [45] [(What do I do...!?)]
240: 5190| [45] [Now that she had understood the situation, Yuuri was at a loss for how to proceed.]
241: 5195| [45] [The first thing on the agenda would probably be to get them out safely.]
242: 5200| [45] [But there was something else that was equally important.]
243: 5205| [47] [Yuuri]
244: 5206| [45] [(Hikorin's trying to regain his memories!)]
245: 5211| [45] [Natsuhiko had been tormented by his frequently chaotic memory for some time.]
246: 5216| [45] [He still lacked any of the "preparedness to know the truth" that the professor had talked about.]
247: 5221| [45] [But if he were to fall victim to his panic disorder or stupefaction in this situation, it would mean certain death.]
248: 5226| [45] [After all, he'd nearly gotten caught in an explosive blast mere moments ago.]
249: 5231| [47] [Yuuri]
250: 5232| [45] [(If something were to happen to him, then even Mashiron and Yui could get caught up in it...!)]
251: 5336| [45] [And even if the three of them did escape, Natsuhiko would eventually regain his memory of nine years ago regardless.]
252: 5341| [45] [And then his mind would collapse yet again.]
253: 5346| [45] [In light of the impending crisis-- there was only one path for Yuuri to take.]
254: 5351| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 5352| [45] [(In that case, I'll start now...)]
256: 5357| [47] [Yuuri]
257: 5358| [45] [(And manipulate Hikorin's memory to give him the strength he needs to handle the truth...!)]
258: 5363| [45] [She didn't know how much time was left.]
259: 5368| [45] [But it was something that needed to be done while she guided them down an escape route.]
260: 5373| [45] [It was the only way.]
261: 5427| [47] [Yuuri]
262: 5428| [45] [(Hikorin has so many people there to support him now.)]
263: 5494| [47] [Yuuri]
264: 5495| [45] [(As long as Mashiron and Yui are there for him, I'm sure Hikorin can handle the truth!)]
265: 5500| [45] [To get him to accept the truth and free him from her curse--]
266: 5592| [47] [Yuuri]
267: 5595| [45] ["I'll rewind time for Hikorin, as many times as it takes...!"]
