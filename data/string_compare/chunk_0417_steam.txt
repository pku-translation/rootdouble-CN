  2:  129| [47] [[--Memories with Kazami Tachibana--]]
  3:  210| [45] [--As Watase walked out the prison's back gate, the prison guard gave him the same tired line he gave everybody.]
  4:  215| [47] [Prison Guard]
  5:  218| [45] ["--And don't you ever come back, you hear?"]
  6:  226| [47] [Watase]
  7:  229| [45] ["But of course."]
  8:  237| [47] [Watase]
  9:  240| [45] ["... Thanks for all your help."]
 10:  245| [45] [Watase deeply bowed his head when he said that...]
 11:  250| [45] [Then turned around and walked out into the outside world for the first time in about a year.]
 12:  255| [45] [He took a great deep breath.]
 13:  263| [47] [Watase]
 14:  266| [45] ["Wheeeew... fresh air really does taste the best."]
 15:  271| [45] [That line was just as cliched as the guard's had been, but he was only being half serious.]
 16:  279| [47] [Watase]
 17:  282| [45] ["Well then... what to do now...?"]
 18:  287| [45] [He was glad he was finally out, but he didn't have a place to stay the night.]
 19:  320| [45] [The plan had been for Ena to pick him up and take him to his new temporary residence--]
 20:  325| [45] [But she was nowhere to be found.]
 21:  364| [47] [Watase]
 22:  365| [45] [(Did something come up...?)]
 23:  370| [45] [Just as he thought that, a voice called out to him from behind.]
 24:  380| [47] [???]
 25:  383| [45] ["Watase."]
 26:  406| [47] [Watase]
 27:  409| [45] ["..."]
 28:  468| [45] [Watase turned around in surprise to see--]
 29:  473| [45] [None other than Kazami standing there.]
 30:  503| [47] [Watase]
 31:  506| [45] ["Kazami... why are you here...?"]
 32:  514| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  517| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama told me you were being released today."]
 34:  525| [47] [Watase]
 35:  528| [45] ["What?"]
 36:  539| [45] [Ena was being far too considerate.]
 37:  544| [45] [She'd gone ahead and arranged for this even though Watase hadn't asked for it--]
 38:  552| [47] [Watase]
 39:  555| [45] ["Wait... more importantly, is it okay for you to even be here!?"]
 40:  563| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  566| [45] ["What do you mean?"]
 42:  574| [47] [Watase]
 43:  577| [45] ["Aren't you being targeted by the press, or all sorts of examination authorities, or whatever?"]
 44:  582| [45] [Kazami was currently one of the few Ability Level 6 Communicators in all of Japan.]
 45:  587| [45] [Though she was keeping that a secret from the world, she was also one of the victims of the LABO incident.]
 46:  592| [45] [Watase had heard from Ena that she'd been living a secluded life, just like Natsuhiko and the others.]
 47:  597| [45] [That's why she'd never come to visit Watase in prison, and why he thought he'd never see her again...]
 48:  605| [47] [Watase]
 49:  608| [45] ["You realize what kinds of articles they'll write if they find out you've met up with someone who literally just got out of prison?"]
 50:  616| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  619| [45] ["I don't care."]
 52:  627| [47] [Watase]
 53:  630| [45] ["I can't let you act that way. Even the ESP Bureau's keeping an eye on--"]
 54:  679| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  682| [45] ["Didn't you hear me? I just said I don't care."]
 56:  687| [45] [The force in Kazami's voice discouraged him from speaking further.]
 57:  692| [45] [Watase swallowed what he had been about to say and watched silently.]
 58:  741| [47] [Kazami]
 59:  744| [45] ["None of that matters to me...!"]
 60:  752| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  755| [45] ["Because... I've been waiting for this day for a long time."]
 62:  760| [45] [Watase just then noticed that her eyes were brimming with tears.]
 63:  768| [47] [Watase]
 64:  771| [45] ["... Kazami."]
 65:  779| [47] [Kazami]
 66:  782| [45] ["You don't know just how much I missed you, do you?"]
 67:  790| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  793| [45] ["First you suddenly break up with me two years ago, then I finally learned the reason why after a year of waiting..."]
 69:  801| [47] [Kazami]
 70:  804| [45] ["And the moment I thought we could get a fresh start together, you disappear again..."]
 71:  855| [47] [Kazami]
 72:  858| [45] ["I've had it up to here with your selfishness!"]
 73:  866| [47] [Watase]
 74:  869| [45] ["!"]
 75:  877| [47] [Kazami]
 76:  880| [45] ["I finally meet you again for the first time in a year, and what do I get? No words of comfort, just the cold shoulder!"]
 77:  888| [47] [Kazami]
 78:  891| [45] ["The ESP Bureau and the media can go to hell for all I care! None of that matters to me!"]
 79:  899| [47] [Kazami]
 80:  902| [45] ["You met with Ms. Tsubakiyama all the time, yet you never sent me a single letter!"]
 81:  910| [47] [Watase]
 82:  913| [45] ["Ah, well... I'm sorry about that."]
 83:  918| [45] [A year of pent up emotions from Kazami came shooting out of her mouth all at once.]
 84:  923| [45] [Watase was stunned by the look on her face. He'd never seen that kind of expression from her ever before.]
 85:  961| [47] [Kazami]
 86:  964| [45] ["Besides, don't you remember our promise!?"]
 87:  972| [47] [Kazami]
 88:  975| [45] ["Don't you remember what you said back when we kissed in the engine room!?"]
 89:  983| [47] [Kazami]
 90:  986| [45] ["You said 'let's go for a walk through that park again if we make it out of here', remember!?"]
 91:  994| [47] [Watase]
 92:  997| [45] ["O-of course I do! I remember, but--"]
 93: 1002| [45] [Watase's face suddenly grew dead serious as he tried to calm Kazami.]
 94: 1010| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1013| [45] ["... Don't you get it, Kazami? I'm an ex-convict."]
 96: 1021| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1024| [45] ["What's worse, I'm the terrorist who destroyed LABO, and from Q's perspective, I'm a traitor."]
 98: 1032| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1035| [45] ["There are probably guys in the Rokumei City government and Q who hate my guts. Some probably even want me dead."]
100: 1043| [47] [Watase]
101: 1046| [45] ["You could never be happy being with someone like me."]
102: 1093| [47] [Kazami]
103: 1096| [45] ["You idiot. Do you really think a wimpy little threat like that is all it'll take to get me to leave you?"]
104: 1104| [47] [Watase]
105: 1107| [45] ["'Wimpy'... are you..."]
106: 1115| [47] [Kazami]
107: 1118| [45] ["I've grown strong, you know."]
108: 1126| [47] [Kazami]
109: 1129| [45] ["I spent three months in tears after losing Nagisa again..."]
110: 1137| [47] [Kazami]
111: 1140| [45] ["But I was able to overcome that even without you around."]
112: 1187| [47] [Kazami]
113: 1190| [45] ["I'm no longer the kind of woman who'll just keep waiting for you."]
114: 1198| [47] [Kazami]
115: 1201| [45] ["From now on, I'm sticking with you no matter how much you protest."]
116: 1211| [45] [Kazami stared Watase dead in the eye.]
117: 1216| [45] [There was indeed a strong light in her eyes, but--]
118: 1221| [47] [Watase]
119: 1222| [45] [(... There's that part about her where she pushes herself too far.)]
120: 1227| [45] [Watase knew that.]
121: 1237| [45] [Kazami was probably under the surveillance of BC officials throughout Japan.]
122: 1242| [45] [Just like Natsuhiko and the others were.]
123: 1247| [45] [He didn't expect there to be any woman who could live under that kind of pressure all by herself.]
124: 1252| [45] [Yet she pushed all that aside, went to see Watase, and bared these feelings to him for the first time in her life.]
125: 1257| [45] [Watase felt heartfelt respect for her resolve.]
126: 1267| [47] [Watase]
127: 1270| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Kazami."]
128: 1278| [47] [Watase]
129: 1281| [45] ["I'm sorry I kept you waiting for a year. I'll keep my promise."]
130: 1292| [45] [Watase said that, then looked at Kazami.]
131: 1297| [45] [--She was no ordinary woman.]
132: 1302| [45] [She was a Level 6 Communicator who had once hated Watase enough to want him dead.]
133: 1307| [45] [Neither of them knew if she'd one day become N-ified. Perhaps she would turn into an uncontrollable monster.]
134: 1312| [45] [But despite that--]
135: 1317| [45] [Watase wanted to respond to her feelings earnestly.]
136: 1325| [47] [Watase]
137: 1328| [45] ["... However, I'm not going to suggest we start dating again."]
138: 1375| [47] [Kazami]
139: 1378| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
140: 1386| [47] [Watase]
141: 1389| [45] ["I don't want you to be my girlfriend."]
142: 1395| [45] [Watase said that, walked up to Kazami--]
143: 1421| [45] [And embraced her.]
144: 1429| [47] [Watase]
145: 1432| [45] ["Kazami, will you marry me?"]
146: 1482| [47] [Kazami]
147: 1485| [45] ["..."]
148: 1490| [45] [The woman in his arms gasped.]
149: 1536| [45] [Before long, she gave him the biggest, most relieved smile he had ever seen from her.]
150: 1544| [47] [Kazami]
151: 1547| [45] ["--I will."]
