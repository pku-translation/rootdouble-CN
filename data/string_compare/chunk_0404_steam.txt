  1:   59| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  2:   60| [45] [(The ones of us who can use Senses Sympathy will stay...!?)]
  3:   65| [45] [He considered the idea for a moment.]
  4:  123| [45] [But he didn't quite understand what Kazami was thinking.]
  5:  205| [45] [When he looked at her and tried to ask, he received telepathy from her.]
  6:  235| [47] [Kazami]
  7:  238| [45] [{Tenkawa, please calm down and listen...}]
  8:  243| [47] [Kazami]
  9:  246| [45] [{I've thought of just one way to make sure everyone survives.}]
 10:  254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 11:  257| [45] [{Huh!?}]
 12:  262| [45] [Natsuhiko's eyes widened at those words.]
 13:  286| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  289| [45] [{But we have to stay down here for it to work.}]
 15:  297| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  300| [45] [{H-hey, wait a second!}]
 17:  308| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  311| [45] [{How does us staying down here relate to everyone's survival?}]
 19:  335| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  338| [45] [{It doesn't matter who stays behind, but regardless of who says they will, it'll cause an intense argument, won't it?}]
 21:  343| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  346| [45] [{It'll be fatal to waste any time in this situation.}]
 23:  370| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  373| [45] [{But we have a means to "persuade" everyone smoothly.}]
 25:  381| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  384| [45] [{...!}]
 27:  389| [45] [Once he heard that, Natsuhiko finally understood what Kazami was getting at.]
 28:  397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  400| [45] [{You mean we'll "persuade" everyone with memory manipulation...!?}]
 30:  424| [47] [Kazami]
 31:  427| [45] [{Yes.}]
 32:  451| [47] [Kazami]
 33:  454| [45] [{If I say I'll stay, then Watase and Jun wouldn't agree to it, see?}]
 34:  478| [47] [Kazami]
 35:  481| [45] [{But if we change that problem at its source-- Say we cleverly falsify my relationship with them--}]
 36:  486| [47] [Kazami]
 37:  489| [45] [{Then we should be able to persuade them without question.}]
 38:  494| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  495| [45] [{...}]
 40:  519| [47] [Kazami]
 41:  522| [45] [{... Please understand, Tenkawa. We don't have time.}]
 42:  527| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  530| [45] [{I don't want Watase or Jun to die. Nor any of the others, obviously.}]
 44:  554| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  557| [45] [{Tenkawa, you don't want Ms. Toba or Ms. Sannomiya to die either, do you?}]
 46:  562| [47] [Kazami]
 47:  565| [45] [{This is the only way we can prevent those deaths.}]
 48:  570| [45] [Kazami's resolve propagated to Natsuhiko along with her words.]
 49:  575| [45] [But Natsuhiko remained prudent and asked more questions.]
 50:  583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  586| [45] [{... So if you, Yuuri, and I will stay down here...}]
 52:  594| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  597| [45] [{Is there a way for us to live?}]
 54:  621| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  624| [45] [{I have an abundance of knowledge regarding explosives thanks to my line of work.}]
 56:  629| [47] [Kazami]
 57:  632| [45] [{I've been thinking of places where an explosion from Area Zero wouldn't reach.}]
 58:  640| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59:  643| [45] [{Are there any!?}]
 60:  697| [47] [Kazami]
 61:  700| [45] [{Yes. The small cargo lift room in the factory.}]
 62:  705| [47] [Kazami]
 63:  708| [45] [{I think we'll be fine if we go there, but just in case, I'd like to get the other six out of here first...}]
 64:  766| [47] [Kazami]
 65:  769| [45] [{That's my plan.}]
 66:  774| [47] [Kazami]
 67:  777| [45] [{Can I trust in you...!?}]
 68:  782| [45] [Kazami looked at Natsuhiko.]
 69:  787| [45] [There was not a shade of hesitation in her eyes.]
 70:  792| [45] [They were the eyes of a woman who constantly put her life on the line to save lives.]
 71:  797| [45] [When he looked into her eyes, Natsuhiko felt he could trust in her.]
 72:  805| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  808| [45] [{I understand... I'll join you in your wager, Ms. Tachibana.}]
 74:  816| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75:  819| [45] [{Please tell me the details of the alterations.}]
 76:  843| [47] [Kazami]
 77:  846| [45] [{...! Thank you for your cooperation!}]
 78:  851| [45] [Kazami bowed her head and then explained the essentials of the plan.]
 79:  875| [47] [Kazami]
 80:  878| [45] [{The key is to falsify everyone's memories at roughly the same time.}]
 81:  883| [47] [Kazami]
 82:  886| [45] [{A time difference would inevitably cause at least one person to make a commotion.}]
 83:  891| [47] [Kazami]
 84:  894| [45] [{So the three of us, that is, you, Ms. Yuuri, and I, will each alter two people's memories.}]
 85:  902| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 86:  905| [45] [{And the details of the alterations?}]
 87:  929| [47] [Kazami]
 88:  932| [45] [{We should give the six of them a memory that will cause them to escape without worrying about us--}]
 89:  937| [47] [Kazami]
 90:  940| [45] [{In other words "There is no bomb".}]
 91:  945| [47] [Kazami]
 92:  948| [45] [{We'll replace it with the false information that "unless three people open the bulkheads from the control room, they won't open for another 24 hours".}]
 93:  953| [47] [Kazami]
 94:  956| [45] [{If we convey that information to them, then I'm sure they'll leave without issue.}]
 95:  964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 96:  967| [45] [{...!}]
 97:  972| [45] [Natsuhiko was a little uneasy about it, but there didn't seem to be any other option.]
 98:  977| [45] [He now had the same kind of resolve that Kazami did.]
 99:  985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100:  988| [45] [{Roger! Should I tell Yuuri the same thing!?}]
101: 1012| [47] [Kazami]
102: 1015| [45] [{Please do!}]
103: 1078| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded and sent telepathy to Yuuri.]
104: 1139| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1142| [45] [{Yuuri, can you hear me!?}]
106: 1171| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1174| [45] [{Huh?}]
108: 1182| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1185| [45] [{Ms. Tachibana thought of a way to get everyone to survive just now.}]
110: 1193| [47] [Natsuhiko]
111: 1196| [45] [{And that way is--}]
112: 1201| [45] [Natsuhiko explained Kazami's proposal to Yuuri.]
113: 1206| [45] [Yuuri quickly accepted that proposal.]
114: 1230| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1233| [45] [{... Yeah, that's something only we can do, huh?}]
116: 1241| [47] [Natsuhiko]
117: 1244| [45] [{Yeah...!}]
118: 1268| [47] [Yuuri]
119: 1271| [45] [{Okay. Then I'll take care of Mashiron and Salyu.}]
120: 1279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
121: 1282| [45] [{Okay, I'll cover Prof. Tsubakiyama and Mr. Ukita.}]
122: 1315| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at Kazami and conveyed Yuuri's thoughts.]
123: 1353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 1356| [45] [{Ms. Tachibana, Yuuri agreed.}]
125: 1364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1367| [45] [{Let's all alter everyone's memories together.}]
127: 1375| [47] [Natsuhiko]
128: 1378| [45] [{Ms. Tachibana, can you take care of Watase and Jun?}]
129: 1402| [47] [Kazami]
130: 1405| [45] [{... Yes. I'll try.}]
131: 1470| [45] [The three nodded at each other and stepped up to the other six.]
132: 1526| [47] [Watase]
133: 1529| [45] ["...? What's wrong, guys?"]
134: 1555| [47] [Ena]
135: 1558| [45] ["Think of something?"]
136: 1566| [47] [Natsuhiko]
137: 1569| [45] ["Yeah, we did think..."]
138: 1577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1580| [45] ["of a way for everyone to survive."]
140: 1585| [45] [Natsuhiko answered--]
141: 1590| [45] [And they began memory manipulation.]
142: 1673| [45] [--First, he instantly altered Ena's memory and erased all knowledge of the tetryl bomb from her brain.]
143: 1678| [45] [And he replaced it with false memories concerning the opening of the bulkheads.]
144: 1736| [45] [He then dove into Ukita's memory and did the same falsification.]
145: 1741| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 1742| [45] [(Okay, that takes care of my share!)]
147: 1882| [45] [--Natsuhiko returned to reality.]
148: 1986| [45] [He saw Watase and the other five blinking in confusion.]
149: 1991| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 1992| [45] [(Did it work...!?)]
151: 1997| [45] [Natsuhiko timidly tried asking them.]
152: 2005| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2008| [45] ["... So, guys...."]
154: 2016| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2019| [45] ["The three of us will stay down here and open the bulkheads... That okay...?"]
156: 2045| [47] [Watase]
157: 2048| [45] ["Right... Someone's gotta do it."]
158: 2074| [47] [Mashiro]
159: 2077| [45] ["It's gotta be tough to be locked in here for 24 hours, huh..."]
160: 2103| [47] [Salyu]
161: 2106| [45] ["Mm, you'll get hungry."]
162: 2131| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2134| [45] ["!"]
164: 2145| [45] ["Hungry" was a word that really showed how unfazed Salyu was.]
165: 2150| [45] [When Natsuhiko heard that word, he knew for sure that the memory falsification had succeeded.]
166: 2155| [47] [Natsuhiko]
167: 2156| [45] [(We did it!)]
168: 2386| [45] [He exchanged looks with Yuuri and Kazami and then began to speak.]
169: 2477| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 2480| [45] ["Right! So we'll open the bulkheads!"]
171: 2513| [47] [Yuuri]
172: 2516| [45] ["Everyone else, please escape before us!"]
173: 2549| [47] [Ukita]
174: 2552| [45] ["Very well...!"]
175: 2578| [47] [Jun]
176: 2581| [45] ["B-but... wouldn't it be better if we all waited the 24 hours together...?"]
177: 2607| [47] [Ena]
178: 2610| [45] ["Exactly. It'd be better than us splitting up."]
179: 2636| [47] [Ukita]
180: 2639| [45] ["I don't see why it has to be you three in particular."]
181: 2681| [47] [Kazami]
182: 2684| [45] ["No, this is the best plan."]
183: 2692| [47] [Kazami]
184: 2695| [45] ["If all of us wait here the 24 hours, it would lower everyone's stamina."]
185: 2721| [47] [Kazami]
186: 2724| [45] ["That would increase the difficulty in getting away from Security Sector 6, wouldn't it?"]
187: 2732| [47] [Kazami]
188: 2735| [45] ["The three of us are high level Communicators. At the very least, the security department's got their eyes on us."]
189: 2743| [47] [Kazami]
190: 2746| [45] ["Security Sector 6 will target us three... so if we all move together, there's a higher possibility that we'll hold each other back."]
191: 2772| [47] [Kazami]
192: 2775| [45] ["Captain, please report the situation to the Commander and get the others' support."]
193: 2801| [47] [Watase]
194: 2804| [45] ["...!"]
195: 2809| [45] [Kazami's stifled voice seemed to overpower Watase and the others.]
196: 2835| [47] [Watase]
197: 2838| [45] ["... Guess we've got no choice, then."]
198: 2864| [47] [Ena]
199: 2867| [45] ["... Indeed."]
200: 2872| [45] [Everyone nodded at those words.]
201: 3005| [45] [Since they were under the impression that there was no bomb, they didn't put up as much of a resistance.]
202: 3058| [45] [Mashiro and Salyu spoke to Natsuhiko and Yuuri.]
203: 3066| [47] [Mashiro]
204: 3069| [45] ["Natsuhiko, Yuuri... I'm sorry for entrusting such a tough role to you..."]
205: 3077| [47] [Salyu]
206: 3080| [45] ["I think it'll be tough to wait for 24 hours..."]
207: 3088| [47] [Natsuhiko]
208: 3091| [45] ["But once this is over, we can all go home."]
209: 3117| [47] [Yuuri]
210: 3120| [45] ["That's right, Hikorin. You, me, Mashiron, and Salyu can all go home."]
211: 3178| [45] [Next was Ukita and Ena.]
212: 3219| [47] [Ukita]
213: 3222| [45] ["I'm sorry, you two... We've gotten so far, and yet we can't all escape together..."]
214: 3248| [47] [Ena]
215: 3251| [45] ["But we'll come save you later for sure."]
216: 3259| [47] [Ena]
217: 3262| [45] ["I'll get backup from the ESP Bureau and come back here in the next 24 hours to make that happen, okay?"]
218: 3270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 3273| [45] ["We're counting on you, Professor."]
220: 3278| [45] [Natsuhiko answered with a smile.]
221: 3411| [45] [Finally, Watase and Jun spoke to Kazami.]
222: 3467| [47] [Jun]
223: 3470| [45] ["Lieutenant... Please take care of Natsuhiko and Yuuri."]
224: 3496| [47] [Watase]
225: 3499| [45] ["It's my fault that you have to put up with this responsibility..."]
226: 3525| [47] [Watase]
227: 3528| [45] ["I swear I'll make it up to you outside."]
228: 3554| [47] [Kazami]
229: 3557| [45] ["Yes, please do."]
230: 3562| [45] [Kazami spoke coldly.]
231: 3567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 3568| [45] [(...?)]
233: 3573| [45] [That exchange made Natsuhiko feel uncomfortable.]
234: 3578| [45] [There was something strange about what Jun and Watase had said.]
235: 3661| [45] [But Kazami spoke to everyone before he had a chance to ask.]
236: 3689| [47] [Kazami]
237: 3692| [45] ["Now then, everyone! We'll open the bulkheads!"]
238: 3700| [47] [Kazami]
239: 3703| [45] ["Captain, Moribe, Ms. Tsubakiyama, Mr. Ukita, Ms. Toba, Ms. Sannomiya. Please escape!"]
240: 3831| [47] [All 6]
241: 3834| [45] ["Yeah!"]
242: 3868| [45] [The six responded enthusiastically and rushed out of the control room.]
243: 3908| [45] [After those six left, Kazami spoke to Natsuhiko and Yuuri.]
244: 3916| [47] [Kazami]
245: 3919| [45] ["... Now then, Tenkawa, Ms. Yuuri. Please stand by at the terminals."]
246: 3927| [47] [Kazami]
247: 3930| [45] ["Let's open the bulkheads in precisely three minutes!"]
248: 3938| [47] [Natsuhiko]
249: 3941| [45] ["R-right."]
250: 3967| [47] [Yuuri]
251: 3970| [45] ["Got it."]
252: 4130| [45] [Natsuhiko stood in front of the terminals as told.]
253: 4135| [45] [As he waited for the designated time to come, he questioned Kazami.]
254: 4161| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 4164| [45] ["... Ms. Tachibana. About Watase and Jun..."]
256: 4172| [47] [Natsuhiko]
257: 4175| [45] ["Don't you think those two were acting kind of bizarre?"]
258: 4201| [47] [Kazami]
259: 4204| [45] ["What about them?"]
260: 4212| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 4215| [45] ["Well, like--"]
262: 4223| [47] [Natsuhiko]
263: 4226| [45] ["Why did Jun call you 'Lieutenant'?"]
264: 4234| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 4237| [45] ["She'd been calling you 'Sis' up until then."]
266: 4245| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 4248| [45] ["And Watase's behavior seemed a little flat or something..."]
268: 4309| [47] [Kazami]
269: 4312| [45] ["...!"]
270: 4317| [45] [Kazami's eyebrows twitched at those words.]
271: 4343| [47] [Kazami]
272: 4346| [45] ["... I went ahead and did a few more alterations to their memory."]
273: 4354| [47] [Kazami]
274: 4357| [45] ["Alterations regarding their relationship to me..."]
275: 4365| [47] [Kazami]
276: 4368| [45] ["'I am simply Watase's subordinate.' 'Jun and I are nothing close to sisters, just coworkers.'"]
277: 4376| [47] [Kazami]
278: 4379| [45] ["I diluted our relations in that fashion."]
279: 4387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 4390| [45] ["F... for what purpose?"]
281: 4413| [47] [Kazami]
282: 4414| [45] ["..."]
283: 4419| [45] [Kazami didn't answer. Instead--]
284: 4445| [47] [Kazami]
285: 4448| [45] ["--It's time. Open the bulkheads!"]
286: 4456| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 4459| [45] ["!! Right!"]
288: 4499| [45] [Natsuhiko operated Brain Cell as told.]
289: 4504| [45] [They stole root authority, canceled the Case N declaration, and opened the bulkheads.]
290: 4509| [45] [They had no means of checking if Watase and the others had escaped, but--]
291: 4517| [47] [Natsuhiko]
292: 4520| [45] ["... They all got out of there, didn't they?"]
293: 4547| [47] [Yuuri]
294: 4550| [45] ["Yes. I'm sure..."]
295: 4555| [45] [After they had said that, Kazami spoke up.]
296: 4581| [47] [Kazami]
297: 4584| [45] ["... Now then, let's make survival preparations."]
298: 4592| [47] [Natsuhiko]
299: 4595| [45] ["Yeah."]
300: 4605| [47] [Kazami]
301: 4608| [45] ["The time is '6:07'. Only 10 minutes until detonation..."]
302: 4616| [47] [Kazami]
303: 4619| [45] ["I'll take you two to the cargo lift immediately."]
304: 4645| [47] [Yuuri]
305: 4648| [45] ["..."]
306: 4653| [45] [An uneasy expression rose on Yuuri's face, but Kazami smiled at her.]
307: 4679| [47] [Kazami]
308: 4682| [45] ["... Please relax, Ms. Yuuri."]
309: 4708| [47] [Kazami]
310: 4711| [45] ["I won't let you die, I swear."]
311: 4719| [47] [Kazami]
312: 4722| [45] ["I won't let you think that it's okay for you to die just because you're a Communicator."]
313: 4727| [45] [Her expression was gentle, but on the other hand, her voice was oozing with determination.]
314: 4787| [45] [--And thus, they moved to the cargo lift room.]
315: 4932| [45] [Once they arrived there, Kazami opened the door to the cargo lift and set it so that it would not close.]
316: 4970| [45] [She then removed the ceiling boards of the cargo lift cage.]
317: 4998| [47] [Kazami]
318: 5001| [45] ["Explosions always spread up and out."]
319: 5009| [47] [Kazami]
320: 5012| [45] ["So if we create a route for the explosion to escape, it should increase our safety."]
321: 5019| [45] [But by the time she had finished her work, there were only five minutes left until detonation.]
322: 5024| [45] [Kazami took a deep breath and spoke.]
323: 5052| [47] [Kazami]
324: 5055| [45] ["... Now it's complete."]
325: 5081| [47] [Kazami]
326: 5084| [45] ["But to ensure we have the greatest safety possible, let's move as deep into the room as we can."]
327: 5092| [47] [Natsuhiko]
328: 5095| [45] ["Y-yes."]
329: 5129| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri nervously sat with their backs to the deepest wall in the room.]
330: 5158| [47] [Yuuri]
331: 5161| [45] ["So now we just wait..."]
332: 5166| [45] [Yuuri murmured that stiffly.]
333: 5171| [45] [Time slowly ticked by.]
334: 5176| [45] [How many more minutes until detonation?]
335: 5209| [45] [A sudden anxiety welled up in Natsuhiko's heart.]
336: 5214| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 5215| [45] [(Will we really be safe here...!?)]
338: 5220| [45] [Right when Natsuhiko thought that--]
339: 5266| [45] [Kazami embraced the two children from the front.]
340: 5274| [47] [Natsuhiko]
341: 5277| [45] ["!!"]
342: 5282| [45] [Kazami's arms were trembling.]
343: 5287| [45] [Once Natsuhiko noticed that, he softly spoke.]
344: 5295| [47] [Natsuhiko]
345: 5298| [45] ["... Ms. Tachibana, you're scared too, aren't you?"]
346: 5325| [47] [Kazami]
347: 5328| [45] ["... No."]
348: 5355| [47] [Yuuri]
349: 5358| [45] ["But you're trembling..."]
350: 5385| [47] [Kazami]
351: 5388| [45] ["I'm okay. We'll survive for sure."]
352: 5393| [45] [Kazami answered clearly.]
353: 5420| [47] [Kazami]
354: 5423| [45] ["There's something here that's actually more effective as explosion protection than you would think."]
355: 5431| [47] [Kazami]
356: 5434| [45] ["And that something will protect you two."]
357: 5442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
358: 5445| [45] ["Huh...? What's that?"]
359: 5472| [47] [Kazami]
360: 5475| [45] ["Hee hee, you don't know, do you?"]
361: 5502| [47] [Kazami]
362: 5505| [45] ["Wood and iron aren't actually all that effective as explosion protection."]
363: 5513| [47] [Kazami]
364: 5516| [45] ["In the event of an explosion, they're actually more dangerous because they could break into shrapnel and spread further."]
365: 5524| [47] [Kazami]
366: 5527| [45] ["... Hard objects won't keep you safe."]
367: 5535| [47] [Kazami]
368: 5538| [45] ["You need something moderately soft and fluid..."]
369: 5546| [47] [Natsuhiko]
370: 5549| [45] ["...!"]
371: 5554| [45] [Anxiety filled Natsuhiko's heart once again.]
372: 5559| [45] [Yuuri squeezed out a question.]
373: 5586| [47] [Yuuri]
374: 5589| [45] ["Wait, Ms. Tachibana... something soft? You don't mean...!"]
375: 5616| [47] [Kazami]
376: 5619| [45] ["Yes, a human body."]
377: 5642| [47] [Natsuhiko]
378: 5645| [45] ["...!"]
379: 5650| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped as Kazami continued.]
380: 5677| [47] [Kazami]
381: 5680| [45] ["It might come as a surprise, but for example, by falling on a grenade, a human body can completely absorb the explosion, you know?"]
382: 5688| [47] [Kazami]
383: 5691| [45] ["And since human bodies are mostly water, explosions doesn't easily shatter them into dangerous shrapnel."]
384: 5699| [47] [Kazami]
385: 5702| [45] ["So as long as you're in my arms, you're safe--"]
386: 5710| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 5713| [45] ["Wh-what are you saying!?"]
388: 5721| [47] [Natsuhiko]
389: 5724| [45] ["That means you'll be giving up your life so that we might live, doesn't it!?"]
390: 5751| [47] [Kazami]
391: 5754| [45] ["No, this is just insurance. Even if I didn't do this, the explosion shouldn't reach this far."]
392: 5781| [47] [Yuuri]
393: 5784| [45] ["Then why are you trembling...!?"]
394: 5848| [47] [Kazami]
395: 5851| [45] ["...!"]
396: 5856| [45] [Yuuri's question silenced Kazami.]
397: 5861| [45] [After a short silence, Kazami whispered.]
398: 5894| [47] [Kazami]
399: 5897| [45] ["... I'm sorry. I lied."]
400: 5905| [47] [Kazami]
401: 5908| [45] ["There is no guaranteed safe place in this facility."]
402: 5935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
403: 5938| [45] ["No way!"]
404: 5958| [45] [Natsuhiko tried to shake Kazami off, but--]
405: 5985| [47] [Kazami]
406: 5988| [45] ["Please don't struggle!!"]
407: 6158| [45] [Kazami shouted and pushed Natsuhiko down.]
408: 6166| [47] [Kazami]
409: 6169| [45] ["Tenkawa, Ms. Yuuri... Please allow me to do this."]
410: 6177| [47] [Natsuhiko]
411: 6180| [45] ["Huh...?"]
412: 6188| [47] [Kazami]
413: 6191| [45] ["... I couldn't save that girl... my little sister..."]
414: 6196| [45] [Kazami whispered that in a fading voice.]
415: 6204| [47] [Kazami]
416: 6207| [45] ["She died here. Right in front of my eyes..."]
417: 6215| [47] [Kazami]
418: 6218| [45] ["... Nagisa died. Just because she was a Communicator."]
419: 6226| [47] [Kazami]
420: 6229| [45] ["That's why... at the very least, I want you two to survive no matter what."]
421: 6234| [45] [Kazami embraced the two children even tighter, as if to stop herself from trembling.]
422: 6242| [47] [Natsuhiko]
423: 6245| [45] ["... Ms. Tachibana."]
424: 6253| [47] [Kazami]
425: 6256| [45] ["... I'm sorry that we adults are such idiots. We stole away your happiness..."]
426: 6264| [47] [Kazami]
427: 6267| [45] ["Once you get out of here, live happily, enough for Nagisa too--"]
428: 6272| [45] [Once Kazami said that,]
429: 6301| [45] [they heard a thunderous roar off in the distance.]
430: 6336| [47] [Natsuhiko]
431: 6337| [45] [(!!)]
432: 6350| [45] [Roars and tremors approached through the floor.]
433: 6355| [45] [And when Natsuhiko looked to the entrance of the cargo lift room,]
434: 6360| [45] [an intense sound, force, and heat--]
435: 6365| [45] [--engulfed the three of them.]
