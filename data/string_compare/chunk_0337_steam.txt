  0:   56| [45] [--The facility was full of countless dangers, such as radiation, fire, and explosions.]
  1:   61| [47] [Jun]
  2:   62| [45] [(I hope we can regroup with Dojima and Hiyama as soon as possible.)]
  3:   67| [45] [She would feel much more at ease if they were able to rendezvous with Dojima and Hiyama, her two coworkers.]
  4:   72| [45] [But when they finally found Dojima--]
  5:  125| [45] [He was almost beyond recognition.]
  6:  130| [45] [... The tragic sight of that room had done a serious blow to Jun, Watase, and Kazami's willpower.]
  7:  190| [45] [But they were still short on AD, and time was wasting away by the second.]
  8:  195| [45] [So they overcame their comrade's death and continued the search.]
  9:  200| [45] [They managed to make their way through a gas-filled zone and turned on the sprinkler system.]
 10:  205| [45] [Jun and the others decided to take a short break in the little time they had from then until the system finished its job and the gas had ventilated...]
 11:  332| [47] [Watase]
 12:  335| [45] ["... Moribe, Teach, you guys holding up okay?"]
 13:  343| [47] [Jun]
 14:  346| [45] ["My fingertips are a bit numb... but I'm fine."]
 15:  374| [47] [Ena]
 16:  377| [45] ["I think I'll be all right after a little rest, myself."]
 17:  500| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  503| [45] ["There are no issues with me either... all that numbness in my skin went away after I took that AD."]
 19:  529| [47] [Watase]
 20:  532| [45] ["... But we can't relax."]
 21:  537| [45] [Watase glanced at his Procyon and said that.]
 22:  563| [47] [Watase]
 23:  566| [45] ["Look, it's '3090 mSv' right now... Seems like it won't be long until it passes the first danger standard of '4000 mSv'."]
 24:  594| [47] [Ena]
 25:  597| [45] ["I hope Mr. Tenkawa and the others have some AD, but...!"]
 26:  880| [47] [Watase]
 27:  883| [45] ["Teach, don't panic."]
 28:  896| [47] [Watase]
 29:  899| [45] ["The fact that we've seen empty medical boxes and AD means that there's a high chance they found some too."]
 30:  927| [47] [Ena]
 31:  930| [45] ["Hmm... you're being rather considerate."]
 32:  983| [47] [Ena]
 33:  986| [45] ["You're so nice, Captain Kasasagi."]
 34: 1014| [47] [Watase]
 35: 1017| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about? It's only natural for a rescue worker."]
 36: 1084| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 37: 1391| [47] [Jun]
 38: 1394| [45] ["That's true... I'm more worried 'bout those kids than myself right now."]
 39: 1422| [47] [Watase]
 40: 1425| [45] ["Oh yeah, that's right, you said you were acquainted with those high schoolers, right?"]
 41: 1463| [47] [Jun]
 42: 1466| [45] ["Yeah, though we only talked, like, twice or so..."]
 43: 1494| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1497| [45] ["So they're basically strangers then."]
 45: 1510| [47] [Jun]
 46: 1513| [45] ["But that doesn't mean I'm not worried about them."]
 47: 1566| [47] [Watase]
 48: 1569| [45] ["I see... that's probably because you're not that much older than they are."]
 49: 1597| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1600| [45] ["You're nice, Moribe."]
 51: 1667| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 52: 1798| [45] [--Jun's eyes widened at those words.]
 53: 1803| [47] [Jun]
 54: 1804| [45] [(She's worrying about her students first even though she's also in danger...)]
 55: 1809| [47] [Jun]
 56: 1810| [45] [(She may be harsh and too critical... but she really is a teacher, huh?)]
 57: 1815| [45] [Jun felt like she could understand Ena's heartfelt concern for Natsuhiko and her other students.]
 58: 1820| [47] [Jun]
 59: 1821| [45] [(B-but we've been fighting with each other so much... so it's kinda awkward to admit that...)]
 60: 1859| [45] [Jun struggled with her conflicting emotions, but Watase spoke up first.]
 61: 1885| [47] [Watase]
 62: 1888| [45] ["Teach, don't panic."]
 63: 1896| [47] [Watase]
 64: 1899| [45] ["The fact that we've seen empty medical boxes and AD means that there's a high chance they found some too."]
 65: 1904| [47] [Jun]
 66: 1905| [45] [(Ooh, nice support, Captain!)]
 67: 1910| [45] [Jun decided to quickly follow suit.]
 68: 1918| [47] [Jun]
 69: 1921| [45] ["H-he's right, Ms. Tsubakiyama... rushing things will only lead to more danger. Let's just rest now while we still can."]
 70: 1949| [47] [Ena]
 71: 1952| [45] ["Mmm... good point."]
 72: 1980| [47] [Kazami]
 73: 1983| [45] ["Ms. Tsubakiyama... this has all been really harsh on you, has it not?"]
 74: 2011| [47] [Ena]
 75: 2014| [45] ["To be honest, yeah, in it's own way. I've gotten tired from running around from place to place..."]
 76: 2042| [47] [Ena]
 77: 2045| [45] ["... Oh geez, why the hell did all this happen...!?"]
 78: 2073| [47] [Ena]
 79: 2076| [45] ["Everything was totally normal until yesterday, but I guess it's true when they say no one knows what the future holds..."]
 80: 2081| [45] [Ena said that in a choked voice. Jun felt sympathy welling inside her.]
 81: 2086| [47] [Jun]
 82: 2087| [45] [(All right, this is where I've gotta play it cool and act like a rescue worker.)]
 83: 2095| [47] [Jun]
 84: 2098| [45] ["C'mon Ms. Tsubakiyama, let's stop being all gloom and doom here. We'll get you and your students outta here safely, just you wait."]
 85: 2126| [47] [Ena]
 86: 2129| [45] ["Ah... I'm sorry, it looks like I let everything get to me for a second there..."]
 87: 2137| [47] [Ena]
 88: 2140| [45] ["I guess when I started thinking about the possibility that we could die in a place like this--"]
 89: 2166| [47] [Watase]
 90: 2169| [45] ["S-stop, don't jinx us all like that!"]
 91: 2197| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 2200| [45] ["You mustn't say that. Showing weakness will only double the danger."]
 93: 2208| [47] [Jun]
 94: 2211| [45] ["Got that right. I'll be damned if I let a single person die here."]
 95: 2239| [47] [Ena]
 96: 2242| [45] ["... You three sure are strong."]
 97: 2270| [47] [Ena]
 98: 2273| [45] ["... I'm sorry for having been so rude to you up until now."]
 99: 2301| [47] [Ena]
100: 2304| [45] ["You guys really are a fine rescue squad... Compared to you, all I'm good at is being all talk and no action with nothing to back it up..."]
101: 2312| [47] [Jun]
102: 2315| [45] ["Huh? Oh, uh... it's fine, don't worry about it."]
103: 2343| [47] [Ena]
104: 2346| [45] ["But... I'll try to make sure I do as you all say from now on."]
105: 2351| [45] [Ena smiled apologetically.]
106: 2356| [45] [That smile alone made Jun want to forgive her for everything she'd said up until now.]
107: 2361| [47] [Jun]
108: 2362| [45] [(... Yeah, Ms. Tsubakiyama may be a bit full of herself, but when you get down to it, she's just a "civilian"...)]
109: 2367| [47] [Jun]
110: 2368| [45] [(I can let a little selfishness slide.)]
111: 2375| [45] [Jun decided to switch to that way of thinking.]
112: 2380| [45] [She had a creed about letting the minor details go and treating those who were cooperative with kindness.]
113: 2476| [47] [Watase]
114: 2479| [45] ["Teach, don't panic."]
115: 2487| [47] [Watase]
116: 2490| [45] ["The fact that we've seen empty medical boxes and AD means that there's a high chance they found some too."]
117: 2516| [47] [Ena]
118: 2519| [45] ["Hmm... you're being rather considerate."]
119: 2545| [47] [Ena]
120: 2548| [45] ["You're so nice, Captain Kasasagi."]
121: 2553| [45] [Watase blushed at Ena's compliment.]
122: 2579| [47] [Watase]
123: 2582| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about? It's only natural for a rescue worker."]
124: 2587| [45] [Though she didn't let it slip, Jun felt let down at those words.]
125: 2592| [47] [Jun]
126: 2593| [45] [('the hell's all that "it's only natural for a rescue worker" crap? You don't even remember being a rescue worker...)]
127: 2598| [45] [She felt quite upset for some reason.]
128: 2660| [45] [Jun stared at the woman in front of her.]
129: 2665| [45] [She was a bit roughed up, but ignoring that, she was quite a beautiful woman.]
130: 2670| [47] [Jun]
131: 2671| [45] [(I hate to admit it, but she's pretty...)]
132: 2676| [47] [Jun]
133: 2677| [45] [(I'm sure someone like her could never understand my feelings.)]
134: 2760| [45] [Jun had never gone out with a man before in her life.]
135: 2765| [45] [She hadn't shown the burn scar on her back to anyone but Kazami.]
136: 2770| [47] [Jun]
137: 2771| [45] [(... No man would want to be with a girl with such a hideous scar...)]
138: 2776| [45] [There were boys who had flirted with her back in school, and Jun had fallen in love before, but her self-consciousness about her burn scar had always kept her from pursuing any actual relationships.]
139: 2781| [47] [Jun]
140: 2782| [45] [(... Great, aren't I just pathetic...)]
141: 2787| [47] [Jun]
142: 2788| [45] [(This isn't the time to be worrying about something so stupid. I'm trying to save lives here.)]
143: 2793| [47] [Jun]
144: 2794| [45] [(I've gotta stop it... If I keep getting hung up over this crap, I'll die for real...)]
145: 2801| [45] [Jun then pushed her thoughts aside.]
146: 2865| [47] [Jun]
147: 2868| [45] ["That's true... I'm more worried 'bout those kids than myself right now."]
148: 2894| [47] [Watase]
149: 2897| [45] ["Oh yeah, that's right, you said you were acquainted with those high schoolers, right?"]
150: 2905| [47] [Jun]
151: 2908| [45] ["Yeah, though we only talked, like, twice or so..."]
152: 2934| [47] [Watase]
153: 2937| [45] ["So they're basically strangers then."]
154: 2945| [47] [Jun]
155: 2948| [45] ["But that doesn't mean I'm not worried about them."]
156: 2974| [47] [Watase]
157: 2977| [45] ["I see... that's probably because you're not that much older than they are."]
158: 3003| [47] [Watase]
159: 3006| [45] ["You're nice, Moribe."]
160: 3014| [47] [Jun]
161: 3017| [45] ["Huh...?"]
162: 3025| [47] [Jun]
163: 3028| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about? It's only natural for a rescue worker."]
164: 3036| [47] [Watase]
165: 3039| [45] ["But it's still pretty impressive. You're amazing. Hell of a lot more capable than I am."]
166: 3047| [47] [Jun]
167: 3050| [45] ["Y-you think so...?"]
168: 3058| [47] [Watase]
169: 3061| [45] ["Of course. Maybe this isn't something a superior should be saying, but--"]
170: 3132| [47] [Watase]
171: 3135| [45] ["I like people like you."]
172: 3158| [47] [Jun]
173: 3161| [45] ["WHA...!?"]
174: 3169| [47] [Jun]
175: 3172| [45] ["Sorry, Captain! What'd you just say!?"]
176: 3206| [47] [Watase]
177: 3209| [45] ["Huh? Uh, I said I like people like you, that's all..."]
178: 3217| [47] [Jun]
179: 3220| [45] ["You 'light' me?"]
180: 3248| [47] [Watase]
181: 3251| [45] ["I said -like-! How many times you gonna make me say it!?"]
182: 3256| [45] [Jun's heart felt like it jumped out of her chest.]
183: 3261| [45] [She did her best to conceal that and talked back to Watase.]
184: 3269| [47] [Jun]
185: 3272| [45] ["Ha, hahah, boy, it sure is nice to see even you can make a joke every now and then."]
186: 3300| [47] [Watase]
187: 3303| [45] ["I'm not kidding. I'm totally serious."]
188: 3311| [47] [Jun]
189: 3314| [45] ["Huh...?"]
190: 3342| [47] [Watase]
191: 3345| [45] ["I'm not just talking about your personality and skills. I like your face too."]
192: 3353| [47] [Watase]
193: 3356| [45] ["Same goes for your foul mouth. And your small chest."]
194: 3364| [47] [Watase]
195: 3367| [45] ["I like everything about you, basically."]
196: 3375| [47] [Jun]
197: 3378| [45] ["Wha... what the hell are you even saying, Captain!?"]
198: 3406| [47] [Watase]
199: 3409| [45] ["Hmm? Did I say something weird?"]
200: 3437| [47] [Watase]
201: 3440| [45] ["You're cute. I'm sure I could've said that better if we weren't in this situation, though."]
202: 3448| [47] [Jun]
203: 3451| [45] ["J-just stop it, please!"]
204: 3456| [45] [Jun was getting a little scared.]
205: 3494| [45] [She looked to Kazami for help, but the lieutenant had frozen like a statue at some point during all of this.]
206: 3532| [45] [Ena was also like a statue. Yuuri was dead. Ukita had vanished.]
207: 3537| [45] [Her surroundings also looked somewhat distorted.]
208: 3575| [45] [Watase looked at Jun and spoke with a smile.]
209: 3603| [47] [Watase]
210: 3606| [45] ["Don't be scared, Jun. I guess you're not used to anyone coming on to you so bluntly, huh?"]
211: 3614| [47] [Watase]
212: 3617| [45] ["But you can't shut me out. It's useless. I can see right through you."]
213: 3645| [47] [Watase]
214: 3648| [45] ["You act so rough because you're trying to hide the complex you keep hidden beneath that skin, right?"]
215: 3656| [47] [Jun]
216: 3659| [45] ["Aah, aah..."]
217: 3687| [47] [Watase]
218: 3690| [45] ["That part of you is so cute. I want to tame you."]
219: 3718| [47] [Watase]
220: 3721| [45] ["I'll start by tearing off that uniform of yours right now--"]
221: 3779| [47] [Jun]
222: 3782| [45] ["STOP! I'm serious!"]
223: 3787| [45] [When Jun screamed that--]
224: 3792| [45] [Her distorted surroundings returned to normal.]
225: 3909| [47] [Watase]
226: 3912| [45] ["... Huh?"]
227: 3935| [47] [Jun]
228: 3938| [45] ["!?"]
229: 3943| [45] [When Jun came to her senses, everyone was staring at her dumbfoundedly.]
230: 3975| [47] [Watase]
231: 3978| [45] ["H-hey, what was that about? Why'd you just scream 'stop' like that out of nowhere?"]
232: 4006| [47] [Kazami]
233: 4009| [45] ["Did someone say anything strange?"]
234: 4017| [47] [Jun]
235: 4020| [45] ["Ah, n-no... it's nothing."]
236: 4028| [47] [Jun]
237: 4031| [45] ["Sorry, what were we talking about?"]
238: 4059| [47] [Ena]
239: 4062| [45] ["The AD, remember?"]
240: 4090| [47] [Ena]
241: 4093| [45] ["I can't believe you were spacing out when we were having such a serious discussion... You sure you're okay?"]
242: 4101| [47] [Jun]
243: 4104| [45] ["A-ahahah, sorry guys. It's nothing."]
244: 4187| [45] [Though Jun did her best to smooth things over--]
245: 4192| [45] [Her heart was pounding like a jackhammer.]
246: 4197| [47] [Jun]
247: 4198| [45] [(Wh-what the everloving hell was that...?)]
248: 4303| [47] [Jun]
249: 4304| [45] [(Was I daydreaming...? Did I start spacing out 'cause I'm so tired...?)]
250: 4309| [47] [Jun]
251: 4310| [45] [(No, there's no way the Captain would ever come on to me that way, not even in a dream...)]
252: 4315| [47] [Jun]
253: 4316| [45] [(... No way, it can't be... Was that my deepest desire...!?)]
254: 4321| [45] [Jun forced herself to switch trains of thought at that point.]
255: 4326| [47] [Jun]
256: 4327| [45] [(No, no! Hell no! Not in a million years!)]
257: 4468| [47] [Jun]
258: 4469| [45] [(I can't let myself get hung up over some messed up dream!)]
259: 4474| [47] [Jun]
260: 4475| [45] [(I'm here to save lives.)]
261: 4480| [47] [Jun]
262: 4481| [45] [(That's all I should be focusing on for now...!)]
263: 4534| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
264: 4539| [47] [Natsuhiko]
265: 4540| [45] [(Jun had that kind of complex...!?)]
266: 4545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
267: 4546| [45] [(No, this is just an altered memory. I have to adjust her feelings to give her more confidence in herself.)]
268: 4551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
269: 4552| [45] [(I think I'd better adjust her feelings for Prof. Tsubakiyama and Watase too...)]
270: 4583| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
271: 4588| [47] [Natsuhiko]
272: 4589| [45] [(... Uh... I... I've got nothing...)]
273: 4594| [47] [Natsuhiko]
274: 4595| [45] [(This whole thing's been altered so much that I'm not really sure where I should even begin repairing.)]
275: 4600| [47] [Natsuhiko]
276: 4601| [45] [(Er, if I remember correctly, what actually happened... was that Jun apologized to Watase, and then made up with Prof. Tsubakiyama--)]
277: 4606| [47] [Natsuhiko]
278: 4607| [45] [(So should I try to adjust her emotions by taking that into account...?)]
