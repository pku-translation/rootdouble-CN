  0:   53| [45] [--And then came the day of fate.]
  1:   58| [45] [September 16, 2030--]
  2:  123| [45] [Early morning that day, Yuuri went with Dr. Tenkawa to the neuroscience laboratory.]
  3:  155| [47] [Miyoko]
  4:  158| [45] ["Sorry for starting your day so early, Yuuri."]
  5:  166| [47] [Yuuri]
  6:  169| [45] ["It's okay. We're doing a very important experiment today, aren't we?"]
  7:  195| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  198| [45] ["Indeed. It'll be a long stretch from around 9 to 12, so let's give it our best."]
  9:  224| [47] [Miyoko]
 10:  227| [45] ["Before the experiment, we need to examine your brain. Please change into the testing clothes."]
 11:  260| [45] [Miyoko handed Yuuri a change of clothes.]
 12:  265| [45] [In the surrounding area, the professor's colleagues were busy preparing for the examination.]
 13:  270| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 14:  273| [45] ["Scanning preparations complete."]
 15:  278| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 16:  281| [45] ["Send me the data from the previous two rounds."]
 17:  333| [45] [None of them showed any interest in seeing Yuuri's naked body, but she still tried to find cover to change behind.]
 18:  338| [47] [Yuuri]
 19:  339| [45] [(But still... today's experiment is quite unusual, huh.)]
 20:  344| [47] [Yuuri]
 21:  345| [45] [(The professor said it's to "create a spirit"... but is that even possible?)]
 22:  350| [45] [The moment Yuuri pondered the possibility--]
 23:  370| [45] [The phone rang.]
 24:  403| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  406| [45] ["... What could that be?"]
 26:  411| [45] [Puzzled, the professor picked up the phone.]
 27:  443| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  446| [45] ["Yes. Tenkawa speaking. We're in the middle of an experiment right now, so--"]
 29:  451| [45] [Before she could finish, the professor's face froze over.]
 30:  479| [47] [Miyoko]
 31:  482| [45] ["--Natsuhiko did what?"]
 32:  490| [47] [Yuuri]
 33:  493| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 34:  504| [45] [Yuuri gasped too when she heard that name.]
 35:  528| [45] [As Yuuri strained her ears to listen, the professor continued the phone call.]
 36:  554| [47] [Miyoko]
 37:  557| [45] ["Yes, yes...!"]
 38:  583| [47] [Miyoko]
 39:  586| [45] ["... What did you say? Mashiro and Yui as well?"]
 40:  612| [47] [Miyoko]
 41:  615| [45] ["--Understood. I'll be heading over there right now."]
 42:  620| [45] [And with that, the professor hung up the phone.]
 43:  628| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  631| [45] ["U-um... what happened with Hikorin?"]
 45:  657| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  660| [45] ["I'm not sure... but it looks like those three came to LABO."]
 47:  668| [47] [Yuuri]
 48:  671| [45] ["Huh? H-how?"]
 49:  697| [47] [Miyoko]
 50:  700| [45] ["How indeed. And right as we're running an experiment..."]
 51:  708| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  711| [45] ["What in the world could he need at a time like--"]
 53:  716| [45] [Right as the professor spoke,]
 54:  764| [45] [the sound of an explosion rang out in the distance.]
 55:  778| [47] [Yuuri]
 56:  781| [45] ["!?"]
 57:  786| [45] [Yuuri was so taken by surprised that she dropped the testing clothes she was about to change into.]
 58:  794| [47] [Miyoko]
 59:  797| [45] ["Wh-what was that sound!?"]
 60:  802| [45] [As if to answer that question, more and more sounds echoed forth.]
 61:  901| [45] [The automatic disaster prevention system broadcast an automated message.]
 62:  906| [47] [Automatic PA]
 63:  909| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B1 Area 1."]
 64:  914| [47] [Automatic PA]
 65:  917| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 3."]
 66:  922| [47] [Automatic PA]
 67:  925| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 68:  930| [47] [Automatic PA]
 69:  933| [45] ["--Intense tremors detected in B2 Area 2."]
 70:  938| [47] [Automatic PA]
 71:  941| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 72:  946| [45] [Yuuri didn't really understand what was going on.]
 73:  969| [45] [But she did know that something terrible was befalling the facility.]
 74:  977| [47] [Yuuri]
 75:  980| [45] ["P... Professor..."]
 76:  987| [45] [Yuuri became frightened and walked up to her.]
 77: 1020| [45] [The professor wrapped Yuuri in a protective embrace just as a clamorous broadcast echoed through the halls.]
 78: 1028| [47] [Announcer]
 79: 1031| [45] ["Th-this is an emergency broadcast!"]
 80: 1039| [47] [Announcer]
 81: 1042| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have just occurred within the facility!"]
 82: 1050| [47] [Announcer]
 83: 1053| [45] ["From our current understanding of the situation, explosions occurred simultaneously in ten different locations inside the facility. Fires have broken out as a result!"]
 84: 1064| [45] [That broadcast sent all the researchers panicking.]
 85: 1069| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 86: 1072| [45] ["Explosions in ten different locations...!?"]
 87: 1077| [47] [Staff Member 2]
 88: 1080| [45] ["'Unknown origin'!? What do you mean, 'unknown origin'!?"]
 89: 1103| [47] [Yuuri]
 90: 1106| [45] ["...!"]
 91: 1111| [45] [The frightened Yuuri clung to the professor.]
 92: 1116| [45] [The professor embraced her shoulders back and spoke.]
 93: 1142| [47] [Miyoko]
 94: 1145| [45] ["It's okay...! This facility's equipped with layers upon layers of disaster prevention systems."]
 95: 1153| [47] [Miyoko]
 96: 1156| [45] ["No matter what happens, it shouldn't escalate to a large-scale disaster."]
 97: 1182| [47] [Miyoko]
 98: 1185| [45] ["Our safety is guaranteed... so there's no need to worry."]
 99: 1190| [45] [She spoke in a voice calm to the core. As if she were trying to encourage Yuuri.]
100: 1198| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1201| [45] ["B-but why did this happen--"]
102: 1227| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1230| [45] ["Why indeed. There's no reason for an explosion to have occurred in this facility..."]
104: 1256| [47] [Miyoko]
105: 1259| [45] ["..."]
106: 1285| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 1288| [45] ["... It couldn't be. Terrorism!?"]
108: 1296| [47] [Yuuri]
109: 1299| [45] ["T-terrorism!?"]
110: 1307| [47] [Miyoko]
111: 1310| [45] ["An anti-BC extremist group has been conducting acts of destruction within the city recently."]
112: 1318| [47] [Miyoko]
113: 1321| [45] ["Yesterday, they blew up the PRC and that was thought to have been the end of their string of crimes... but could it be that their actual target was here!?"]
114: 1347| [47] [Miyoko]
115: 1350| [45] ["How did they find out this place was a BC research facility!?"]
116: 1358| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1361| [45] ["W-was there an information leak somewhere!?"]
118: 1387| [47] [Miyoko]
119: 1390| [45] ["I don't know! The same goes for what their goal is..."]
120: 1416| [47] [Miyoko]
121: 1419| [45] ["But it's too dangerous for us to stay here. That's for certain!"]
122: 1427| [47] [Miyoko]
123: 1430| [45] ["Yuuri, let's evacuate to somewhere safe!"]
124: 1438| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1441| [45] ["O-okay!"]
126: 1474| [45] [The professor took Yuuri by the hand and left the laboratory.]
127: 1532| [45] [--They ran up the emergency staircase and headed to B1 Area 5.]
128: 1540| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1543| [45] ["Professor, where are we going!?"]
130: 1571| [47] [Miyoko]
131: 1574| [45] ["There's an emergency shelter here in Area 5."]
132: 1600| [47] [Miyoko]
133: 1603| [45] ["In truth, Area Zero is the safest place, but going there requires tedious formalities..."]
134: 1637| [45] [The professor stopped and looked at the wall.]
135: 1685| [45] [There was a numeric keypad affixed to it.]
136: 1699| [47] [Miyoko]
137: 1702| [45] ["107215... Okay, it opened!"]
138: 1713| [45] [The professor entered what appeared to be a password and the wall slid open, revealing a narrow passageway.]
139: 1764| [45] [They rushed up to a steel door deep inside and opened it.]
140: 1850| [47] [Miyoko]
141: 1853| [45] ["Yuuri, I'm sorry, but hide yourself here!"]
142: 1861| [47] [Miyoko]
143: 1864| [45] ["This place was designed to withstand minor explosions and fires! It's perfectly safe!"]
144: 1872| [47] [Yuuri]
145: 1875| [45] ["A-All right!"]
146: 1901| [47] [Miyoko]
147: 1904| [45] ["I'll go investigate what's happening! And there's the issue with Natsuhiko too, so--"]
148: 1912| [47] [Miyoko]
149: 1915| [45] ["Understand? Wait for me here, okay!?"]
150: 1923| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 1926| [45] ["Understood. Be careful!"]
152: 1966| [45] [The professor nodded and left the shelter.]
153: 1977| [45] [--Yuuri was left there alone.]
154: 1982| [45] [The sound of explosions kept going on and on.]
155: 1987| [47] [Yuuri]
156: 1988| [45] [(Hikorin's here...? Why would he come now of all times...!?)]
157: 1993| [45] [Yuuri was worried about them, but she couldn't just leave the shelter.]
158: 1998| [47] [Yuuri]
159: 1999| [45] [(If I could at least confirm their safety...)]
160: 2004| [45] [As Yuuri pondered about how to do that-- it hit her.]
161: 2009| [47] [Yuuri]
162: 2010| [45] [(I know! I'll use BC!)]
163: 2017| [45] [She could confirm Natsuhiko's current situation using Senses Sympathy.]
164: 2022| [45] [Furthermore, since the facility was now in Evacuation Mode, the BC-insulated security gates were all wide open.]
165: 2027| [45] [Meaning she would in theory be able to use BC on him even if he was in a faraway area.]
166: 2091| [45] [Yuuri focused her mind-- and tried using Senses Sympathy on Natsuhiko.]
167: 2267| [45] [But the moment her senses sympathized with Natsuhiko's, an intense headache struck.]
168: 2275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2278| [45] ["Khh!"]
170: 2283| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2284| [45] [(!)]
172: 2289| [45] [The pain Natsuhiko felt propagated to Yuuri.]
173: 2294| [45] [The girls beside him looked at him in concern.]
174: 2320| [47] [Salyu]
175: 2323| [45] ["Natsuhiko, do you have a headache again!?"]
176: 2331| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2334| [45] ["Gh... guh, uuuuuuggh...!"]
178: 2360| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 2363| [45] ["Are you okay, Natsuhiko!? Hang in there!"]
180: 2397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
181: 2400| [45] ["..."]
182: 2405| [47] [Yuuri]
183: 2406| [45] [(Th-this headache...!)]
184: 2411| [45] [Yuuri knew the truth behind that headache.]
185: 2416| [45] [It was the headache Natsuhiko would always get when his mind was on the verge of collapse--!]
186: 2482| [45] [The moment that thought crossed his mind, he heard another explosion from nearby.]
187: 2487| [47] [Yuuri]
188: 2488| [45] [(!?)]
189: 2580| [45] [Natsuhiko promptly covered for Mashiro and Yui.]
190: 2667| [45] [One second later, a blazing wind shot by, and the kids were blown away.]
191: 2801| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2804| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
193: 2812| [47] [Natsuhiko]
194: 2815| [45] ["A-are you two okay!?"]
195: 2820| [45] [They slowly got up after having fallen on top of each other.]
196: 2854| [47] [Salyu]
197: 2857| [45] ["... Y... yeah..."]
198: 2891| [47] [Mashiro]
199: 2894| [45] ["I-I'm okay...!"]
200: 2899| [45] [The two groaned, but they appeared to be uninjured.]
201: 2904| [47] [Yuuri]
202: 2905| [45] [(Thank goodness...!)]
203: 2959| [45] [Yuuri felt relieved as the three kids ran around, searching for an exit.]
204: 3013| [45] [She didn't understand what their objective was.]
205: 3018| [45] [But Yuuri had a lone desire.]
206: 3023| [47] [Yuuri]
207: 3024| [45] [(I need to get those three out of here as soon as possible...!)]
208: 3088| [45] [Yuuri focused further and sent Natsuhiko telepathy.]
209: 3177| [45] [--Intense telepathy that worked not only to cause an auditory hallucination, but a visual one as well--!]
210: 3395| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3398| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
212: 3406| [47] [Natsuhiko]
213: 3409| [45] ["--Yuuri!?"]
214: 3414| [45] [Natsuhiko stopped in his tracks, speechless.]
215: 3419| [45] [His eyes were no doubt "seeing" Yuuri.]
216: 3446| [47] [Yuuri]
217: 3449| [45] [{... Hikorin...}]
218: 3457| [47] [Yuuri]
219: 3460| [45] [{Why did you come here...!?}]
220: 3468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
221: 3471| [45] ["What about you, Yuuri!? Why are -you- here!?"]
222: 3479| [47] [Natsuhiko]
223: 3482| [45] ["You left home!?"]
224: 3487| [45] [Yuuri was holding a conversation with him without issue. Though she was relieved, she had other thoughts on her mind as well.]
225: 3492| [47] [Yuuri]
226: 3493| [45] [(First I need to find the reason Hikorin came to LABO-- and with that information, I need to think of a way to get him to leave!)]
227: 3596| [45] [Yuuri immediately peered into Natsuhiko's memory.]
228: 3936| [45] [She looked through his memories of what he experienced the previous few days.]
229: 4274| [45] [How he came across a traffic accident. How he met Salyu.]
230: 4613| [45] [How he heard about the terrorists from Mashiro, and how they came to LABO to stop them--]
231: 4990| [45] [--but were one step behind and the terrorist attack proceeded.]
232: 4995| [45] [The watch that broke and stopped at that time left a severe impression.]
233: 5116| [45] [--Once she had caught all of the details, Yuuri murmured in admiration and surprise.]
234: 5124| [47] [Yuuri]
235: 5127| [45] ["So that's what happened..."]
236: 5132| [45] [Those words were heard by Natsuhiko as well via BC.]
237: 5179| [47] [Yuuri]
238: 5180| [45] [(What do I do...!?)]
239: 5185| [45] [Now that she had understood the situation, Yuuri was at a loss for how to proceed.]
240: 5190| [45] [The first thing on the agenda would probably be to get them out safely.]
241: 5195| [45] [But there was something else that was equally important.]
242: 5200| [47] [Yuuri]
243: 5201| [45] [(Hikorin's trying to regain his memories!)]
244: 5206| [45] [Natsuhiko had been tormented by his frequently chaotic memory for some time.]
245: 5211| [45] [He still lacked any of the "preparedness to know the truth" that the professor had talked about.]
246: 5216| [45] [But if he were to fall victim to his panic disorder or stupefaction in this situation, it would mean certain death.]
247: 5221| [45] [After all, he'd nearly gotten caught in an explosive blast mere moments ago.]
248: 5226| [47] [Yuuri]
249: 5227| [45] [(If something were to happen to him, then even Mashiron and Yui could get caught up in it...!)]
250: 5331| [45] [And even if the three of them did escape, Natsuhiko would eventually regain his memory of nine years ago regardless.]
251: 5336| [45] [And then his mind would collapse yet again.]
252: 5341| [45] [In light of the impending crisis-- there was only one path for Yuuri to take.]
253: 5346| [47] [Yuuri]
254: 5347| [45] [(In that case, I'll start now...)]
255: 5352| [47] [Yuuri]
256: 5353| [45] [(And manipulate Hikorin's memory to give him the strength he needs to handle the truth...!)]
257: 5358| [45] [She didn't know how much time was left.]
258: 5363| [45] [But it was something that needed to be done while she guided them down an escape route.]
259: 5368| [45] [It was the only way.]
260: 5422| [47] [Yuuri]
261: 5423| [45] [(Hikorin has so many people there to support him now.)]
262: 5489| [47] [Yuuri]
263: 5490| [45] [(As long as Mashiron and Yui are there for him, I'm sure Hikorin can handle the truth!)]
264: 5495| [45] [To get him to accept the truth and free him from her curse--]
265: 5587| [47] [Yuuri]
266: 5590| [45] ["I'll rewind time for Hikorin, as many times as it takes...!"]
