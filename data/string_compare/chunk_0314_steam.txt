  0:   64| [45] [--After that night where Ukita learned the truth about LABO--]
  1:   69| [45] [He began his lonely battle.]
  2:   98| [45] [He worked all alone in his personal office.]
  3:  103| [45] [The only work he did was the mind-numbing process of examining data sent to him. A fitting job for someone who had been kicked upstairs.]
  4:  108| [45] [There was a surveillance camera in his office, so he would've been found out immediately if he ever showed the slightest sign of doing anything suspicious.]
  5:  113| [45] [--But they couldn't read his mind.]
  6:  118| [45] [Ukita was thinking over his next course of action as he did his job.]
  7:  123| [47] [Ukita]
  8:  124| [45] [(What should I do...? How can I stop the human experimentation?)]
  9:  129| [47] [Ukita]
 10:  130| [45] [(The Rokumei City government must be in cahoots with LABO if they're keeping up such a large-scale cover-up. So that means going to the police is out of the question.)]
 11:  135| [47] [Ukita]
 12:  136| [45] [(And leaking word out to the media... will be difficult as well.)]
 13:  141| [45] [LABO performed a strict body search on anyone entering or leaving the facility, so it'd be extremely hard to smuggle out damning documents.]
 14:  146| [45] [And what's more, Ukita still didn't know anything more than the basic details about the test subject.]
 15:  151| [45] [One wrong step and he'd most likely meet the same fate that Senior Fellow S had.]
 16:  156| [47] [Ukita]
 17:  157| [45] [(... Then that means the only reliable groups are...)]
 18:  262| [45] [When that thought hit him, Ukita began participating in various internet forums to find organizations who looked like they'd help his cause.]
 19:  267| [45] [He then posted a question to the users on those forums.]
 20:  272| [45] ["Do you think you could forgive Rokumei City if it turned out they were secretly using Communicators for human experimentation?"]
 21:  277| [45] [But their responses only served to betray Ukita's hopes each time.]
 22:  282| [45] [Their comments of "think you're getting a tad delusional there" and "lol conspiracy theorists" showed that not only did they not believe him at all, but they also didn't have any sense of impending danger.]
 23:  287| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  288| [45] [(Dammit, what should I do? The test subject could be suffering even at this moment! So how...!)]
 25:  295| [45] [--Just then...]
 26:  312| [45] [Ukita's PDA rang with a faint beep.]
 27:  317| [45] [He took it out and looked at the display to find it read "Caller Unknown".]
 28:  328| [45] [Though it made him feel vaguely anxious, he still picked up the phone.]
 29:  336| [47] [Ukita]
 30:  339| [45] ["... Hello?"]
 31:  344| [47] [???]
 32:  347| [45] ["Speaker U, I presume?"]
 33:  370| [47] [Ukita]
 34:  373| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 35:  381| [47] [Ukita]
 36:  384| [45] ["Wh-who are you!? No, first things first, how do you know who I am!?"]
 37:  389| [45] [Ukita had taken special precautions every time he participated in a forum discussion to keep his identity from being leaked.]
 38:  394| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  395| [45] [(But someone's actually calling me! That means--!?)]
 40:  400| [45] [Just then, the voice on the other end spoke gently as if he'd anticipated Ukita would panic.]
 41:  405| [47] [???]
 42:  408| [45] ["Wait, hold on. I'd like to hear your story before you hear mine."]
 43:  416| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  419| [45] ["My story...?"]
 45:  424| [47] [???]
 46:  427| [45] ["I am quite interested in the things you've been writing. I'd like to have a more in-depth discussion about them--"]
 47:  432| [47] [???]
 48:  435| [45] ["However, our talk will get a tad complicated. Could we perhaps move this discussion somewhere else?"]
 49:  443| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  446| [45] ["Do you mean... you want to meet me face-to-face?"]
 51:  451| [47] [???]
 52:  454| [45] ["Something like that. So come to the location I am about to give you. Alone."]
 53:  459| [47] [???]
 54:  462| [45] ["You're free to refuse, of course."]
 55:  469| [45] [For some odd reason, Ukita couldn't defy that voice.]
 56:  536| [45] [--The address he was given was the old Rokumei City Hospital that had burned down in the "Great Rokumei City Arson" 14 years ago.]
 57:  541| [47] [Ukita]
 58:  542| [45] [(If this is a trap by LABO... then I might be erased.)]
 59:  554| [45] [He kept up his guard when he walked into the ruins, but there were no signs of anyone else there.]
 60:  562| [47] [Ukita]
 61:  565| [45] ["Hey! Is someone there!?"]
 62:  570| [45] [Ukita's shouts echoed ineffectually through the ruins.]
 63:  576| [45] [Ukita became convinced that it might've been a trap and was about to run for it--]
 64:  581| [45] [--when he spotted a shining object in a corner on the floor.]
 65:  589| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  592| [45] ["What's that...?"]
 67:  605| [45] [He walked over to the object and picked it up. It was a PDA.]
 68:  610| [45] [The words "Call in progress" were displayed on its screen.]
 69:  617| [45] [Ukita timidly pressed it to his ear... and then heard the voice of the man who had called him earlier.]
 70:  628| [47] [???]
 71:  631| [45] ["Good. Looks like you really did come."]
 72:  639| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  642| [45] ["... What's the meaning of this? Don't tell me that you don't plan on showing your own face after you called me out here?"]
 74:  647| [47] [???]
 75:  650| [45] ["I truly am sorry, but I cannot meet with you face-to-face. It would be impossible for me to enter Rokumei City due to my social status."]
 76:  655| [47] [???]
 77:  658| [45] ["So I prepared this PDA and had a friend of mine deliver it to that location."]
 78:  666| [47] [Ukita]
 79:  669| [45] ["What? Why would you choose such a roundabout method to contact me...?"]
 80:  677| [47] [Ukita]
 81:  680| [45] ["Wouldn't it have been better to just keep talking on the phone if you never intended to meet me face-to-face anyway?"]
 82:  685| [47] [???]
 83:  688| [45] ["Oh my, then you don't know? All the phones in Rokumei City--"]
 84:  693| [47] [???]
 85:  696| [45] ["--are tapped."]
 86:  719| [47] [Ukita]
 87:  722| [45] ["Wha!?"]
 88:  727| [45] [Ukita gasped.]
 89:  732| [45] [Though he had indeed heard rumors to that effect, he simply dismissed them as a rather sick joke--]
 90:  737| [47] [???]
 91:  740| [45] ["Rokumei City has created a voice analysis system that analyzes the vast amount of voice data exchanged over all phone calls in the city."]
 92:  745| [47] [???]
 93:  748| [45] ["Should anyone say anything of inconvenience over the phone, it will automatically be intercepted and reported to the security department."]
 94:  753| [47] [???]
 95:  756| [45] ["Something like this, for example-- 'can you all forgive Rokumei City?'."]
 96:  764| [47] [Ukita]
 97:  767| [45] ["Th-then does that mean this conversation's being monitored too...?"]
 98:  772| [47] [???]
 99:  775| [45] ["No, this PDA is a direct call digital transceiver that doesn't go through any relay stations."]
100:  780| [47] [???]
101:  783| [45] ["The call's also encrypted, so we don't have to worry about unwanted ears listening in."]
102:  791| [47] [Ukita]
103:  794| [45] ["..."]
104:  799| [45] [Ukita felt his spine grow cold as they talked.]
105:  804| [45] [He was of course shocked about the tapping, but he also felt spooked out at just how throughly prepared the caller had been.]
106:  809| [47] [???]
107:  812| [45] ["Anyway, relax. We can talk all we want with this PDA."]
108:  820| [47] [Ukita]
109:  823| [45] ["W-wait a moment. Before we get into that... let me ask you something."]
110:  831| [47] [Ukita]
111:  834| [45] ["Who in the world are you?"]
112:  839| [47] [???]
113:  842| [45] ["Me, huh. I'm--"]
114:  847| [45] [The man paused before he answered Ukita's question.]
115:  852| [47] [???]
116:  855| [45] ["If I said 'Q', would you know what I meant?"]
117:  863| [47] [Ukita]
118:  866| [45] ["Q!? That terrorist group that hates Communicators!?"]
119:  871| [47] [Q]
120:  874| [45] ["No. We are not terrorists."]
121:  879| [47] [Q]
122:  882| [45] ["I plan to tell you the whole story about that-- but I'd like to propose something to you first."]
123:  887| [47] [Q]
124:  890| [45] ["As I'm sure you've already realized, you are trying to take on an enemy that is too big for you fight alone."]
125:  895| [47] [Q]
126:  898| [45] ["So what do you say about using us to achieve your goal?"]
127:  906| [47] [Ukita]
128:  909| [45] ["D-don't be absurd! My goal is to save the Communicators imprisoned in LABO!"]
129:  917| [47] [Ukita]
130:  920| [45] ["I could never accept help from people who hate Communicators like--"]
131:  925| [47] [Q]
132:  928| [45] ["No. It is not Communicators that we hate."]
133:  936| [47] [Ukita]
134:  939| [45] ["Huh? What was that...?"]
135:  944| [47] [Q]
136:  947| [45] ["We are indeed not fond of Communicators. But what we hate above all else is the Rokumei City government."]
137:  955| [47] [Ukita]
138:  958| [45] ["Why them?"]
139:  963| [47] [Q]
140:  966| [45] ["Q was once not a terrorist organization. We were a simple citizen group with good intentions."]
141:  971| [47] [Q]
142:  974| [45] ["We pleaded our case to the world: 'it is only a natural right to not want others reading your mind'."]
143:  979| [47] [Q]
144:  982| [45] ["But that didn't go by so well. We caught the eye of the Rokumei City government, who then had us framed as a terrorist organization."]
145: 1033| [45] [--The man then told Ukita about the trigger that turned Q into a terrorist group.]
146: 1038| [45] [About how a Communicator called "A" caused the Great Rokumei City Arson 14 years ago on September 16, 2014.]
147: 1043| [45] [About how in spite of that, the Rokumei City government had covered up the facts and blamed the entire incident on Q.]
148: 1048| [45] [About how A had been confined in LABO after that-- and then passed away a year later.]
149: 1053| [45] [Hearing that story finally gave Ukita the information he needed to connect all the dots together.]
150: 1058| [47] [Ukita]
151: 1059| [45] [(I see... so that's why LABO has been confining Communicators with immense power like A's under the facility...!)]
152: 1064| [45] [LABO's research probably benefited tremendously from taking Communicators as powerful as A and using them as test subjects.]
153: 1069| [45] [That was how they'd been able to produce so many results up until that point.]
154: 1111| [47] [Ukita]
155: 1114| [45] ["... So what you're saying is that the true culprits of the Great Rokumei City Arson are Communicator A and the 15 men and women she infected with her malice, correct...?"]
156: 1119| [47] [Q]
157: 1122| [45] ["Yes. And those 15 people had nothing to do with us. They were just normal citizens in the wrong place at the wrong time."]
158: 1127| [47] [Q]
159: 1130| [45] ["The Rokumei City government covered up the truth behind the incident. However, that simply turned the whole thing into an incoherent mess."]
160: 1135| [47] [Q]
161: 1138| [45] ["No one would ever believe an absurd story that 15 unrelated men and women just happened to all commit arson on the same night."]
162: 1143| [47] [Q]
163: 1146| [45] ["So to fill in the inconsistencies, the Rokumei City government decided to use our group as a scapegoat."]
164: 1151| [47] [Q]
165: 1154| [45] ["We were branded as extremists who hated Communicators so much that we set fire to the city--"]
166: 1159| [47] [Q]
167: 1162| [45] ["Thereby lumping us in with the 15 true culprits of the Great Arson and receiving the same blame they did."]
168: 1167| [47] [Q]
169: 1170| [45] ["We were then sentenced to jail. By the time we were released, our group was no more.%NThe former members had all dispersed."]
170: 1175| [47] [Q]
171: 1178| [45] ["We pleaded our innocence afterwards, but none believed us. It seemed as if our voices would fade away for good... but we didn't give up."]
172: 1183| [47] [Q]
173: 1186| [45] ["We gathered up our scattered members a few years later and rebuilt the organization into its current form."]
174: 1191| [47] [Q]
175: 1194| [45] ["We felt that if Rokumei City called us a terrorist organization, then we should turn that lie into the truth."]
176: 1199| [47] [Q]
177: 1202| [45] ["We will do whatever is necessary to achieve that...! Even if it means taking up arms!"]
178: 1210| [47] [Ukita]
179: 1213| [45] ["Why are you doing all this? To prove your innocence?"]
180: 1218| [47] [Q]
181: 1221| [45] ["That's not all. Far from it. We have chosen this path to protect society."]
182: 1229| [47] [Ukita]
183: 1232| [45] ["To protect... society?"]
184: 1237| [47] [Q]
185: 1240| [45] ["... The thing we've all taken home from the Great Rokumei City Arson is that BC is an extremely dangerous power."]
186: 1245| [47] [Q]
187: 1248| [45] ["A power that is very high-risk in human hands by its very nature."]
188: 1271| [47] [Ukita]
189: 1274| [45] ["...!"]
190: 1279| [45] [Ukita gasped.]
191: 1284| [45] [In what was perhaps the epitome of irony, those words mirrored the ones he once heard from the woman he had respected.]
192: 1289| [47] [Q]
193: 1292| [45] ["You understand as well that BC is something that the world would have been far safer being ignorant of, don't you?"]
194: 1300| [47] [Ukita]
195: 1303| [45] ["Y-yes..."]
196: 1308| [47] [Q]
197: 1311| [45] ["But they keep its true self hidden away from public knowledge and only emphasize the good parts of it."]
198: 1316| [47] [Q]
199: 1319| [45] ["Even if problems do arise, they'll either deal with it behind closed doors, cover it up, or announce it to the public in a false, sugarcoated form."]
200: 1324| [47] [Q]
201: 1327| [45] ["-That- is what we truly cannot forgive...!"]
202: 1332| [47] [Q]
203: 1335| [45] ["A small percentage of people influence society's trends, make a mockery of the sanctity of individuality, and show no remorse for their deeds."]
204: 1340| [47] [Q]
205: 1343| [45] ["If that is decreed to be the natural order of things, the way that society is structured--"]
206: 1348| [47] [Q]
207: 1351| [45] ["Then don't we have to object to it even if it means separating from that structure?"]
208: 1356| [47] [Q]
209: 1359| [45] ["Don't we have to pose the unrelenting questions to this insidious world, through our own actions!?"]
210: 1364| [45] [Every word the man spoke hit Ukita to the core.]
211: 1369| [45] [For he had been thinking the exact same things ever since he discovered the existence of the test subject.]
212: 1374| [47] [Q]
213: 1377| [45] ["... I'll ask you one more time. What do you want to do?"]
214: 1382| [47] [Q]
215: 1385| [45] ["Tell me what it is you feel you must do."]
216: 1390| [45] [Ukita answered the question in a clear voice.]
217: 1398| [47] [Ukita]
218: 1401| [45] ["I... want to save them."]
219: 1409| [47] [Ukita]
220: 1412| [45] ["I want to save whoever LABO's imprisoned as a test subject, no matter what it takes."]
221: 1420| [47] [Ukita]
222: 1423| [45] ["I simply cannot allow them to continue that barbaric research...!"]
223: 1428| [45] [Those words came straight from the bottom of his heart.]
224: 1433| [45] [The man from Q appeared to have expected that answer.]
225: 1438| [47] [Q]
226: 1441| [45] ["... That's right. Meanwhile, we wish to expose LABO and Rokumei City's treachery."]
227: 1446| [47] [Q]
228: 1449| [45] ["So how about it? Doesn't it sound like we share a common interest?"]
229: 1457| [47] [Ukita]
230: 1460| [45] ["Well, that may be true, but..."]
231: 1465| [47] [Q]
232: 1468| [45] ["We are your tools. We will prepare everything you'll need."]
233: 1473| [47] [Q]
234: 1476| [45] ["The rest depends on if you have the will to act-- that's all."]
235: 1481| [45] [He -did- have that will.]
236: 1489| [47] [Ukita]
237: 1492| [45] ["Very well. I'll accept your offer."]
238: 1500| [47] [Ukita]
239: 1503| [45] ["However, promise me one thing. Swear you won't harm any test subjects that get rescued."]
240: 1508| [47] [Q]
241: 1511| [45] ["You have my word. Our goal is to return to a world where we can advocate our natural rights."]
242: 1516| [45] [And thus Ukita decided to join Q.]
243: 1569| [45] [--He then spent his days after that secretly working in LABO to gain the information he'd need for the plan.]
244: 1574| [45] [He'd occasionally hack a Senior Fellow's computer.]
245: 1579| [45] [It was a very risky move, but he always took the utmost of caution, and in time, he gathered more and more information.]
246: 1638| [47] [Ukita]
247: 1639| [45] [(... According to this document, there's definitely more than one test subject...!)]
248: 1644| [47] [Ukita]
249: 1645| [45] [(They're children named Subject N, Subject Y, and Subject Y-II.)]
250: 1650| [47] [Ukita]
251: 1651| [45] [(If one of them was born in LABO, that means they must have abducted the other ones...)]
252: 1662| [47] [Ukita]
253: 1663| [45] [(But it says here that one of them has already been "discarded"... So that means they died...!?)]
254: 1668| [47] [Ukita]
255: 1669| [45] [(They'll pay for this... I swear I'll save the other two test subjects...!)]
256: 1722| [47] [Ukita]
257: 1723| [45] [("Case N"... it appears that this is the code used to prevent a test subject from escaping.)]
258: 1728| [47] [Ukita]
259: 1729| [45] [(Its specifications were revised to be stricter after 2021, huh... How are we going to get past this?)]
260: 1782| [47] [Ukita]
261: 1783| [45] [(This is it... If we can exploit this hole in the disaster prevention system...!)]
262: 1788| [47] [Ukita]
263: 1789| [45] [(But it's not something I can do alone--...)]
264: 1840| [45] [--As he quickly gathered more and more information, the structure of the plan began to form in Ukita's mind.]
265: 1845| [45] [After about a year or so had passed, he reported his life-endangering plan to Q.]
266: 1898| [47] [Ukita]
267: 1901| [45] ["--In summary, the plan is to cause a man-made accident inside of LABO and seize that opportunity to save the test subjects."]
268: 1906| [47] [Q]
269: 1909| [45] ["Incredible! It sounds like it'll be enough to overcome LABO's strict security."]
270: 1917| [47] [Ukita]
271: 1920| [45] ["But I do not believe I can accomplish this all by myself. It's essential that we get help from a firefighter or someone."]
272: 1925| [47] [Q]
273: 1928| [45] ["Understood. Then leave the recruitment of our new comrade to us."]
274: 1936| [47] [Ukita]
275: 1939| [45] ["No, all you have to do is pick out people who look like plausible candidates. I'd like to select my own collaborators."]
276: 1944| [47] [Q]
277: 1947| [45] ["... Does that mean you still don't fully trust us?"]
278: 1955| [47] [Ukita]
279: 1958| [45] ["Isn't that only natural? I don't even know your face and name."]
280: 1963| [47] [Q]
281: 1966| [45] ["Fair point... Very well. Then start your investigation into the matter right away."]
282: 1971| [47] [Q]
283: 1974| [45] ["I don't think I have to remind you, but be careful about your calls being tapped when you're recruiting our potential comrade."]
284: 1979| [47] [Q]
285: 1982| [45] ["I'll prepare another digital transceiver for you. Use it."]
286: 1987| [45] [Ukita did exactly what he said on that front.]
287: 2040| [45] [Then one evening a week later.]
288: 2045| [45] [Ukita got home from work to find a PDA in his mailbox.]
289: 2050| [45] [It had to be the digital transceiver meant for the call.]
290: 2061| [45] [He checked the data folder to find a file labeled "comrade candidates".]
291: 2066| [47] [Ukita]
292: 2067| [45] [(Hmm... Captain Watase Kasasagi of the special elite rescue squad "Sirius", huh...)]
293: 2072| [45] [The file contained information beginning with basics like his address and phone number to extensive details such as his personal history.]
294: 2077| [45] [Surprisingly enough, it even contained key points to be used in persuading him.]
295: 2085| [47] [Ukita]
296: 2088| [45] ["But... how did they obtain all this information...?"]
297: 2094| [47] [Ukita]
298: 2095| [45] [(Just who in the world is that man who calls himself part of "Q"?)]
299: 2100| [45] [Judging from his attitude, he most likely was telling the truth about being a member.]
300: 2105| [45] [But Ukita had grown uneasy about how the man always seemed to know exactly what he was thinking.]
301: 2110| [47] [Ukita]
302: 2111| [45] [(I feel I can rely on him now, but I don't think he's someone I'd ever open my heart to...)]
303: 2116| [45] [That was exactly why Ukita had wanted to pick the person he'd truly call his comrade on his own.]
304: 2127| [45] [Ukita took a deep breath, then took the PDA and dialed Watase's number.]
305: 2157| [47] [Ukita]
306: 2160| [45] ["Mr. Watase Kasasagi, I presume?"]
307: 2168| [47] [Watase]
308: 2171| [45] ["Umm... who is this?"]
309: 2179| [47] [Ukita]
310: 2182| [45] ["I'm not one to give away my name. The truth is, there is something I'd like to tell you."]
311: 2187| [45] [Ukita then began talking in a quiet voice, following the information Q had prepared for him.]
312: 2192| [45] [The words he'd need to recruit his comrade...]
