  0:    8| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 2]
  1:   15| [47] [Watase]
  2:   18| [45] ["Wh-what's that noise!?"]
  3:   51| [47] [Kazami]
  4:   54| [45] ["Oh, that's my watch alarm. I set it to go off when our last dosage of AD wears off."]
  5:   59| [45] [Taken aback, Watase checked his watch.]
  6:   64| [45] [The digital reading said "10:16 AM" on it.]
  7:   72| [47] [Kazami]
  8:   75| [45] ["I know there are some of you here who took their last AD less than an hour ago, but we should all inject ourselves now just to be safe."]
  9:  101| [47] [Ukita]
 10:  104| [45] ["I-I see... then let's put this discussion aside for now and administer it to everyone."]
 11:  130| [47] [Jun]
 12:  133| [45] ["Yeah... these are our lives that are at stake here, after all."]
 13:  216| [45] [Jun seemed to have come back to her senses, as she quickly distributed AD to Ena, Ukita, and Yuuri.]
 14:  221| [45] [Ena and Ukita injected themselves immediately.]
 15:  254| [47] [Ena]
 16:  257| [45] ["... This'll keep us up and running for another hour, huh?"]
 17:  284| [47] [Ukita]
 18:  287| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 19:  292| [45] [Ena and Ukita muttered that.]
 20:  368| [45] [But-- Yuuri and Yuuri alone still hadn't injected herself for some reason.]
 21:  395| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  398| [45] ["Ms. Yuuri, what's wrong?"]
 23:  424| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  427| [45] ["No... I-I don't want to inject it..."]
 25:  453| [47] [Kazami]
 26:  456| [45] ["You're still saying things like that!?"]
 27:  464| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  467| [45] ["Very well. Then I'll do it."]
 29:  493| [47] [Yuuri]
 30:  496| [45] ["N-no..."]
 31:  522| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  525| [45] ["You can't be stubborn!"]
 33:  558| [47] [Yuuri]
 34:  561| [45] ["Ah..."]
 35:  566| [45] [Just like last time, Kazami injected Yuuri with AD without hearing the latter out.]
 36:  624| [45] [--But there were now only two AD left.]
 37:  629| [45] [Watase, Kazami, and Jun exchanged glances.]
 38:  655| [47] [Jun]
 39:  658| [45] ["Dammit, now we're too short...!"]
 40:  666| [47] [Watase]
 41:  669| [45] ["... What should we do?"]
 42:  696| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  699| [45] ["'What should we do'? That's already been decided."]
 44:  707| [47] [Kazami]
 45:  710| [45] ["Captain, Moribe, please administer it to yourselves."]
 46:  736| [47] [Watase]
 47:  739| [45] ["Wh-why us!?"]
 48:  747| [47] [Kazami]
 49:  750| [45] ["Your body still isn't in perfect shape, so there's no way I can allow you to push yourself."]
 50:  776| [47] [Kazami]
 51:  779| [45] ["And Moribe has the smallest body amongst us. So we should assume her resistance to radiation is weak."]
 52:  805| [47] [Jun]
 53:  808| [45] ["B-but what're you gonna do, Lieutenant!?"]
 54:  813| [45] [Once Jun asked this, Kazami held out something to her and Watase.]
 55:  839| [47] [Kazami]
 56:  842| [45] ["I'll use this."]
 57:  847| [45] [--It was the damaged ampule that'd been lying near Dojima's body just minutes ago.]
 58:  852| [45] [Only half of it still remained, the other half having leaked out through the cracks in the container.]
 59:  860| [47] [Watase]
 60:  863| [45] ["N-no way... You're not seriously gonna try keeping your body protected with only half a dose, are you!?"]
 61:  871| [47] [Kazami]
 62:  874| [45] ["What do -you- think, Mr. Ukita?"]
 63:  902| [47] [Ukita]
 64:  905| [45] ["W-well, let me think... if the drug's dosage has been halved, then that means the effects should also be halved..."]
 65:  931| [47] [Ukita]
 66:  934| [45] ["Or maybe it'll only be effective for half the time... Honestly, I don't know."]
 67:  960| [47] [Kazami]
 68:  963| [45] ["But you -are- saying that it's better than nothing at all, right?"]
 69:  989| [47] [Ukita]
 70:  992| [45] ["Well, yes, that's true, but--"]
 71: 1018| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1021| [45] ["W-wait a minute! It's still way too risky!"]
 73: 1026| [45] [Jun showed her Procyon to Kazami.]
 74: 1052| [47] [Jun]
 75: 1055| [45] ["The Procyon's reading is currently at '2035 mSv'! Not only is this level life-threatening as it is, but it's still rising, you know that!?"]
 76: 1063| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1066| [45] ["She's right! If this AD's effects don't properly manifest, then you'll be exposed--"]
 78: 1092| [47] [Kazami]
 79: 1095| [45] ["Then what do you propose we do? The fact remains that we don't have enough AD."]
 80: 1103| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1106| [45] ["I'll be taking the damaged AD no matter what you say."]
 82: 1132| [47] [Jun]
 83: 1135| [45] ["But..."]
 84: 1161| [47] [Kazami]
 85: 1164| [45] ["No backtalk, Moribe!"]
 86: 1271| [47] [Jun]
 87: 1274| [45] ["!"]
 88: 1279| [45] [Kazami's angry shouts echoed through the hallway as if to ward off Jun's pleas.]
 89: 1287| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1290| [45] ["This is an order! You're wasting valuable time complaining about this!"]
 91: 1298| [47] [Kazami]
 92: 1301| [45] ["We're all being exposed to radiation right now, at this very second!"]
 93: 1309| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 1312| [45] ["If you're worried about me, then please administer the AD right now and continue the search!"]
 95: 1329| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1332| [45] ["...!"]
 97: 1337| [45] [Kazami's face was brimming with determination.]
 98: 1342| [45] [When Watase and Jun saw that, they realized that there was no use in trying to persuade her.]
 99: 1350| [47] [Watase]
100: 1353| [45] ["Moribe... let's do as Tachibana says."]
101: 1379| [47] [Jun]
102: 1382| [45] ["Y-yeah...!"]
103: 1472| [45] [Watase and Jun hurriedly injected themselves with AD.]
104: 1483| [45] [Kazami also injected herself with the damaged AD--]
105: 1488| [45] [She then turned to Ukita and the others and spoke.]
106: 1496| [45] [Though he was overwhelmed by her menacing attitude-- Watase still argued back.]
107: 1504| [47] [Watase]
108: 1507| [45] ["No, wait, I'll inject myself with the half-dose of AD!"]
109: 1515| [47] [Watase]
110: 1518| [45] ["I can't let a woman do something so reckless!"]
111: 1590| [47] [Kazami]
112: 1593| [45] ["Woman!? Did you just call me 'woman'!? Is that why you're trying to be considerate!?"]
113: 1601| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1604| [45] ["Please do not get so conceited! I believe you agreed to obey my orders when we set out, did you not!?"]
115: 1612| [47] [Kazami]
116: 1615| [45] ["Then be silent and do as I say!"]
117: 1620| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase.]
118: 1632| [45] [But he didn't back down.]
119: 1710| [47] [Watase]
120: 1713| [45] ["Just hand it over!"]
121: 1739| [47] [Kazami]
122: 1742| [45] ["Ah!"]
123: 1753| [45] [Watase snatched the damaged AD out of Kazami's hands and injected himself with it.]
124: 1779| [47] [Kazami]
125: 1782| [45] ["Wha... what have you done!?"]
126: 1790| [47] [Watase]
127: 1793| [45] ["I had no choice... talking wasn't going to get us anywhere."]
128: 1798| [45] [Watase gave Kazami the undamaged AD and spoke.]
129: 1806| [47] [Watase]
130: 1809| [45] ["Come on, hurry up and inject yourself with this. You were the one who said time was valuable."]
131: 1835| [47] [Kazami]
132: 1838| [45] ["...!"]
133: 1864| [47] [Kazami]
134: 1867| [45] ["Understood!"]
135: 1879| [45] [Kazami injected herself with the AD as if she'd resigned herself.]
136: 1926| [45] [Jun quickly followed suit.]
137: 1984| [45] [Kazami sighed, then spoke to Ukita and the others.]
138: 1993| [47] [Watase]
139: 1994| [45] [(Khh... so persuading her won't do it!?)]
140: 1999| [45] [It was at that moment that Jun whispered to Watase.]
141: 2025| [47] [Jun]
142: 2028| [45] ["Captain... let's do as the Lieutenant says. You can't overturn the chain of command."]
143: 2036| [47] [Watase]
144: 2039| [45] ["R-right...!"]
145: 2044| [45] [Watase and Jun reluctantly injected themselves with AD.]
146: 2134| [45] [Kazami breathed a relieved sigh and spoke to Ukita and the others.]
147: 2160| [47] [Kazami]
148: 2163| [45] ["... I apologize for causing you trouble. Now we've all finished injecting ourselves, correct?"]
149: 2247| [47] [Ukita]
150: 2250| [45] ["R-right...!"]
151: 2258| [47] [Ena]
152: 2261| [45] ["Y-you're right."]
153: 2266| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2267| [45] ["..."]
155: 2272| [45] [They were most likely still taken aback from seeing the altercation between the rescue workers.]
156: 2277| [45] [Ukita and the others were now quiet, like their fight mere minutes ago had never happened.]
157: 2381| [47] [Kazami]
158: 2384| [45] ["Now then, with that roadblock out of the way... let's talk about our next move."]
159: 2389| [45] [Kazami spoke with a calm voice, betraying none of the anxiety she must have felt from her coworker's death and the lack of AD.]
160: 2415| [47] [Kazami]
161: 2418| [45] ["First of all, we've more or less completed our search of Area 3, with the exception of the B1 outer ring."]
162: 2426| [47] [Kazami]
163: 2429| [45] ["However, we can't get in because the security slot is broken."]
164: 2455| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2458| [45] ["So we were planning on moving on to Area 4 next... but are all you non-rescue personnel all right?"]
166: 2485| [47] [Ukita]
167: 2488| [45] ["D-define 'all right'."]
168: 2514| [47] [Kazami]
169: 2517| [45] ["What I mean is if you feel mentally fit to keep on searching... right after you've seen those corpses."]
170: 2559| [47] [Yuuri]
171: 2562| [45] ["...!"]
172: 2567| [45] [Ukita and Yuuri gasped at those words-- but in contrast, Ena replied in a subdued tone.]
173: 2593| [47] [Ena]
174: 2596| [45] ["Of course I'll keep on going."]
175: 2604| [47] [Watase]
176: 2607| [45] ["I see. Then come with us."]
177: 2633| [47] [Ukita]
178: 2636| [45] ["B-but... that killer really could still be lurking around...!"]
179: 2662| [47] [Ena]
180: 2665| [45] ["You're still on about that, Mr. Ukita!?"]
181: 2691| [47] [Ena]
182: 2694| [45] ["I get that you think it's too dangerous to move around, but if you want to stay here, then you're on your own."]
183: 2720| [47] [Ena]
184: 2723| [45] ["But if you -don't- move, you just might be waiting for death, right?"]
185: 2749| [47] [Ukita]
186: 2752| [45] ["..."]
187: 2760| [47] [Watase]
188: 2763| [45] ["She's right. And besides, we have no AD right now... to be honest, it'd be better to have an extra helping hand with the search."]
189: 2791| [47] [Ena]
190: 2794| [45] [".... There's also Lieutenant Tachibana's health to consider as well. We should help with the search to ensure we can get some AD as well."]
191: 2803| [47] [Ena]
192: 2806| [45] [".... There's also Captain Kasasagi's health to consider as well. We should help with the search to ensure we can get some AD as well."]
193: 2832| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2835| [45] ["Y-you make good points..."]
195: 2840| [45] [Ukita reluctantly nodded. It seemed even he with all his stubbornness had realized how harsh the situation was.]
196: 2959| [47] [Jun]
197: 2962| [45] ["What do you want to do, Yuuri...?"]
198: 2967| [47] [Yuuri]
199: 2968| [45] ["..."]
200: 2994| [47] [Yuuri]
201: 2997| [45] ["... I-I'll come along with you guys."]
202: 3025| [47] [Kazami]
203: 3028| [45] ["Yes, it would be much safer that way. Having everyone within eyesight would be best."]
204: 3033| [45] [Kazami then turned her head.]
205: 3038| [45] [She was looking at the Area 4 connecting passageway.]
206: 3046| [47] [Kazami]
207: 3049| [45] ["Then let's head over to the next area. Fortunately, it appears that security terminal is still intact."]
208: 3057| [47] [Watase]
209: 3060| [45] ["... Yeah."]
210: 3065| [45] [And with that low voice, the group started walking off again.]
