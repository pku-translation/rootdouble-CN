  0:  107| [45] [--After they reunited with Watase in Area 1--]
  1:  112| [45] [The group rescued "Yuuri", a civilian who'd been caught up in the accident...]
  2:  160| [45] [... but Watase had lost his memories.]
  3:  244| [45] [Jun was worried about him too-- but despite Watase's condition, he still told them this:]
  4:  330| [47] [Watase]
  5:  333| [45] ["--Let me help out with rescuing any other survivors!"]
  6:  341| [47] [Jun]
  7:  344| [45] ["Huh? You sure you'll be okay, Captain?"]
  8:  370| [47] [Watase]
  9:  373| [45] ["It's true that I don't remember all that much and that I might just be a burden in your eyes..."]
 10:  399| [47] [Watase]
 11:  402| [45] ["But that doesn't change that I'm still a rescue worker, right? So I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I just sat on the sidelines while you're all still hard at work."]
 12:  407| [45] [Those words moved Jun.]
 13:  415| [47] [Jun]
 14:  418| [45] ["... Wow, that sounded pretty badass."]
 15:  444| [47] [Watase]
 16:  447| [45] ["No, I think it's normal. I'd hate having to force only women to work."]
 17:  455| [47] [Jun]
 18:  458| [45] ["Hmm, I hate it when people treat me like a girl... but I like your guts."]
 19:  466| [47] [Jun]
 20:  469| [45] ["Well, there's always the possibility you could get caught in a fire if you stay here, and we gotta keep shooting you up with AD..."]
 21:  477| [47] [Jun]
 22:  480| [45] ["So maybe having you come with us would be the safest bet after all."]
 23:  506| [47] [Watase]
 24:  509| [45] ["All right! Then--"]
 25:  532| [47] [Jun]
 26:  535| [45] ["However!"]
 27:  586| [45] [Jun swiftly pointed at Watase's nose.]
 28:  594| [47] [Jun]
 29:  597| [45] ["This is no ordinary mission. So if you wanna stay with us as a rescue worker, then you've gotta be ready to accept the responsibilities and duties that come with it."]
 30:  658| [47] [Watase]
 31:  661| [45] ["...!"]
 32:  669| [47] [Jun]
 33:  672| [45] ["You'll be treated as a new recruit until you get your memory back. So basically, you'll be in the same boat as me."]
 34:  680| [47] [Jun]
 35:  683| [45] ["I know I'm being real rude here, but you could die otherwise, so... You good with all that?"]
 36:  709| [47] [Watase]
 37:  712| [45] ["Y-yeah! Of course!"]
 38:  717| [45] [Jun's heart warmed when she saw Watase answer so obediently.]
 39:  722| [47] [Jun]
 40:  723| [45] [(He's always so cool-headed... but it looks like he can be cute too.)]
 41:  731| [47] [Jun]
 42:  734| [45] ["Alrighty! Then I'll back you up all the way, so let's both do our best together!"]
 43:  760| [47] [Watase]
 44:  763| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 45:  768| [45] [--They then reformed their team and continued their search.]
 46:  776| [45] [Jun hadn't especially liked him since he was always blunt and cold, but she was worried about him this one time.]
 47:  781| [45] [--Be that as it were, they reformed the team and continued the search.]
 48:  849| [45] [They then saved a woman stuck in the connecting passageway between Areas 2 and 3.]
 49:  854| [45] [But she grew very angry after she was told about the situation and started harping on the group.]
 50:  938| [47] [Ena]
 51:  941| [45] ["No way... What do you mean, 'the bulkheads are shut'!?"]
 52:  967| [47] [Kazami]
 53:  970| [45] ["We can't figure out why it happened either...!"]
 54:  996| [47] [Ena]
 55:  999| [45] ["Then why don't you just destroy the damn thing with some sort of special equipment or something!?"]
 56: 1007| [47] [Jun]
 57: 1010| [45] ["We've tried everything we can! But not even our engine cutter could make a dent in that thing!"]
 58: 1036| [47] [Kazami]
 59: 1039| [45] ["We can't destroy the bulkhead with any of the equipment we have on hand."]
 60: 1065| [47] [Ena]
 61: 1068| [45] ["Hmph! I never thought a rescue squad could be this useless!"]
 62: 1076| [47] [Jun]
 63: 1079| [45] ["...!"]
 64: 1105| [47] [Kazami]
 65: 1108| [45] ["It's true that -we- can't destroy it with our equipment-- but the workers on the surface should have explosives with them."]
 66: 1116| [47] [Kazami]
 67: 1119| [45] ["So it's only a matter of time before that bulkhead is destroyed and reinforcements come.%NSo please try to understand for now."]
 68: 1145| [47] [Ena]
 69: 1148| [45] ["... I see, then I guess there's nothing you can do about it."]
 70: 1153| [45] [The woman let out an exasperated sigh.]
 71: 1232| [47] [Jun]
 72: 1235| [45] ["Now wait just a minute, lady...!"]
 73: 1240| [45] [Unable to sit back and let her continue berating them, Jun planned to give the woman a warning, but Kazami held her back.]
 74: 1266| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1269| [45] ["More importantly, we need to give her some AD."]
 76: 1295| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1298| [45] ["Oh, you're right! She'll be in big trouble without it!"]
 78: 1324| [47] [Ena]
 79: 1327| [45] ["AD? What's that?"]
 80: 1335| [47] [Kazami]
 81: 1338| [45] ["Well you see, it's--"]
 82: 1407| [45] [Kazami explained AD to the woman.]
 83: 1412| [45] [She also told her about the radiation filling the facility, the danger standards, and the Procyon.]
 84: 1417| [45] [The woman's attitude took a complete 180 after she'd heard all that.]
 85: 1450| [47] [Ena]
 86: 1453| [45] ["R-radiation...!?"]
 87: 1461| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1464| [45] ["That's correct. Furthermore, subjective symptoms of radiation damage easily appear in the internal organs, skin, and eyes."]
 89: 1472| [47] [Kazami]
 90: 1475| [45] ["Are you experiencing any nausea, skin pain, or blurry vision?"]
 91: 1501| [47] [Ena]
 92: 1504| [45] ["No, I think I'm feeling okay..."]
 93: 1530| [47] [Watase]
 94: 1533| [45] ["Good. Then you'll be fine as long as we give you some AD now."]
 95: 1541| [47] [Jun]
 96: 1544| [45] ["But you'd better do it quick, you hear? If you don't, then you won't be around to keep telling us off like that."]
 97: 1570| [47] [Ena]
 98: 1573| [45] ["O... okay. Then all I have to do is inject myself with this?"]
 99: 1581| [47] [Jun]
100: 1584| [45] ["Righto, now that's better."]
101: 1589| [45] [She wasn't thrilled by the woman's attitude, but Jun decided to let it go for now.]
102: 1594| [45] [She felt that it was her natural duty as a rescue worker.]
103: 1799| [45] [--So as Watase's place in Jun's heart grows--]
104: 1804| [45] [A new memory relating to him comes back to life from the innermost depths of her mind.]
