  1:   59| [45] [Watase's search continued fruitlessly--]
  2:   65| [45] [There were no results in the effort to rejoin with Ukita, and so the search continued--]
  3:  122| [45] [--eventually ending at the "reference room".]
  4:  127| [45] [Watase looked toward one of the bookshelves inside and found it to be tightly packed with books and theses.]
  5:  132| [45] ["An Introduction to the Informational Field Theory/Author: Miyoko Tenkawa"]
  6:  137| [45] ["Elementary Particles, Information, and Consciousness/Author: Miyoko Tenkawa"]
  7:  142| [45] ["ESP Synchronization Hypothesis/Author: Antoine Courbet  Translator: Miyoko Tenkawa"]

 11:  162| [45] ["Particles, the Mind, and the Brain/Author: Shuuya Eriguchi"]
 12:  167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  168| [45] [(... A lot of these seem to be written by Mom, but--)]
 14:  173| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  174| [45] [("Informational field"? "ESP synchronization"? What on Earth is Mom researching?)]
 16:  179| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 17:  180| [45] [(Do those things relate to nuclear power research...?)]
 18:  185| [45] [As if influenced by the curiosity in Natsuhiko's consciousness, Watase picked up the book "An Introduction to the Informational Field Theory/Author: Miyoko Tenkawa".]
 19:  229| [45] ["An Introduction to the Informational Field Theory"]
 20:  232| [85] [　]
 21:  235| [45] [<Foreword>]
 22:  238| [45] [In modern physics, all phenomena that shape the natural world can be explained with four fundamental forces.]
 23:  241| [45] [But there are phenomena such as the accelerating universe and so on that cannot be explained by these four fundamental forces alone.]
 24:  244| [45] [It has become clear from recent high precision observation that the rate at which the universe expands accelerates with time.]
 25:  247| [45] [It is from that survey that the theory of an unknown energy known as dark energy (repulsive gravity) was born.]
 26:  250| [45] [But if dark energy supposedly does exist, then what is it?]
 27:  253| [45] [Various conjectures have been conceived, but they are all merely speculation.]
 28:  257| [85] [ %N]
 29:  260| [45] [Thus I continued to look into that force from the perspective of an elementary particle physicist, and formulated a hypothesis:]
 30:  263| [45] [Could it be "information"?]
 31:  266| [45] [If a fifth fundamental force does indeed exist, there is a high possibility that it is in fact "information".]
 32:  269| [45] [I used a numerical formula to express the equivalence of information volume and energy,]
 33:  272| [45] [then after deriving its value, I discovered that said value completely matched up with the rate of universal expansion.]
 34:  275| [45] [In other words--]
 35:  301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  302| [45] [(Dark energy...?)]
 37:  307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  308| [45] [(I don't really get it, but Mom seems to think its true form is "information", huh.)]
 39:  313| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  314| [45] [(Now that I think about it, Prof. Tsubakiyama said that information is a type of energy during her lecture too, didn't she?)]
 41:  319| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  320| [45] [(But what is this thesis trying to say, then...?)]
 43:  364| [45] [--The following conjecture is based off this theory.]
 44:  367| [85] [　]
 45:  370| [45] [* Even information itself can exist independently, and can possibly interact (be conveyed) without the use of other forces as an intermediary.]
 46:  373| [45] [* For example, since a human's thoughts are a type of "information", they can communicate with others without the need for those thoughts to be converted into another medium (such as electrical signals).]
 47:  376| [85] [　]
 48:  379| [45] [This is a somewhat extreme expression I am using here, but this is the gist of the "informational field hypothesis".]
 49:  382| [45] [The "informational field" is the place where "information" operates (as the fifth fundamental force/energy).]
 50:  385| [45] [If we are to consider this by using the human brain as an example, the "informational field" generated from thought information may in fact be what we call the "consciousness".]
 51:  395| [45] [It is still unclear as of this point as to what the process that creates a "consciousness" entails.]
 52:  398| [45] [All we do know is that a consciousness is generated inside the brain when]
 53:  401| [45] ["countless memories = fragments of information" and "electric signals running through the synapses" interact.]
 54:  404| [45] [However, another conjecture can be formed when you think on the basis of this hypothesis.]
 55:  407| [45] [If information can exist independently, then that means a consciousness does not necessarily have to form in a brain.]
 56:  410| [45] [If a fixed amount of information gathers in one spot and interacts with each other, a consciousness can be born right then and there.]
 57:  413| [45] [Furthermore, if information can be controlled--]
 58:  416| [45] [Then it should also be possible to artificially "create a consciousness".]
 59:  442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  443| [45] [(Artificially "create a consciousness"...!?)]
 61:  448| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  449| [45] [(I can't see how that research has anything to do with nuclear power science...)]
 63:  454| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64:  455| [45] [(... No, wait, maybe I'm mistaken?)]
 65:  460| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66:  461| [45] [(LABO's full name is the "6th Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization", right?)]
 67:  466| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 68:  467| [45] [(So maybe Mom wasn't researching the Atomic part, but the Biological part...?)]
 69:  511| [45] [... In conclusion, the various theories laid out in the "informational field hypothesis" have yet to be proven.]
 70:  514| [45] [But this thesis has been reappraised in a form I never once expected.]
 71:  517| [45] [This is all due to a rapid yet drastic change that has recently swept society.]
 72:  520| [45] [That change is the manifestation of "BC".]
 73:  524| [45] [The ability known as "BC" has been widely acknowledged by society in the last few years.]
 74:  527| [45] [It can be said that this has resulted in mindsets towards the nature of "information" and ways of communication to undergo tremendous changes.]
 75:  530| [45] [We have also discovered countless people who possess this ability that we never would have conceived as feasible mere years ago.]
 76:  533| [45] [The abilities of "BC" can generally be classified into two groups.]
 77:  536| [85] [　]
 78:  539| [45] [The first one is "telepathy", the ability to directly send your voice to another's mind.]
 79:  542| [45] [The other is "empathy", the ability to read the voice of another's mind.]
 80:  545| [85] [　]
 81:  548| [45] [By describing these two abilities with these extremely coherent terms,%Nwe can explain them separately.]
 82:  558| [45] [When BC is used, the user's "thought information" is not converted into another medium.]
 83:  561| [45] [They communicate with their target by sending that thought information directly into their target's brain by using elementary particles as an intermediary.]
 84:  564| [45] [This matches up with what I proposed in my "informational field hypothesis".]
 85:  567| [45] [Two completely unrelated fields of study-- parapsychology and elementary particle physics-- are connected by BC.]
 86:  577| [45] [Furthermore, while telepathy practitioners are still few, empathy practitioners are even rarer.]
 87:  580| [45] [But the true number of users is not what's important here.]
 88:  583| [45] [It's the fact that an ability such as empathy exists.]
 89:  586| [45] [And also the fact that the existence of "information" known as the "voice of the mind" can be observed by others despite previously being unknown to those other than the thinkers themselves.]
 90:  589| [45] [This is indeed the first and biggest paradigm shift of the 21st century.]
 91:  616| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  617| [45] [(She's suddenly talking about BC now...)]
 93:  622| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94:  623| [45] [("Creating a consciousness", "nuclear power", "biology", "BC"... how do these four things connect...?)]
 95:  628| [45] [As Natsuhiko harbored that question-- Watase suddenly spoke up.]
 96:  682| [47] [Watase]
 97:  685| [45] ["'The ability to read another's mind'...!?"]
 98:  712| [47] [Watase]
 99:  715| [45] ["T-Teach... is what this book says for real?"]
100:  741| [47] [Ena]
101:  744| [45] ["Huh?"]
102:  752| [47] [Watase]
103:  755| [45] ["Is this 'empathy' thing... real?"]
104:  781| [47] [Ena]
105:  784| [45] ["Y-yes. I didn't mention it?"]
106:  792| [47] [Ena]
107:  795| [45] ["I told you that 'BC was the ability to mutually communicate your ideas to people far away', right?"]
108:  821| [47] [Ena]
109:  824| [45] ["I didn't just mean that you could send your mind's voice to another, but also to read theirs."]
110:  832| [47] [Watase]
111:  835| [45] ["...!"]
112:  884| [45] [Various doubts suddenly rose up within Watase's mind.]
113:  914| [45] ["Why did Yuuri disappear?"]
114:  952| [45] ["Why did Salyu run away?"]
115: 1038| [45] ["Why haven't the other three survivors been found yet?"]
116: 1043| [45] [But the strongest thought in Watase's mind was--]
117: 1312| [85] [{If those kids can read people's minds...}]
118: 1313| [86] [Watase]
119: 1314| [86] [{If those kids can read people's minds...}]
120: 1331| [85] [{And when you take into account they've been running from us...]
121: 1333| [85] [then maybe one of us]
122: 1335| [85] [hates them and they know it...!}]
123: 1336| [86] [Watase]
124: 1337| [86] [{And when you take into account they've been running from us... then maybe one of us hates them and they know it...!}]
125: 1365| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1366| [45] [(--!!)]
127: 1371| [45] [Natsuhiko was frightened by the conclusion Watase was drawing towards.]
128: 1376| [45] [There was an extremely high probability that the girl who called herself Yuuri was a Communicator.]
129: 1381| [45] [And it was most likely true that Yuuri and Salyu were running away from someone who hated them.]
130: 1386| [45] [The only thing Watase was missing was the self-awareness that the one who hated them was none other than he himself.]
131: 1391| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1392| [45] [(Crap! If Watase realizes that fact--!)]
133: 1508| [85] [{Communicators aren't human.]
134: 1510| [85] [They're mind-corrupting monsters.}]
135: 1511| [86] [Watase]
136: 1512| [86] [{Communicators aren't human. They're mind-corrupting monsters.}]
137: 1527| [85] [{This is a monster hunt...!]
138: 1529| [85] [Kill or be killed...!}]
139: 1530| [86] [Watase]
140: 1531| [86] [{This is a monster hunt...! Kill or be killed...!}]
141: 1546| [85] [{Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,]
142: 1548| [85] [kill, kill, kill, kill...}]
143: 1549| [86] [Watase]
144: 1550| [86] [{Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...}]
145: 1578| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness vividly recalled the hatred and murderous intent he had seen within Watase back then.]
146: 1646| [47] [Natsuhiko]
147: 1647| [45] [(Dammit! I need to do something about Watase's memory right away!)]
148: 1652| [45] [But as soon as Natsuhiko tried to interfere with Watase's memory,]
149: 1736| [47] [Watase]
150: 1739| [45] ["Ghh... ugh...!"]
151: 1744| [45] [Watase was suddenly struck by an intense headache.]
152: 1834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 1835| [45] [(Wh-why!? I haven't even done anything yet--!)]
154: 1853| [45] [In light of the unexpected situation, Natsuhiko panicked and loosened his concentration--]
155: 1907| [45] [Watase flew out of the reference room and rushed into a nearby restroom.]
156: 1933| [45] [That's when Ena noticed Watase was acting strange.]
157: 1941| [47] [Ena]
158: 1944| [45] ["What's wrong!?"]
159: 1952| [47] [Watase]
160: 1955| [45] ["I-I... just started feeling sick...!"]
161: 1981| [47] [Ena]
162: 1984| [45] ["Huh!? Are you okay!?"]
163: 1992| [47] [Watase]
164: 1995| [45] ["S-sorry... but I've gotta go to the bathroom...!"]
165: 2003| [47] [Watase]
166: 2006| [45] ["Wait here for me...!"]
167: 2032| [47] [Ena]
168: 2035| [45] ["H-hold on a minute!"]
169: 2090| [45] [But Watase shook off Ena's voice of concern and flew out of the reference room--]
170: 2095| [45] [--And then he rushed into a nearby restroom.]
