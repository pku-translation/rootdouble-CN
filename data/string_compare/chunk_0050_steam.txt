  0:    1| [55] [âˆšAfter Chapter 3]
  1:    5| [47] [Watase]
  2:    6| [45] [(Oh right, are the others okay...!?)]
  3:   11| [45] [Watase looked around him, setting his eyes on Kazami first.]
  4:   16| [45] [And a second later, she--]
  5:   44| [47] [Kazami]
  6:   47| [45] ["Captain, Ms. Yuuri, thank God you're all right!!"]
  7:   52| [45] [--ran up to Watase and Yuuri as she said that, then embraced the two of them.]
  8:  178| [47] [Watase]
  9:  181| [45] ["Whoa!?"]
 10:  189| [47] [Yuuri]
 11:  192| [45] ["Wah!"]
 12:  197| [45] [Kazami paid no heed to their surprise and started talking in a tear-choked voice.]
 13:  205| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  208| [45] ["You really had me worried there...! It felt like my heart was about to stop at any second..."]
 15:  216| [47] [Watase]
 16:  219| [45] ["I-it's okay, Yuuri and I are fine... but..."]
 17:  227| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  230| [45] ["U-um, it's a bit hard to breathe..."]
 19:  235| [45] [Kazami's arms of steel felt like they were crushing Watase and Yuuri's throats.]
 20:  243| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  246| [45] ["Huh? ... Ah! My apologies!"]
 22:  251| [45] [She frantically loosened her grip when she realized this. However--]
 23:  259| [47] [Watase]
 24:  262| [45] ["... Uh, hey, Ms. Tachibana?"]
 25:  270| [47] [Watase]
 26:  273| [45] ["... Why aren't you letting go?"]
 27:  281| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  284| [45] ["It's okay if we stay like this for a little longer, isn't it?"]
 29:  292| [47] [Kazami]
 30:  295| [45] ["What just happened was incredibly dangerous, so please just let me express my thanks for you having survived."]
 31:  303| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  306| [45] ["After all, I don't want to imagine what would have happened if we'd made even the slightest mistake just now..."]
 33:  311| [45] [Kazami said that and gave Watase and Yuuri a nice pat on the back.]
 34:  316| [45] [Upon which, Yuuri--]
 35:  324| [47] [Yuuri]
 36:  327| [45] ["..."]
 37:  332| [45] [--began to tremble as the reality of what they'd just been through only now finally hit her.]
 38:  380| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  383| [45] ["... That really was scary, wasn't it?"]
 40:  391| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  394| [45] ["Y... yes...!"]
 42:  402| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  405| [45] ["... You held up so good back there without even crying, you know that? But you're safe now."]
 44:  410| [45] [Kazami said that and gently stroked Yuuri's hair.]
 45:  415| [45] [The warmth from Kazami's arms flowed into Watase.]
 46:  420| [45] [He also felt Yuuri's heat flood into him from their shoulders that were now connected from the hug they were locked in.]
 47:  425| [45] [It was then that Watase felt himself fully reconnect with reality again.]
 48:  430| [47] [Watase]
 49:  431| [45] [(That's right... we survived.)]
 50:  436| [47] [Watase]
 51:  437| [45] [(We made it out of there with our lives...)]
 52:  442| [45] [There was a path to survival even in such a desperate crisis like that.]
 53:  447| [45] [And the one who'd carved that path open for them was their most reliable comrade-- Kazami.]
 54:  452| [45] [Watase gently hugged her back.]
 55:  457| [45] [Yuuri's arms soon overlapped with Watase's.]
 56:  462| [45] [The three of them just stood in that embrace for a while, not saying a word.]
 57:  573| [45] [--Eventually, Jun cut up the atmosphere up with a teasing voice.]
 58:  581| [47] [Jun]
 59:  584| [45] ["Wooow, it really is good to be the captain, huh? I mean, you get free hugs from Lieutenant Stone Face and everything."]
 60:  589| [45] [The three of them turned around in surprise to see the rest of the group grinning at them.]
 61:  597| [47] [Ukita]
 62:  600| [45] ["I must admit, I'm a tad jealous. You must be feeling really, really nice right about now."]
 63:  608| [47] [Ena]
 64:  611| [45] ["Well, I'd say it was well deserved. It's thanks to him that Ms. Yuuri's alive."]
