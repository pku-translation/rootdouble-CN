  0:   60| [45] [--And then came the day of fate.]
  1:   65| [45] [September 16, 2030, 6:19 AM]
  2:   70| [45] [LABO's automatic disaster prevention system sent a rescue request to Sirius.]
  3:   75| [45] ["An accident involving explosions of unknown origin has occurred within the facility.%NPlease dispatch at once".]
  4:   80| [45] [Watase and the others accepted that request and sped off towards LABO.]
  5:  150| [45] [Watase addressed his subordinates as they lined up, all of them garbed in the same type of protection suit he was wearing.]
  6:  158| [47] [Watase]
  7:  161| [45] ["Excellent. Listen up, people!"]
  8:  169| [47] [Watase]
  9:  172| [45] ["Countless people are trapped in this lab as we speak!"]
 10:  180| [47] [Watase]
 11:  183| [45] ["And due to the nature of this facility, this will be no ordinary..."]
 12:  188| [45] [--Everything was going according to plan.]
 13:  193| [45] [Ukita had caused a commotion by detonating the bombs in the facility, while Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama had successfully invaded LABO without any resistance.]
 14:  201| [47] [Watase]
 15:  204| [45] ["--Form two-man cells! Tachibana, you're with Moribe! Dojima, you're with Hiyama!"]
 16:  212| [47] [Watase]
 17:  215| [45] ["Make sure to keep in constant contact with Team B! Don't forget this!"]
 18:  278| [45] [His four subordinates then rushed into the facility as soon as Watase finished giving out his orders.]
 19:  283| [45] [He then stayed on the surface floor for a little while afterwards, directing rescue efforts to make sure none of the other squad members became an obstacle to the plan.]
 20:  339| [45] [Furthermore, Watase and the others had already administered the AD they'd been supplied with by LABO.]
 21:  344| [45] [Ukita had already told him that it wasn't anti-radiation medicine, but rather an anti-BC protective agent.]
 22:  349| [45] [There was no fear of radiation exposure, but administering themselves with AD would be necessary for their rescue of the Communicators.]
 23:  354| [47] [Watase]
 24:  355| [45] [(It'd be bad if we didn't prepare ourselves for every little thing that could go wrong.)]
 25:  407| [47] [Watase]
 26:  408| [45] [(If those test subjects trapped here have the same kind of power as "A", then there's a chance they could contaminate our minds via BC.)]
 27:  413| [45] [Watase thought that over.]
 28:  464| [45] [--At 6:34 AM, he got a radio transmission from Dojima and Hiyama.]
 29:  469| [47] [Dojima]
 30:  472| [45] ["Kasasagi, get to the basement ASAP!"]
 31:  477| [47] [Hiyama]
 32:  480| [45] ["Hurry! There's no time!"]
 33:  485| [45] [They didn't call Watase "Captain".]
 34:  490| [45] [That was only natural. They weren't here for work today.]
 35:  495| [45] [Those two were his friends of many years who all talked to each other as equals without any regards for ranking when they were off the job.]
 36:  503| [47] [Watase]
 37:  506| [45] ["Roger that, just wait right there!"]
 38:  517| [45] [This too was all going according to plan.]
 39:  522| [45] [Even if Commander Murakami had intercepted their transmission, he shouldn't have found it suspicious at all.]
 40:  573| [45] [Watase regrouped with Dojima and Hiyama in Area 2.]
 41:  578| [45] [On their way, they were faced with the inconvenience of encountering the students they'd threatened and tied up yesterday (though how they'd broken free and made it there to begin with was its own question)--]
 42:  583| [45] [--but the kids quickly retreated, leaving the three comrades to press onwards.]
 43:  588| [45] [They then carried the two unconscious high ranked researchers with them and headed on over to Area 3.]
 44:  657| [45] [Ukita was waiting for them in the surveillance room.]
 45:  662| [45] [He had been observing the situation in the facility from there as he guided the evacuation of the staff through the room's intercom.]
 46:  670| [47] [Ukita]
 47:  673| [45] ["Oh, you came at the perfect time!"]
 48:  681| [47] [Ukita]
 49:  684| [45] ["I just got a call from the surface confirming that all of the staff has evacuated, with the exception of those two."]
 50:  690| [45] [By "those two", he was of course referring to the high ranked researchers that Dojima and Hiyama were carrying.]
 51:  698| [47] [Ukita]
 52:  701| [45] ["What's more, I just finished using Brain Cell to make the WX particle amplifier go haywire."]
 53:  709| [47] [Ukita]
 54:  712| [45] ["This means that the bulkheads will be closed for a long time once the Case N has been declared."]
 55:  720| [47] [Ukita]
 56:  723| [45] ["According to Brain Cell's calculations, the lockdown won't lift until '6:16 PM'."]
 57:  731| [47] [Watase]
 58:  734| [45] ["Good... everything's going exactly as planned."]
 59:  742| [45] [The rescue workers checked their gear.]
 60:  747| [45] [They stole the security cards they needed to break into Area N from the high ranked researchers.]
 61:  752| [45] [Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama each had one pistol.]
 62:  757| [45] [Furthermore, they had the jackhammer they planned to use to escape through the pipe, and a fire axe as a backup.]
 63:  762| [45] [Last, they had the "tetryl bomb"-- the time bomb prepared by Q that held enough power to wipe out LABO in one blast.]
 64:  916| [47] [Ukita]
 65:  919| [45] ["... Sorry, but could you set the bomb's timer here? I'd rather make sure that we don't get the time wrong."]
 66:  927| [47] [Watase]
 67:  930| [45] ["Sure thing. Set it for 6:17 PM, right?"]
 68:  935| [45] [Watase then took out his PDA.]
 69:  980| [45] [Located in his PDA's data folder was the program to activate the tetryl bomb.]
 70: 1040| [45] [After he input the password and started up the program, the menu to set the time bomb appeared on screen.]
 71: 1287| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1290| [45] ["... Now all that's left is to plant this thing in Area Zero."]
 73: 1298| [47] [Ukita]
 74: 1301| [45] ["Now we can't turn back, huh?"]
 75: 1306| [45] [Watase nodded quietly in response.]
 76: 1311| [45] [The program could only activate the bomb-- there was no option to deactivate it.]
 77: 1316| [45] [A sensor on the bomb would activate starting at 8:17 AM to prevent anyone from disarming it. No one would be able to stop it then.]
 78: 1363| [47] [Watase]
 79: 1366| [45] ["We'll head on down to Area Zero and rescue the test subjects."]
 80: 1374| [47] [Ukita]
 81: 1377| [45] ["I'll stay here and keep an eye out to make sure nothing unexpected happens."]
 82: 1385| [47] [Ukita]
 83: 1388| [45] ["Furthermore, the WX particles in Area N should exceed '4000 mSv' 20 minutes from now."]
 84: 1396| [47] [Ukita]
 85: 1399| [45] ["The effects of AD will wear off when it exceeds that level... There's no time, hurry!"]
 86: 1407| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1410| [45] ["Yeah!"]
 88: 1415| [45] [The three rescue workers left the jackhammer in Ukita's care and rushed out of the surveillance room.]
 89: 1473| [45] [They all headed for Area N, with Watase carrying the bomb while Dojima and Hiyama carried the high ranked researchers.]
 90: 1478| [45] [A thick security gate soon came into view.]
 91: 1508| [47] [Dojima]
 92: 1511| [45] ["So this is 'Area N', huh..."]
 93: 1541| [47] [Hiyama]
 94: 1544| [45] ["Those two are trapped just up ahead, right?"]
 95: 1552| [47] [Watase]
 96: 1555| [45] ["Right... so let's go."]
 97: 1560| [45] [Watase told his comrades that in a firm voice.]
 98: 1565| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama had also lost loved ones in the Great Arson 16 years ago.]
 99: 1570| [45] [They all knew accomplishing the plan wouldn't bring the dead back, but--]
100: 1578| [47] [Watase]
101: 1581| [45] ["Back then, we couldn't save anyone..."]
102: 1589| [47] [Watase]
103: 1592| [45] ["The time to atone for that has finally come."]
104: 1597| [45] [Engraving their conviction upon their hearts, the three comrades entered Area N.]
105: 1700| [45] [Their Procyon's alarm didn't go off even as they got in.]
106: 1705| [45] [Probably because the WX particle energy levels weren't strong enough to affect the human body yet.]
107: 1710| [45] [A transparent tube-shaped elevator lay in the center of Area N.]
108: 1715| [45] [If they swiped the Level N cards into the terminal lying next to it and forced the high ranked researchers to perform the retinal scan authentication--]
109: 1720| [45] [--then the path to B3's "Area Zero" would open.]
110: 1725| [47] [Watase]
111: 1726| [45] [(We have to hurry before these guys wake up!)]
112: 1732| [45] [The three of them approached the elevator and started fiddling with the terminal.]
113: 1743| [45] [A computer voice started playing once they swiped the security cards through the slot.]
114: 1748| [47] [Computer Voice]
115: 1751| [45] ["Authorized personnel retinal authentication required. Please bring your eye close to the sensor."]
116: 1756| [45] [They forced the unconscious researchers' eyes open and brought them towards the scanner, just as instructed.]
117: 1767| [47] [Computer Voice]
118: 1770| [45] ["--Area Zero administrator Shuuya Eriguchi retina confirmed."]
119: 1787| [47] [Computer Voice]
120: 1790| [45] ["Area Zero administrator Ryoken Kashiwagi retina confirmed."]
121: 1795| [45] [With the authentication complete, the three of them boarded the elevator.]
122: 1806| [47] [Computer Voice]
123: 1809| [45] ["Elevator descending. Please administer AD immediately in the event that you have not done so."]
124: 1836| [45] [The floor shook at the same time that announcement was made, and the elevator started descending.]
125: 1850| [45] [Once they reached the bottom, the three of them were greeted with--]
126: 1855| [45] [--a most unexpected sight.]
127: 2003| [47] [Watase]
128: 2006| [45] ["Wha... what the hell is this!?"]
129: 2076| [47] [Dojima]
130: 2079| [45] ["Something like this was under LABO all this time...?"]
131: 2112| [45] [It was a giant underground garden.]
132: 2130| [45] [Lighting that looked no different from the sunshine outside the facility illuminated their surroundings.]
133: 2135| [45] [And the ceiling and walls were a blue sky-- no, they were giant screens that projected images of the sky.]
134: 2140| [47] [Watase]
135: 2141| [45] [(Why would they build something like this...?)]
136: 2148| [47] [Watase]
137: 2149| [45] [(... No, now's not the time to wonder that. We have to hurry up and rescue the test subjects!)]
138: 2154| [45] [Watase looked around the underground garden to find six rooms built into the walls.]
139: 2159| [45] [The first one read "Relaxation Room".]
140: 2164| [45] [The one next to it read "Playroom". The test subjects probably relaxed in these rooms.]
141: 2169| [45] [On the side were two unlabeled doors. They appeared to be vacant rooms.]
142: 2174| [45] [As for the two remaining doors--]
143: 2179| [45] [One of them read "Subject Y-II" while the other read "Subject N".]
144: 2187| [47] [Watase]
145: 2190| [45] ["'Subject Y-II'... this must be the room the subject is kept in!"]
146: 2195| [45] [Watase, Dojima, and Hiyama ran up to that door.]
147: 2200| [45] [There was another security slot next to it.]
148: 2211| [45] [When they slid a Level N card into it as a test, the door opened right up.]
149: 2269| [45] [--On the other side of the door was another, thicker door.]
150: 2274| [45] [It required another retinal scan, so they forced the researchers to perform the necessary authentication again--]
151: 2337| [45] [--and the door opened with a heavy sound.]
152: 2404| [47] [Watase]
153: 2407| [45] ["Wha... is this really Subject Y-II's room?"]
154: 2412| [45] [It looked just like a normal girl's room.]
155: 2418| [45] [Bookshelves,]
156: 2434| [45] [a single bed,]
157: 2447| [45] [knitting supplies,]
158: 2460| [45] [and a dresser...]
159: 2466| [45] [He'd been expecting to find something more along the lines of a prison cell, but it looked like they gave the test subjects fairly decent accommodations.]
160: 2471| [45] [From what he could tell, it appeared that Subject Y-II was a young girl on the verge of adulthood.]
161: 2476| [45] [But the person in question-- was nowhere to be found.]
162: 2484| [47] [Watase]
163: 2487| [45] ["Impossible... no one's here!?"]
164: 2492| [45] [He looked around to discover that there was a security slot by the door on the room's side as well.]
165: 2497| [45] [He couldn't imagine that the test subjects were given security cards, so she probably couldn't have escaped on her own.]
166: 2533| [47] [Dojima]
167: 2536| [45] ["Were we tricked!?"]
168: 2566| [47] [Hiyama]
169: 2569| [45] ["Why... by whom!?"]
170: 2592| [47] [Dojima]
171: 2595| [45] ["Don't tell me Mr. Ukita's intel was fake--"]
172: 2603| [47] [Watase]
173: 2606| [45] ["Hold on, guys! There's no way that could be true!"]
174: 2611| [45] [Watase looked at the two researchers.]
175: 2619| [47] [Watase]
176: 2622| [45] ["What if these guys realized something was up and already let the test subjects escape or hid them away...!?"]
177: 2645| [47] [Dojima]
178: 2648| [45] ["Then we're in deep shit! That would mean we came all this way for nothing! Let's find them!"]
179: 2653| [45] [The three of them quickly left the room.]
180: 2704| [45] [But even after searching the Playroom, Relaxation room, and even the vacant rooms, they still hadn't found neither hide nor hair of the test subject.]
181: 2755| [47] [Watase]
182: 2758| [45] ["Wait... what if it's the same with Subject N!?"]
183: 2763| [45] [If they didn't find either of the test subjects, then the plan would have hit a serious snag.]
184: 2768| [45] [The three of them headed for Subject N's room.]
185: 2826| [45] [--But when they got to the door--]
186: 2831| [47] [Eriguchi]
187: 2834| [45] ["... Ugh... khh...!"]
188: 2839| [47] [Kashiwagi]
189: 2842| [45] ["Is... isn't this...!?"]
190: 2847| [45] [The researchers that Dojima and Hiyama were carrying woke up.]
191: 2870| [47] [Watase]
192: 2873| [45] ["!!"]
193: 2878| [45] [The three of them gasped. The researchers quickly started questioning them.]
194: 2883| [47] [Eriguchi]
195: 2886| [45] ["Who... who in the world are you people!?"]
196: 2894| [47] [Watase]
197: 2897| [45] ["... We're rescue workers."]
198: 2902| [47] [Eriguchi]
199: 2905| [45] ["Rescue workers, you say...?"]
200: 2910| [47] [Eriguchi]
201: 2913| [45] ["N-no, but-- isn't this Area Zero!?"]
202: 2918| [47] [Kashiwagi]
203: 2921| [45] ["What the hell!? What's going on!?"]
204: 2926| [47] [Kashiwagi]
205: 2929| [45] ["How did rescue workers get all the way down here!?"]
206: 2934| [45] [Watase resolved himself in an instant after hearing their onslaught of questions.]
207: 2939| [47] [Watase]
208: 2940| [45] [(No choice... I didn't want to do this, but...!)]
209: 3047| [45] [Watase took his concealed pistol out and pointed it at the researchers.]
210: 3055| [47] [Watase]
211: 3058| [45] ["Shut up! Say another word and I'll shoot!"]
212: 3063| [47] [Eriguchi]
213: 3066| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
214: 3074| [47] [Watase]
215: 3077| [45] ["While we are rescue workers, we're also members of a certain organization."]
216: 3085| [47] [Watase]
217: 3088| [45] ["'Q'-- I'm sure you've heard that name at least once or twice, yeah?"]
218: 3093| [45] [The researchers' faces froze when they heard that name.]
219: 3098| [47] [Eriguchi]
220: 3101| [45] ["D... don't tell me...!"]
221: 3106| [47] [Kashiwagi]
222: 3109| [45] ["Were all those bombings your doing!?"]
223: 3117| [47] [Watase]
224: 3120| [45] ["Bingo."]
225: 3128| [47] [Watase]
226: 3131| [45] ["Our goal is to take the test subjects away from here. We won't hurt you so long as you don't get in our way."]
227: 3136| [47] [Eriguchi]
228: 3139| [45] ["T... take them away!?"]
229: 3144| [47] [Eriguchi]
230: 3147| [45] ["Impossible! Are you saying you're going to take the Communicator inside there out of this facility!?"]
231: 3155| [47] [Watase]
232: 3158| [45] ["Bingo again. That way, the whole world will learn about what you guys have been up to here."]
233: 3163| [47] [Eriguchi]
234: 3166| [45] ["Stop! Do you people understand what it is you're trying to do!?"]
235: 3171| [47] [Eriguchi]
236: 3174| [45] ["The one in there is no ordinary Communicator! She's a genuine monster!"]
237: 3182| [47] [Watase]
238: 3185| [45] ["What the hell? You think you can scare us with weak little shit like that?"]
239: 3190| [47] [Eriguchi]
240: 3193| [45] ["She'll amplify your malice--"]
241: 3201| [47] [Watase]
242: 3204| [45] ["Dumbass. We've all taken AD."]
243: 3212| [47] [Watase]
244: 3215| [45] ["If you're trying to buy time, don't even bother! Just hurry up and open the damn door!"]
245: 3220| [47] [Eriguchi]
246: 3223| [45] ["But--!"]
247: 3284| [45] [The researcher's words were interrupted by a gunshot.]
248: 3293| [45] [Watase had shot the ceiling to intimidate the man.]
249: 3301| [47] [Watase]
250: 3304| [45] ["I don't have all day to chat with you. Give me a hard time again and it won't be a warning shot next time."]
251: 3309| [47] [Eriguchi]
252: 3312| [45] ["..."]
253: 3317| [45] [Watase ignored the looks of fear that had risen to the men's faces and spoke to Dojima and Hiyama.]
254: 3325| [47] [Watase]
255: 3328| [45] ["Dojima, Hiyama, use their eyes to perform the retinal scan."]
256: 3336| [47] [Watase]
257: 3339| [45] ["If they give you any lip, then simply take their eyes... got it?"]
258: 3344| [45] [Watase ordered Dojima and Hiyama in the most intimidating manner he could think of.]
259: 3384| [47] [Dojima]
260: 3387| [45] ["Roger. They probably don't even need to be attached to open the door anyway."]
261: 3392| [47] [Hiyama]
262: 3395| [45] ["All right guys, haul your asses over here!"]
263: 3400| [47] [Eriguchi]
264: 3403| [45] ["St-stop it! What are you doing!?"]
265: 3408| [47] [Kashiwagi]
266: 3411| [45] ["At least... at least give us some AD! If you don't, we'll--"]
267: 3435| [47] [Hiyama]
268: 3438| [45] ["Quit wasting time already! Do you -want- us to shoot you!?"]
269: 3443| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama restrained the struggling researchers and forced them to complete the retinal authentication.]
270: 3507| [47] [Eriguchi]
271: 3510| [45] ["STOOOOOOOOP!!"]
272: 3515| [45] [At the same time the researcher let out that scream--]
273: 3563| [45] [The door to Subject N's room opened.]
274: 3615| [45] [At that moment, a refreshing and soothing "floral scent" wafted through the air.]
275: 3620| [45] [It was as if they'd opened the doors to a flowerbed--]
276: 3625| [47] [Watase]
277: 3626| [45] [(What...!?)]
278: 3631| [45] [But what they found on the other side--]
279: 3636| [45] [--was, of course, no flowerbed.]
280: 3750| [47] [Watase]
281: 3753| [45] ["... Wha..."]
282: 3758| [45] [Watase was once again at a loss for words.]
283: 3763| [47] [Dojima]
284: 3766| [45] ["What... the... hell...!?"]
285: 3771| [45] [It was such a bizarre sight.]
286: 3776| [45] [In the middle of that floral scented room filled with tons of stuffed animals...]
287: 3781| [45] [Was a girl hanging from the ceiling.]
288: 3786| [45] [She was bound hand to foot like some sort of feral beast.]
289: 3791| [45] [The floral scent was being emitted by an aromatic air freshener lying in the corner of the room.]
290: 3796| [45] [The girl, intoxicated by that scent, stared off blankly into space.]
291: 3805| [47] [Watase]
292: 3808| [45] ["Is this girl... Subject N...!?"]
293: 3813| [45] [--Watase called out to the girl again.]
294: 3821| [47] [Watase]
295: 3824| [45] ["H-hey...?"]
296: 3869| [45] [The girl looked at Watase in response.]
297: 3889| [45] [But Watase felt his body temperature drop the moment he looked into her hollow eyes.]
298: 3894| [45] [Dull eyes that had lost all emotion.]
299: 3899| [45] [The fear he felt was as if he had gazed into a forbidden abyss--]
300: 3908| [47] [Watase]
301: 3911| [45] ["What... in God's name is this!?"]
302: 3916| [47] [Hiyama]
303: 3919| [45] ["What in the hell did you bastards do to this girl!?"]
304: 3924| [47] [Eriguchi]
305: 3925| [45] ["..."]
306: 3933| [47] [Watase]
307: 3936| [45] ["The silent treatment, huh... Fine, be that way!"]
308: 3944| [47] [Watase]
309: 3947| [45] ["Dojima, keep an eye on them! Hiyama, help me get her out of these restraints!"]
310: 3952| [47] [Dojima & Hiyama]
311: 3955| [45] ["Y-yeah!"]
312: 3960| [45] [Dojima and Hiyama came back to their senses and sprung into action.]
313: 3978| [45] [Dojima pushed the researchers against the walls outside the room.]
314: 3983| [45] [He then fixed the door's opening in a way so that it wouldn't close again.]
315: 4041| [45] [In the meantime, Watase and Hiyama tried releasing the girl from her restraints.]
316: 4047| [45] [It took some effort, but they succeeded in removing the girl's bindings.]
317: 4117| [47] [Watase]
318: 4120| [45] ["... Are you okay?"]
319: 4125| [47] [Girl]
320: 4126| [45] ["..."]
321: 4131| [45] [Watase and Hiyama took Subject N out of her room.]
322: 4136| [45] [But she showed no reaction at all.]
323: 4141| [45] [In fact, it was like she didn't even realize anyone was speaking to her.]
324: 4146| [47] [Watase]
325: 4147| [45] [(Has her mind... broken?)]
326: 4152| [47] [Watase]
327: 4153| [45] [(Don't tell me it was due to all the human experimentation they put her through!?)]
328: 4158| [45] [Intense rage filled Watase's heart.]
329: 4163| [45] [No matter the circumstances, this was no way no treat such a frail girl!]
330: 4199| [47] [Watase]
331: 4202| [45] ["Hey, listen up, you bastards! We're taking this girl with us!"]
332: 4210| [47] [Watase]
333: 4213| [45] ["Once the world learns about her, you sons of bitches are done for! Face the truth of your sins as the law sees fit to punish you!"]
334: 4218| [47] [Eriguchi]
335: 4219| [45] ["..."]
336: 4224| [45] [But the researchers didn't respond.]
337: 4229| [45] [They were muttering something in a faint voice.]
338: 4234| [47] [Eriguchi]
339: 4237| [45] ["Done for... -we're- done for, huh... Everything will be done for... Thanks to you..."]
340: 4242| [47] [Kashiwagi]
341: 4245| [45] ["It's too late... without AD, we're..."]
342: 4250| [47] [Eriguchi]
343: 4253| [45] ["A rescue... You dare to call this a rescue when you don't even know a damn thing...?"]
344: 4258| [47] [Watase]
345: 4259| [45] [(... What's with these guys?)]
346: 4266| [45] [Something felt off to Watase. The researchers were acting weird.]
347: 4296| [47] [Dojima]
348: 4299| [45] ["... Hey? Are you listening!?"]
349: 4304| [45] [Dojima walked over to the researchers with the gun in his hand--]
350: 4309| [47] [Eriguchi]
351: 4312| [45] ["--You damned fools! You don't know just how terrifying N is!!"]
352: 4382| [45] [One of the researchers became enraged and lunged at Dojima.]
353: 4387| [47] [Dojima]
354: 4390| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
355: 4430| [45] [Dojima frantically tried to counterattack.]
356: 4476| [45] [But the researcher grabbed his arm and tried to steal his gun.]
357: 4484| [47] [Watase]
358: 4487| [45] ["Stop it! What are you doing!?"]
359: 4492| [47] [Eriguchi]
360: 4495| [45] ["What are -you- doing!? You call this a rescue!? You hypocrites! You really think you're in the right!?"]
361: 4500| [47] [Eriguchi]
362: 4503| [45] ["Give me the gun! If she's going to escape to the outside world, then I'd rather end this right here and now--!!"]
363: 4508| [47] [Dojima]
364: 4511| [45] ["S-stop it! Look out!!"]
365: 4516| [45] [Just as Dojima shouted that--]
366: 4593| [45] [The sound of a gunshot rang out.]
367: 4598| [47] [Eriguchi]
368: 4601| [45] ["Kah..."]
369: 4612| [45] [Blood spouted out of the hole in the researcher's chest, who then pitched forward and fell to the floor.]
370: 4673| [45] [The spurts of blood that scattered out of him stained Dojima's clothes.]
371: 4681| [47] [Watase]
372: 4684| [45] ["... Ah..."]
373: 4689| [45] [Everyone in the room stood rooted in place as if they were frozen.]
374: 4694| [45] [Eventually, the other researcher broke the silence with a shrill scream.]
375: 4699| [47] [Kashiwagi]
376: 4702| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAH! He's dead! You killed him! Murderer!! Murderer!!"]
377: 4726| [47] [Dojima]
378: 4729| [45] ["N-no! That was an accident--!"]
379: 4734| [47] [Kashiwagi]
380: 4737| [45] ["What rescue worker kills someone!? This is revenge for Eriguchi! Die with him!"]
381: 4783| [47] [Dojima]
382: 4786| [45] ["Stop-- ghh!"]
383: 4797| [45] [The researcher sprung at Dojima and strangled him while he was still standing.]
384: 4802| [45] [Watase watched that scene, dumbfounded.]
385: 4854| [47] [Watase]
386: 4855| [45] [(Wh-what's going on... What's up with these guys...!?)]
387: 4860| [47] [Watase]
388: 4861| [45] [(Why'd they change so suddenly!?)]
389: 4866| [47] [Watase]
390: 4867| [45] [(Wait... could the effects of the "malice" have already taken hold of them!? In this short amount of time--!?)]
391: 4872| [45] [His confused thoughts were interrupted by Dojima's pained cries.]
392: 4877| [47] [Dojima]
393: 4880| [45] ["Kah... haah... Kasasagi... Hiyama... he... lp..."]
394: 4885| [47] [Hiyama]
395: 4888| [45] ["!!"]
396: 4927| [45] [Hiyama gasped and took out his gun.]
397: 4957| [47] [Hiyama]
398: 4960| [45] ["Let go of Mr. Dojima!!"]
399: 4965| [45] [But when he issued that threat--]
400: 4970| [45] [The researcher turned right around towards Hiyama and lunged for him.]
401: 5010| [47] [Hiyama]
402: 5013| [45] ["!!"]
403: 5018| [45] [Hiyama's body shuddered at that moment,]
404: 5095| [45] [and another gunshot echoed.]
405: 5100| [47] [Kashiwagi]
406: 5103| [45] ["..."]
407: 5108| [47] [Hiyama]
408: 5111| [45] ["Ah..."]
409: 5211| [45] [--A small hole had bored itself near the researcher's throat.]
410: 5216| [47] [Kashiwagi]
411: 5219| [45] ["Y-you bastards have..."]
412: 5224| [47] [Kashiwagi]
413: 5227| [45] ["... Urgh!"]
414: 5333| [45] [The researcher tried to say something, but vomited up a small pool of blood before he could finish.]
415: 5360| [45] [And with that, he collapsed onto the floor with a thud.]
416: 5459| [45] [He then looked up to the ceiling with hollow eyes and faintly muttered to himself.]
417: 5464| [47] [Kashiwagi]
418: 5467| [45] ["... Our... noble goal..."]
419: 5472| [47] [Kashiwagi]
420: 5475| [45] ["... The monster... must not..."]
421: 5480| [47] [Kashiwagi]
422: 5481| [45] ["..."]
423: 5486| [45] [The researcher muttered those last incomprehensible words, then lost his strength.]
424: 5491| [45] [Hiyama was muttering to himself in shock.]
425: 5527| [47] [Hiyama]
426: 5530| [45] ["Huh... huh? I... I... killed him...?"]
427: 5538| [47] [Watase]
428: 5541| [45] ["C... calm down, Hiyama...!"]
429: 5549| [47] [Watase]
430: 5552| [45] ["We don't know for sure that he's dead...!"]
431: 5585| [45] [Watase ran over to the researchers and performed CPR.]
432: 5590| [45] [But their life signs grew weaker with each passing moment.]
433: 5595| [45] [Being a certified first-aid practitioner, Watase could tell right away-- that they were beyond help.]
434: 5603| [47] [Watase]
435: 5606| [45] ["... It's no use... They're already..."]
436: 5611| [45] [Watase muttered this as his shoulders slumped.]
437: 5665| [47] [Dojima]
438: 5668| [45] ["No way..."]
439: 5673| [47] [Hiyama]
440: 5676| [45] ["Goddammit... why did this have to happen...!?"]
441: 5681| [45] [Hiyama sounded like he was on the verge of tears.]
442: 5686| [45] [Watase also felt on the verge of collapse from his guilt, but then--]
443: 5704| [47] [Watase]
444: 5707| [45] ["Don't grieve. Now's not the time for regrets."]
445: 5715| [47] [Watase]
446: 5718| [45] ["Our mission... isn't over yet."]
447: 5723| [45] [They couldn't stay here.]
448: 5728| [45] [The WX particle energy levels in Area N were probably rising at that very moment. They really didn't have any time.]
449: 5733| [45] [Watase looked to Subject N as he thought that,]
450: 5741| [47] [Watase]
451: 5744| [45] ["...!"]
452: 5767| [45] [and was shocked to discover her looking at the researchers' bodies with a faint smile on her face.]
453: 5772| [45] [--Had she really hated those researchers that much?--]
454: 5808| [47] [Watase]
455: 5811| [45] ["N-no, more importantly... we need to hurry and get this girl out of here."]
456: 5819| [47] [Watase]
457: 5822| [45] ["Oh right, and we... we mustn't forget to plant the bomb."]
458: 5827| [47] [Dojima]
459: 5830| [45] ["R... right."]
460: 5897| [45] [The three of them planted the tetryl bomb in Subject N's room, then took her with them and left.]
461: 5951| [45] [They carried the bloodstained bodies of the researchers to the elevator to perform the retinal authentication.]
462: 5956| [45] [He was worried that the retina of someone half dead wouldn't work, but the elevator operated without any issues.]
463: 5964| [47] [Watase]
464: 5967| [45] ["Should we... take these guys up with us?"]
465: 5972| [47] [Dojima]
466: 5975| [45] ["... Let's not. They're already beyond help..."]
467: 5980| [45] [Watase nodded with depression in his heart.]
468: 5985| [45] [Their supposedly foolproof plan had already begun to fall completely apart--]
