  1:    8| [47] [Watase]
  2:   11| [45] ["... What's up, Teach? You're worrying about your students again, aren't you?"]
  3:   43| [47] [Ena]
  4:   46| [45] ["Huh...?"]
  5:   54| [47] [Watase]
  6:   57| [45] ["It'll be fine. That surveillance camera footage showed that there's a big chance they're in either Area 5 or 6."]
  7:   65| [47] [Watase]
  8:   68| [45] ["They shouldn't have gotten caught up in the fire in this area."]
  9:   73| [45] [Watase said that knowing he was trying to convince himself of that as much as he was trying to convince Ena.]
 10:   78| [45] [He was doing his best to avoid bringing up that Ena had seen one of her students in this very area almost an hour ago.]
 11:   83| [45] [But Ena still looked glum.]
 12:  109| [47] [Ena]
 13:  112| [45] ["... The fire's not all I'm worried about."]
 14:  120| [47] [Watase]
 15:  123| [45] ["Huh?"]
 16:  131| [47] [Ena]
 17:  134| [45] ["I'm more concerned about the radiation..."]
 18:  160| [47] [Ena]
 19:  163| [45] ["I mean, your Procyon said that the radiation levels here are over 5000 mSv, right?"]
 20:  171| [47] [Watase]
 21:  174| [45] ["R-right."]
 22:  200| [47] [Ena]
 23:  203| [45] ["It doesn't feel that way at all... but still, this level of radiation would normally kill you, right?"]
 24:  211| [47] [Ena]
 25:  214| [45] ["We don't even know if the AD is actually protecting us from this level..."]
 26:  219| [47] [Watase]
 27:  220| [45] ["..."]
 28:  225| [45] [The first danger standard was "4000-8000 mSv", which referred to an area that they wouldn't want to stay for long in even with AD.]
 29:  233| [47] [Watase]
 30:  236| [45] ["... Yeah, it'd be best for both the survivors -and- us not to overstay our welcome here."]
 31:  262| [47] [Ena]
 32:  265| [45] ["Indeed. Especially me and Ms. Tachibana..."]
 33:  273| [47] [Watase]
 34:  276| [45] ["Huh? Tachibana I get, but why you?"]
 35:  302| [47] [Ena]
 36:  305| [45] ["Don't you remember?"]
 37:  313| [47] [Ena]
 38:  316| [45] ["I didn't take any AD until you guys found me."]
 39:  324| [47] [Watase]
 40:  327| [45] ["!!"]
 41:  332| [45] [Watase was filled with shock.]
 42:  337| [45] [Now that he thought about it, she was absolutely right. Ena hadn't even known about the meltdown until the group had told her.]
 43:  363| [47] [Ena]
 44:  366| [45] ["The Procyon's reading was still low then, so I don't think my cumulative exposure is all that high..."]
 45:  374| [47] [Watase]
 46:  377| [45] ["N-no, hold on! You say that, but you can never be too careful in this situation!"]
 47:  385| [47] [Watase]
 48:  388| [45] ["You should tell Tachibana and sit out the search of this area or--"]
 49:  414| [47] [Ena]
 50:  417| [45] ["Oh my, don't kid yourself. There's no way I can just rest while everyone else is working as hard as they can."]
 51:  425| [47] [Watase]
 52:  428| [45] ["..."]
 53:  433| [45] [Watase took a long hard look at Ena's face.]
 54:  438| [45] [He'd only thought of her as a naggy woman, but--]
 55:  446| [47] [Watase]
 56:  449| [45] ["... You're amazing, Teach..."]
 57:  475| [47] [Ena]
 58:  478| [45] ["Huh? How so?"]
 59:  486| [47] [Watase]
 60:  489| [45] ["How do I put it... 'you've got a heart of steel' or something...? Anyway, you're an amazing woman."]
 61:  515| [47] [Ena]
 62:  518| [45] ["Heh, don't tell me you're falling for me?"]
 63:  526| [47] [Watase]
 64:  529| [45] ["A little."]
 65:  555| [47] [Ena]
 66:  558| [45] ["..."]
 67:  563| [45] [Ena completely went quiet in a second.]
 68:  589| [47] [Ena]
 69:  592| [45] ["... Wait a minute, this isn't the time for jokes, right? You -do- know what we're dealing with right now, don't you?"]
 70:  600| [47] [Watase]
 71:  603| [45] ["Oh? I was just playing along with your joke. Weren't you?"]
 72:  629| [47] [Ena]
 73:  632| [45] ["Oh, uh, right... Anyway, got it, I'll be careful about my health."]
 74:  637| [45] [Ena looked away when she said that.]
 75:  663| [47] [Ena]
 76:  666| [45] ["Let's cut the silly chit-chat and get back to searching."]
 77:  674| [47] [Watase]
 78:  677| [45] ["R-right."]
 79:  682| [45] [Watase nodded after a bit of thinking, then focused on the search.]
 80:  727| [45] [He and Ena finished searching the hallway and headed on over to the elevator hall.]
