  1:   60| [45] [--Area 3, inner ring, B1.]
  2:   65| [45] [There were no signs of a fire there.]
  3:   70| [45] [The Procyon reading was only "1792 mSv", so it posed no threat on that front either.]
  4:   78| [47] [Watase]
  5:   81| [45] ["It looks like this floor is safe... for now, anyway."]
  6:  143| [47] [Ukita]
  7:  146| [45] ["Then shall we split into two teams and search like we did last time?"]
  8:  173| [47] [Ena]
  9:  176| [45] ["It takes up too much precious time to decide on teams each time. Let's just get to searching right away."]
 10:  204| [47] [Jun]
 11:  207| [45] ["Yeah, especially seeing as we haven't found even a hint of any AD."]
 12:  323| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  324| [45] ["..."]
 14:  332| [47] [Kazami]
 15:  335| [45] ["Then we'll take the outer ring, while Moribe's team will cover the inner ring."]
 16:  340| [45] [No one offered any objections.]
 17:  345| [45] [Like last time, they split into teams of "Watase/Kazami/Yuuri" and "Jun/Ukita/Ena", and began their search of Area 3, B1.]
 18:  388| [45] [--First, Watase headed towards the outer ring with Kazami and Yuuri.]
 19:  432| [45] [But when they tried to open the security gate in the connecting passageway that led to the outer ring--]
 20:  446| [47] [Watase]
 21:  449| [45] ["Huh?"]
 22:  454| [45] [--it refused to accept the card.]
 23:  459| [45] [It was a Level 3 gate, so a Level 4 card should have been more than enough to open it.]
 24:  464| [45] [But even after they put the card in the slot again,]
 25:  475| [45] [the door still wouldn't open.]
 26:  483| [47] [Watase]
 27:  486| [45] ["Dammit, the thing must be busted! Are there any other ways in?"]
 28:  514| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  517| [45] ["I'll go check!"]
 30:  522| [45] [Kazami said this and took out the map she'd drawn earlier.]
 31:  640| [47] [Kazami]
 32:  643| [45] ["--We are currently located here. And this door won't open..."]
 33:  706| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  709| [45] ["What's more... the security slot in the passage on the Area 2 side was burned down in the fire, so that won't work either."]
 35:  717| [47] [Watase]
 36:  720| [45] ["Now that I think about it, this staircase collapsed too, so we can't get in there from another staircase, can we."]
 37:  746| [47] [Kazami]
 38:  749| [45] ["Which means that our only choice is to enter from the Area 4 side, though it'll mean taking a detour."]
 39:  768| [47] [Watase]
 40:  771| [45] ["Things just keep getting worse and worse... and we're no closer to finding any AD."]
 41:  776| [45] [They only had 10 minutes left until the effects of their last AD shot wore off.]
 42:  784| [47] [Watase]
 43:  787| [45] ["If only we had one more..."]
 44:  792| [45] [A shy voice spoke up after Watase had muttered this.]
 45:  835| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  838| [45] ["U-um..."]
 47:  846| [47] [Watase]
 48:  849| [45] ["Hmm? What's wrong?"]
 49:  857| [47] [Yuuri]
 50:  860| [45] ["If it comes down to it... then why don't I just pass on taking any... so that everyone else will be fine...?"]
 51:  886| [47] [Kazami]
 52:  889| [45] ["What are you saying, Ms. Yuuri!? We could never let you do something like that!"]
 53:  950| [47] [Yuuri]
 54:  953| [45] ["!"]
 55:  958| [45] [Yuuri trembled with a start.]
 56:  966| [47] [Watase]
 57:  969| [45] ["She's right! If something like that happens, then -I- will--"]
 58:  995| [47] [Kazami]
 59:  998| [45] ["No, let's not worry about that until we're out of time for sure."]
 60: 1006| [47] [Watase]
 61: 1009| [45] ["Y-yeah, you're right..."]
 62: 1017| [47] [Kazami]
 63: 1020| [45] ["Anyway, let's get back to the inner ring stat. We're short on time."]
 64: 1046| [47] [Yuuri]
 65: 1049| [45] ["O-okay..."]
 66: 1054| [45] [Kazami quickly started walking off, followed closely by Watase and Yuuri.]
 67: 1059| [45] [But Watase felt something was off about Yuuri.]
 68: 1064| [47] [Watase]
 69: 1065| [45] [(What is it about her that's so strange...?)]
 70: 1070| [45] [She was by no means being uncooperative with the search.]
 71: 1075| [45] [True, she was very scared, but there was also a kind part of her that tried to put others before herself, like he'd seen just now.]
 72: 1080| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1081| [45] [(So then... why'd she try to run off by herself?)]
 74: 1152| [45] [He remembered the look Yuuri had given him when they'd first seen each other.]
 75: 1157| [45] [She had definitely been afraid when she saw him.]
 76: 1162| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1163| [45] [(Could it be that she's still scared of me? But if that's the case, then why...?)]
 78: 1198| [45] [But just as Watase thought this--]
 79: 1203| [47] [???]
 80: 1206| [45] ["AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"]
 81: 1250| [45] [He heard an ear-piecing scream.]
 82: 1258| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1261| [45] ["What was that!?"]
 84: 1269| [47] [Yuuri]
 85: 1272| [45] ["W-wasn't that Ms. Jun and the others!?"]
 86: 1277| [45] [Yuuri was speaking in a loud voice for the first time in what seemed like ages.]
 87: 1303| [47] [Kazami]
 88: 1306| [45] ["--Let's go!"]
 89: 1326| [45] [Kazami broke off into a fierce dash without a moment's hesitation.]
 90: 1331| [45] [Watase took Yuuri by the hand and followed suit.]
 91: 1379| [45] [They turned a corner to find Jun and the others backing out of a room.]
 92: 1441| [47] [Jun]
 93: 1444| [45] ["C... Captain!"]
 94: 1452| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1455| [45] ["W-what's wrong!? Did something happen!?"]
 96: 1509| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1512| [45] ["Aah!? Y-yes..."]
 98: 1517| [45] [Ukita in particular seemed quite shaken up, as he started muttering nigh-incomprehensibly upon seeing Watase and the others.]
 99: 1544| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1547| [45] ["Everyone, please calm down! Exactly what is it that happened!?"]
101: 1552| [45] [It was then that Ena mumbled in dazed shock, her face pale.]
102: 1578| [47] [Ena]
103: 1581| [45] ["... Bodies..."]
104: 1589| [47] [Watase]
105: 1592| [45] ["Huh?"]
106: 1618| [47] [Ena]
107: 1621| [45] ["So many... bodies...!"]
108: 1626| [45] [--All the air in the hallway froze at that moment.]
109: 1634| [47] [Watase]
110: 1637| [45] ["D-did you say... bodies...?"]
111: 1663| [47] [Ena]
112: 1666| [45] ["They're in that room..."]
113: 1692| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1695| [45] ["Were they... victims of the fire?"]
115: 1703| [47] [Watase]
116: 1706| [45] ["!!"]
117: 1711| [45] [The image of Natsuhiko and the others, their bodies horribly charred, passed through Watase's mind for a moment.]
118: 1716| [45] [But Jun shook her head.]
119: 1742| [47] [Jun]
120: 1745| [45] ["No... it'd make a lot more sense if they -were-, though...!"]
121: 1753| [47] [Watase]
122: 1756| [45] ["Wh-what do you mean...?"]
123: 1782| [47] [Jun]
124: 1785| [45] ["... You'll understand if you go in there and see for yourself..."]
125: 1790| [45] [Jun looked to the nearby door with a confounded look on her face.]
126: 1850| [45] [The door was already shut--]
127: 1855| [45] [--but they could still smell what appeared to be rust coming from it.]
128: 1860| [47] [Watase]
129: 1861| [45] [(What's that stench...?)]
130: 1866| [45] [No sooner had the thought crossed Watase's mind than he was gripped by an inexplicable feeling of terror.]
131: 1871| [45] [He took a big gulp and prepared himself.]
132: 1879| [47] [Watase]
133: 1882| [45] ["... I think it'd be best if you stayed back here, Yuuri."]
134: 1915| [47] [Yuuri]
135: 1918| [45] ["O-okay...!"]
136: 1932| [45] [Yuuri nodded with a frozen look on her face.]
137: 1989| [47] [Jun]
138: 1992| [45] ["Captain, Lieutenant, you ready...?"]
139: 2000| [47] [Kazami]
140: 2003| [45] ["Y-yes."]
141: 2011| [47] [Watase]
142: 2014| [45] ["Yeah..."]
143: 2019| [45] [Jun walked up to the room--]
144: 2024| [45] [And opened the door.]
145: 2217| [47] [Watase]
146: 2220| [45] ["!?"]
147: 2225| [45] [The first thing that flooded into his eyes was red.]
148: 2230| [45] [The room was dyed with the color of blood.]
149: 2235| [45] [Lying close by Watase's feet in that pool of blood were two crumpled bodies.]
150: 2240| [45] [And-- there was one more body deeper in the room.]
151: 2245| [45] [A body wearing the same kind of radiation protection suit that Kazami and Jun had shown him earlier.]
152: 2250| [45] [The second she saw it-- Kazami shouted.]
153: 2258| [47] [Kazami]
154: 2261| [45] ["I-it can't be...!?"]
155: 2269| [47] [Kazami]
156: 2272| [45] ["That's... that body is...!!"]
157: 2277| [45] [Jun nodded with a look of grief on her face and answered.]
158: 2285| [47] [Jun]
159: 2288| [45] ["Yeah... that's Dojima."]
160: 2293| [45] [Watase gasped at those words.]
161: 2298| [45] [Though he didn't remember the name, the fact that -Jun- did meant--]
162: 2306| [47] [Watase]
163: 2309| [45] ["Don't tell me... was that man... one of our...!?"]
164: 2317| [47] [Kazami]
165: 2320| [45] ["Yes... he was a member of Team A, just like us...!"]
166: 2328| [47] [Jun]
167: 2331| [45] ["Why... why did this have to happen...?"]
168: 2336| [45] [Kazami and Jun fell to their knees right then and there.]
169: 2341| [47] [Watase]
170: 2342| [45] [(Wh-what the hell is this...!?)]
171: 2347| [45] [Watase had expected that any "bodies" he would find in this facility would be those who had burned to death.]
172: 2352| [45] [But that clearly wasn't the case here.]
173: 2357| [45] [These corpses had lost their lives at the hands of others--]
174: 2362| [45] [Yes. They had clearly been murdered.]
175: 2370| [47] [Watase]
176: 2373| [45] ["Wh-what the hell..."]
177: 2381| [47] [Watase]
178: 2384| [45] ["... happened here...!?"]
179: 2389| [45] [No one answered that question.]
180: 2394| [45] [Watase just stood frozen in a daze in that room filled with the stench of blood.]
181: 2440| [45] [--People had been trapped in a facility with a melted down nuclear reactor--]
182: 2445| [45] [He'd thought that was the worst things could get.]
183: 2450| [45] [They were already in a hell where a moment's distraction could lead to death...]
184: 2495| [45] [But perhaps fire and radiation were not the only threats to the group's lives out there.]
185: 2500| [45] [There were 8 more hours until the lockdown was lifted.]
186: 2505| [45] [The life-and-death drama they were all a part of had only just begun...]
