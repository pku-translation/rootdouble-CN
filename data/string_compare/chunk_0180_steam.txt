  0:   40| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 5]
  1:  106| [45] [--The morning bell rang as Natsuhiko and Salyu entered the classroom.]
  2:  114| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  117| [45] ["Whew, looks like we made it..."]
  4:  143| [47] [Salyu]
  5:  146| [45] ["Mmm...? Mashiro's not here."]
  6:  154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  157| [45] ["Ah, you're right..."]
  8:  162| [45] [Now that he got a good look, Mashiro's seat was empty. He couldn't even see her bag nearby.]
  9:  170| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  173| [45] ["... Guess she's taking the day off. Maybe she caught a cold..."]
 11:  206| [45] [Natsuhiko said as he sat in his seat.]
 12:  211| [45] [Eventually Ena entered the classroom.]
 13:  292| [47] [Ena]
 14:  295| [45] ["Okay. Good morning class. Let me take roll."]
 15:  321| [47] [Ena]
 16:  324| [45] ["Akagawa."]
 17:  329| [47] [Male Student 1]
 18:  332| [45] ["Here."]
 19:  340| [47] [Ena]
 20:  343| [45] ["Ino."]
 21:  348| [47] [Female Student 1]
 22:  351| [45] ["Heeere."]
 23:  359| [47] [Ena]
 24:  362| [45] ["Oda--"]
 25:  367| [45] [And thus, roll call commenced.]
 26:  500| [45] [But as she eventually got to Natsuhiko's name--]
 27:  508| [47] [Ena]
 28:  511| [45] ["--Tenkawa."]
 29:  519| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  522| [45] ["Here."]
 31:  530| [47] [Ena]
 32:  533| [45] ["Toba."]
 33:  559| [47] [Ena]
 34:  562| [45] ["... Ms. Toba? Huh? Is Ms. Toba taking today off?"]
 35:  588| [47] [Ena]
 36:  591| [45] ["That's odd... She didn't contact us beforehand."]
 37:  599| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  602| [45] ["Huh?"]
 39:  607| [45] [That could only mean that Mashiro was in a rush and skipped school without permission.]
 40:  612| [45] [Even though she was not usually the type to be truant.]
 41:  617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  618| [45] [(... Don't tell me...?)]
 43:  745| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  748| [45] ["S-so... We're the only ones who've noticed this, aren't we?"]
 45:  774| [47] [Mashiro]
 46:  777| [45] ["So in that case, we gotta thwart the terrorism ourselves!"]
 47:  883| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  884| [45] [(That idiot. Don't tell me she actually plans to try and stop a terrorist plot...!)]
 49:  889| [45] [But judging by how Mashiro was yesterday, that did indeed seem plausible.]
 50:  894| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51:  895| [45] [(... I don't know on what basis she believes there's an actual terrorist plot, but whatever it is,%Nit's definitely not a problem that a mere high schooler can solve.)]
 52:  900| [45] [In fact, Mashiro's actions could cause some sort of danger. That was the vague premonition he was getting.]
 53:  905| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  906| [45] [(I guess I'll go look for her after school...)]
 55:  951| [45] [Afterwards, Natsuhiko continued his classes somewhat absentmindedly.]
 56:  956| [45] [And as lunch break began--]
 57:  961| [45] [There was still no sign of Mashiro.]
