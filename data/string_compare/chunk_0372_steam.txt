  1:   63| [45] [--Natsuhiko's group waited in the surveillance room for Kazami to arrive.]
  2:   68| [45] [Nobody said a word. Silence filled the room.]
  3:   73| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:   74| [45] [(Will Ms. Tachibana come...!?)]
  5:   79| [45] [Natsuhiko and Ena stood closer to the door to protect Yuuri and Mashiro.]
  6:   84| [45] [Ena held her gun behind her back, leaving no holes in her vigilance.]
  7:   89| [45] [Natsuhiko left the gun he got from Ukita slung in his belt.]
  8:  100| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  101| [45] [(Hopefully I won't have to use this thing, though...!)]
 10:  106| [45] [As soon as Natsuhiko had that thought,]
 11:  113| [45] [the heavy silence was shattered.]
 12:  164| [45] [The door to the room opened and Kazami appeared.]
 13:  218| [47] [Kazami]
 14:  221| [45] ["... It's been a while, hasn't it, Tenkawa?"]
 15:  226| [45] [Kazami looked at Natsuhiko with dull eyes.]
 16:  231| [45] [She didn't bring Subject N with her. She must've put her down somewhere.]
 17:  239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  242| [45] ["... Thanks for coming."]
 19:  268| [47] [Kazami]
 20:  271| [45] ["Something about your announcement piqued my interest."]
 21:  279| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  282| [45] ["Watase and I have had our minds warped by BC, you say?"]
 23:  290| [47] [Kazami]
 24:  293| [45] ["And you say you can 'bring me back to normal'? What is the meaning of that?"]
 25:  301| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  304| [45] ["... I'll explain it briefly."]
 27:  337| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 28:  340| [45] ["First off, Yuuri and I are high level Communicators."]
 29:  348| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  351| [45] ["Our abilities are 'telepathy', 'empathy', ..."]
 31:  359| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  362| [45] ["... and a third ability, which synchronizes human minds and allows for memory manipulation: Senses Sympathy."]
 33:  397| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  400| [45] ["You're saying such an ability exists?"]
 35:  408| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  411| [45] ["It's an ability that's unknown to the general public. Communicators that can use it are also extremely rare."]
 37:  419| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  422| [45] ["It's not just us who can use it. 'Subject N'--"]
 39:  430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  433| [45] ["--the girl you call 'Nagisa'-- was able to use it too."]
 41:  456| [47] [Kazami]
 42:  457| [45] ["..."]
 43:  514| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  517| [45] ["She too was a high level Communicator."]
 45:  572| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  575| [45] ["But as a side effect of the experiments, her mind was contaminated with unimaginable malice."]
 47:  630| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  633| [45] ["Through BC, that malice propagated to the people who came in contact with her--%NThey lost mental stability and began attacking others."]
 49:  651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  654| [45] ["That's the truth of the incident that happened here."]
 51:  677| [47] [Kazami]
 52:  678| [45] ["..."]
 53:  683| [45] [Kazami silently looked on with doubt and hostility in her eyes.]
 54:  709| [47] [Kazami]
 55:  712| [45] ["So what are you suggesting you'll do to me...?"]
 56:  720| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  723| [45] ["... We'll erase the malice from your mind as well."]
 58:  728| [45] [Natsuhiko tensely answered.]
 59:  733| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 60:  734| [45] [(She's the last one, so I'll do it carefully... I'll look in every nook and cranny of Ms. Tachibana's mind and erase all of the malice.)]
 61:  739| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 62:  740| [45] [(We don't have much time left, so we can't afford any failures...!)]
 63:  808| [45] [But confronting the Subject N within Kazami would mean coming in contact with the test subject for the fourth time.]
 64:  813| [45] [Each confrontation with her whittled down his mind. There was no guarantee he could withstand another one.]
 65:  878| [45] [But as that thought crossed his mind, he received telepathy from Yuuri.]
 66:  946| [47] [Yuuri]
 67:  949| [45] [{Hikorin, are you okay...?}]
 68:  973| [47] [Yuuri]
 69:  976| [45] [{If you think you've reached your limit, then I'll go instead--}]
 70:  984| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  987| [45] [{... No, Yuuri. I'm grateful for the sentiment, but let's not.}]
 72:  995| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73:  998| [45] [{If you get infected with Subject N's malice, then maybe not even I could stop you. It'd be the end of everything at that point.}]
 74: 1022| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1025| [45] [{...!}]
 76: 1033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 77: 1036| [45] [{We can't let that happen, right? So please continue what you've been doing and take care of covering for me.}]
 78: 1060| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1063| [45] [{O... okay.}]
 80: 1068| [45] [Yuuri nodded and grabbed Natsuhiko's hand.]
 81: 1073| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1074| [45] [(It'll be okay... We've come so far already...)]
 83: 1167| [45] [But when he stepped up to Kazami, she stepped back as if in fear.]
 84: 1175| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1178| [45] ["Please, don't be frightened. We just want to bring you back to normal."]
 86: 1204| [47] [Kazami]
 87: 1207| [45] ["I see..."]
 88: 1233| [47] [Kazami]
 89: 1236| [45] ["... So you'll do that... regardless of whether I want it or not, won't you?"]
 90: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1247| [45] ["... Yes."]
 92: 1274| [47] [Yuuri]
 93: 1277| [45] ["Because we want to gather everyone and escape together..."]
 94: 1373| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri said that as they reached their hands out to Kazami's forehead.]
 95: 1378| [45] [Mashiro and Ena gulped as they watched the two of them unite their minds--]
 96: 1438| [45] [And dive into Kazami's memory.]
 97: 1705| [85] [Malice-corrupted memories have been purified.]
