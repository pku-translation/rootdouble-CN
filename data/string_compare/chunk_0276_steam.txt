  1:   63| [45] [--Natsuhiko heard Watase destroy the password keypad on the other side of the door.]
  2:   92| [45] [He then took a deep breath. Right after that, Yuuri quietly spoke to him.]
  3:  118| [47] [Yuuri]
  4:  121| [45] ["Hikorin, Captain Kasasagi really is our ally, huh..."]
  5:  129| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  6:  132| [45] ["Yeah, Mashiro should be safe now."]
  7:  137| [45] [Natsuhiko looked Yuuri in the face as he spoke.]
  8:  145| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  148| [45] ["But anyway... you really are Yuuri, aren't you?"]
 10:  153| [45] [He still couldn't believe she was alive.]
 11:  158| [45] [But now that Watase was gone, he felt he had to make sure again.]
 12:  163| [45] [She smiled and answered him.]
 13:  189| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  192| [45] ["Yeah... It's me, Hikorin."]
 15:  200| [47] [Yuuri]
 16:  203| [45] ["I'm no phantom, nor an impostor. I'm the real Yuuri Kotono...!"]
 17:  208| [45] [Her voice, her looks, her expressions, and mannerisms were all the same as the Yuuri he knew.]
 18:  260| [45] [Yuuri held his hand and continued.]
 19:  286| [47] [Yuuri]
 20:  289| [45] ["... See, Hikorin? You can feel me, can't you?"]
 21:  297| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  300| [45] ["... Yeah."]
 23:  308| [47] [Yuuri]
 24:  311| [45] ["A hallucination wouldn't have human warmth, right?"]
 25:  319| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  322| [45] ["Right."]
 27:  327| [45] [He could feel her warmth through her small hand.]
 28:  332| [45] [And finally, Natsuhiko was convinced.]
 29:  337| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  338| [45] [(... She's real...)]
 31:  343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  344| [45] [(Yuuri's alive...!)]
 33:  349| [45] [And with that thought in mind, Natsuhiko felt his whole face break out into a smile.]
 34:  356| [45] [--But he couldn't stay happy for long.]
 35:  361| [45] [Natsuhiko vocalized the questions that he could by no means ignore.]
 36:  369| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  372| [45] ["I... I know it might be odd for me to ask this, but..."]
 38:  380| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  383| [45] ["Well... how are you alive?"]
 40:  444| [47] [Yuuri]
 41:  447| [45] ["!"]
 42:  470| [45] [Yuuri's face froze as soon as that last word left Natsuhiko's lips.]
 43:  537| [45] [The memories he recalled just a few hours ago when he found those documents in his mother's office--]
 44:  542| [45] [They were so fresh in his mind and seemed to be the true reality.]
 45:  547| [45] [And it wasn't just his memory. According to Mashiro's memory, Yuuri had died nine years as well.]
 46:  552| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't think of a way to reconcile the contradictions.]
 47:  602| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  605| [45] ["... I thought you died here nine years ago? What's the deal with that?"]
 49:  610| [47] [Yuuri]
 50:  611| [45] ["..."]
 51:  637| [47] [Yuuri]
 52:  640| [45] ["That's--..."]
 53:  645| [45] [After a moment of severe hesitation, Yuuri quietly answered.]
 54:  653| [47] [Yuuri]
 55:  656| [45] ["... Actually, that was a lie fabricated by LABO."]
 56:  664| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57:  667| [45] ["--Huh?"]
 58:  693| [47] [Yuuri]
 59:  696| [45] ["Nine years ago, LABO announced to the world that 'Yuuri Kotono died as a result of the LABO fire'."]
 60:  704| [47] [Yuuri]
 61:  707| [45] ["They lied to you, and Mashiron... and my parents, the school, and the media too."]
 62:  715| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63:  718| [45] ["What...? Why would they do that!?"]
 64:  744| [47] [Yuuri]
 65:  747| [45] ["That's because this facility's been founded upon countless such lies, you see."]
 66:  755| [47] [Yuuri]
 67:  758| [45] ["A facility coated with lies everywhere-- that's what LABO is."]
 68:  763| [45] [Natsuhiko was puzzled by her words.]
 69:  771| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70:  774| [45] ["A facility coated with lies...? What do you mean?"]
 71:  800| [47] [Yuuri]
 72:  803| [45] ["I'll start with the biggest lie..."]
 73:  811| [47] [Yuuri]
 74:  814| [45] ["You may have already realized this, but-- this isn't even a nuclear power research facility to begin with. It's a BC research facility."]
 75:  822| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76:  825| [45] ["I knew it...!"]
 77:  830| [45] [Natsuhiko had already guessed that.]
 78:  835| [45] [But that affirmation only raised more questions.]
 79:  843| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80:  846| [45] ["But the entire city believes that LABO is a nuclear research facility, right? So why would they make that lie?"]
 81:  872| [47] [Yuuri]
 82:  875| [45] ["Because it's more convenient that everyone thinks that way."]
 83:  901| [47] [Yuuri]
 84:  904| [45] ["If they have the excuse that they're dealing with a nuclear reactor--"]
 85:  912| [47] [Yuuri]
 86:  915| [45] ["--nobody would question why their security is so strict, or why they're so strangely thorough with their information management, would they?"]
 87:  923| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88:  926| [45] ["True... I never questioned it either."]
 89:  952| [47] [Yuuri]
 90:  955| [45] ["So in other words, it was all a front. To hide what LABO was doing behind the scenes."]
 91:  963| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92:  966| [45] ["... So that's it."]
 93:  971| [45] [It would only be obvious for a nuclear power research facility to be secretive about its research.]
 94:  976| [45] [So using that false identity as a front would indeed be suitable for hiding something.]
 95:  981| [45] [However--]
 96:  989| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97:  992| [45] ["... But in that case..."]
 98: 1000| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1003| [45] ["What exactly is LABO hiding?"]
100: 1008| [45] [Natsuhiko posed that question out to Yuuri.]
101: 1016| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1019| [45] ["Does this facility really have a secret they'd need to go to such lengths to hide?"]
103: 1027| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1030| [45] ["The reason they falsified your death has something to do with it too, doesn't it?"]
105: 1056| [47] [Yuuri]
106: 1059| [45] ["... Yes."]
107: 1067| [47] [Natsuhiko]
108: 1070| [45] ["Please Yuuri, tell me. What happened nine years ago?"]
109: 1078| [47] [Natsuhiko]
110: 1081| [45] ["What happened to you after that fire? What have you been doing and where have you been all this time?"]
111: 1107| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1110| [45] ["..."]
113: 1118| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1121| [45] ["... Is it something you can't tell me?"]
115: 1147| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1150| [45] ["N-no! Not at all, but--"]
117: 1158| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1161| [45] ["... It's too hard to explain in just a few words."]
119: 1169| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1172| [45] ["Huh?"]
121: 1198| [47] [Yuuri]
122: 1201| [45] ["It'll take a long time to tell you everything and I'm not confident I can put it in words... so..."]
123: 1207| [45] [Yuuri grasped Natsuhiko's hand and continued.]
124: 1233| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1236| [45] ["Dive into my mind and see it with your own eyes."]
126: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
127: 1247| [45] ["Huh?"]
128: 1255| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1258| [45] ["You can dive into people's memories by now, right? So if you use that ability to see my memories, you'll understand everything."]
130: 1266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 1269| [45] ["But won't it take a long time to go through nine whole years of memories...?"]
132: 1295| [47] [Yuuri]
133: 1298| [45] ["It'll be fine. When you watch people's memories, almost no time passes at all in the real world."]
134: 1303| [45] [Now that she mentioned it, when he saw Mashiro's memories, he looked through them fairly leisurely compared to how little time actually passed.]
135: 1308| [45] [In that case, it certainly would be faster to watch Yuuri's memories firsthand rather than talk it out.]
136: 1313| [45] [Besides-- Natsuhiko himself wanted to know the detailed truth as soon as possible.]
137: 1321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1324| [45] ["... Are you sure, Yuuri? Are you really okay with me peeking into your mind...?"]
139: 1350| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1353| [45] ["If it's you, then yes..."]
141: 1379| [47] [Yuuri]
142: 1382| [45] ["I'm sure it'll be an uncomfortable truth and you might start hating me for it..."]
143: 1408| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1411| [45] ["... But I want you to know everything that I've experienced."]
145: 1434| [45] [Yuuri softly shut her eyes. Her hands trembled slightly.]
146: 1439| [45] [--Natsuhiko didn't get why she was so afraid.]
147: 1444| [45] [He didn't understand what she meant by "you might start hating me for it".]
148: 1449| [45] [But he steeled himself.]
149: 1454| [45] [He swore that no matter what he learned, he would not let it agitate him.]
150: 1462| [47] [Natsuhiko]
151: 1465| [45] ["... Okay, I'm ready now."]
152: 1520| [47] [Yuuri]
153: 1523| [45] ["Go ahead."]
154: 1577| [45] [Natsuhiko grasped her hand tightly and focused his mind.]
155: 1688| [45] [--Just then.]
156: 1693| [45] [His sight was engulfed in darkness.]
157: 1698| [45] [It was the same phenomenon that happened when he had dived into Mashiro's mind.]
158: 1854| [45] [Countless "visions" floated in the darkness.]
159: 1859| [47] [Natsuhiko]
160: 1860| [45] [(These are Yuuri's memories...!)]
161: 1865| [45] [These were the memories of various scenes she had experienced in the past.]
162: 1870| [45] [Natsuhiko gently peeked into the oldest memory...]
