  2:   90| [47] [[--Memories with Yuuri Kotono--]]
  3:  170| [45] [--One day, about a year after the incident--]
  4:  175| [45] [The children returned to Rokumei City, their long life in seclusion over.]
  5:  293| [45] [Dr. Tenkawa took the four of them by car to somewhere a small distance away from the house.]
  6:  298| [45] [She was being cautious on the off chance that anyone shady was lurking just around the corner.]
  7:  331| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  334| [45] ["... Okay, looks like there aren't any suspicious characters around."]
  9:  339| [45] [The professor spoke as she surveyed her surroundings.]
 10:  365| [47] [Miyoko]
 11:  368| [45] ["Okay, everyone. Let's go."]
 12:  382| [47] [All 4]
 13:  385| [45] ["Yes ma'am."]
 14:  390| [45] [The kids were happy to finally be back in their hometown.]
 15:  395| [45] [After a short walk, they saw the house that they hadn't seen in a year.]
 16:  422| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  425| [45] ["The Tenkawa residence... Everything about it is so nostalgic..."]
 18:  452| [47] [Salyu]
 19:  455| [45] ["Mm. I was only here a short week, but this house really is the place I belong."]
 20:  463| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  466| [45] ["But still, it's already been a whole year, huh."]
 22:  493| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  496| [45] ["I know what you mean~ It went by so quickly, didn't it?"]
 24:  522| [47] [Miyoko]
 25:  525| [45] ["What were your thoughts on the past year, everyone?"]
 26:  533| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  536| [45] ["Well, it was fun. I got Salyu to teach me, so it was like a fun training camp every day."]
 28:  562| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  565| [45] ["Thanks to her, I'm even good with all my weak subjects too. Though it doesn't really matter since I'm already set for my career."]
 30:  591| [47] [Salyu]
 31:  594| [45] ["I was also able to further polish my martial arts technique with ESP Bureau staff."]
 32:  620| [47] [Miyoko]
 33:  623| [45] ["Looks like you've all achieved your own results, then. How about you, Yuuri?"]
 34:  649| [47] [Mashiro]
 35:  652| [45] ["Oh yeah, Yuuri. You seemed to have kept to your room lately..."]
 36:  678| [47] [Yuuri]
 37:  681| [45] ["Hm? Teehee... Actually, I finally achieved my own results as well."]
 38:  707| [47] [Yuuri]
 39:  710| [45] ["Hikorin, Mashiron, Salyu, Professor. These are presents from me."]
 40:  717| [45] [Yuuri reached into her bag and took out--]
 41:  811| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  814| [45] ["Scarves?"]
 43:  849| [47] [Yuuri]
 44:  852| [45] ["I finished knitting enough for everyone yesterday."]
 45:  860| [47] [Yuuri]
 46:  863| [45] ["I knitted some in LABO too, but they all burned up in the explosion."]
 47:  871| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  874| [45] ["Ah, now that you mention it..."]
 49:  941| [45] [The phantom Yuuri had been knitting scarves.]
 50:  946| [45] [Perhaps that was because the real Yuuri had been knitting scarves as well.]
 51: 1000| [47] [Yuuri]
 52: 1003| [45] ["I was planning on having the professor pass the scarves on to you guys after I completed them. So after two years, my wish is finally complete."]
 53: 1011| [47] [Yuuri]
 54: 1014| [45] ["Too bad I didn't make it in time for Tanabata, though."]
 55: 1022| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56: 1025| [45] ["Tanabata? What use would scarves be in the summer..."]
 57: 1033| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58: 1036| [45] ["... Ah."]
 59: 1041| [45] [Once Natsuhiko caught Yuuri's implication, he looked up to the sky.]
 60: 1090| [45] [Stars spread out on the whole sky overhead.]
 61: 1095| [45] [It was the same sky he looked up at 11 years ago.]
 62: 1142| [45] [Seeing the stars reminded Natsuhiko of that night.]
 63: 1207| [45] [--The night where he took Yuuri and ran from home as a child.]
 64: 1212| [45] [As the professor took them home, Natsuhiko and Yuuri looked up at the stars.]
 65: 1261| [45] [At Orihime and Hikoboshi, separated by the Heavenly River.]
 66: 1266| [45] [Those stars seemed to symbolize Yuuri and Natsuhiko...]
 67: 1271| [45] [As Natsuhiko realized his own powerlessness, Yuuri smiled and said,]
 68: 1337| [47] [Yuuri]
 69: 1340| [45] ["You see, even if those two stars are separated, they can meet each other once a year."]
 70: 1366| [47] [Yuuri]
 71: 1369| [45] ["And because they've made that promise, they're not sad."]
 72: 1477| [45] [--Afterwards, they would be separated for real.]
 73: 1482| [45] [And Yuuri would wait in that dark underground facility for her once-a-year rendezvous with Natsuhiko.]
 74: 1487| [45] [Unaware of that future, he looked to her and said,]
 75: 1538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1541| [45] ["... Hey, Yuuri."]
 77: 1549| [47] [Yuuri]
 78: 1552| [45] ["Huh?"]
 79: 1560| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1563| [45] ["I'll never forget what happened today."]
 81: 1571| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1574| [45] ["I'll never forget looking at the stars with you."]
 83: 1618| [45] [As he looked at her, he silently swore.]
 84: 1623| [45] [--To one day go up to her.]
 85: 1628| [45] [And protect her forever.]
 86: 1633| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1634| [45] [(Once I grow up and get stronger...)]
 88: 1639| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 89: 1640| [45] [(I swear I'll protect you, Yuuri...!)]
 90: 1689| [45] [--Natsuhiko finally fulfilled the oath he swore that night.]
 91: 1694| [45] [He finally saved Yuuri and brought her back home to this house.]
 92: 1738| [45] [Natsuhiko took the hand knit scarf from Yuuri and said,]
 93: 1746| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1749| [45] ["Welcome home, Yuuri."]
 95: 1796| [47] [Yuuri]
 96: 1799| [45] ["It's great to be back!"]
 97: 1804| [45] [She answered with a bright smile.]
 98: 1809| [45] [A smile outshining Orihime, the weaving princess in the night sky.]
