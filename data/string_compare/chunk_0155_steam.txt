  1:  131| [45] [When Mashiro and Natsuhiko entered the classroom with Salyu, it stirred a commotion among their classmates.]
  2:  136| [47] [Male Student 1]
  3:  139| [45] ["Huh? Tenkawa, why are you with Toba -and- Ms. Sannomiya today?"]
  4:  147| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  150| [45] ["Ah, nah, we just happened to get here at the same time."]
  6:  173| [45] [Natsuhiko's grandiose answer prompted a chuckle and a whisper from Mashiro.]
  7:  288| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  291| [45] ["Wow, smooth save there, Mr. Natsuhiko."]
  9:  299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  302| [45] ["You sure seem calm about it... We can't say anything unnecessary here."]
 11:  409| [47] [Salyu]
 12:  412| [45] ["Unnecessary?"]
 13:  420| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 14:  423| [45] ["... Like how we're living together."]
 15:  449| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  452| [45] ["Well, I guess it'll help the three of us get along if we make this our little secret~"]
 17:  511| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  512| [45] [(Our little secret, huh...)]
 19:  517| [45] [Indeed, living together meant that it'd be best that they get along at least a little bit.]
 20:  522| [45] [However, Natsuhiko didn't think sharing a "little" secret was the best way to achieve that goal.]
 21:  541| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  544| [45] ["Sure, I guess it's best to leave it a secret between the three of us for the time being so we can avoid any misunderstandings."]
 23:  570| [47] [Mashiro]
 24:  573| [45] ["Okay. Good, good. This is kinda exciting."]
 25:  599| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  602| [45] ["Mm."]
 27:  607| [45] [Salyu nodded at Mashiro's words.]
 28:  697| [45] [Natsuhiko sighed a little as he made it to his desk.]
 29:  709| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  712| [45] ["Get along? With Salyu?"]
 31:  738| [47] [Mashiro]
 32:  741| [45] ["What? Got a problem with that?"]
 33:  749| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  752| [45] ["I don't really have a problem, but..."]
 35:  757| [45] [To be honest, he didn't want to imagine a future like that.]
 36:  983| [45] [He glanced at Salyu to see her making a troubled expression.]
 37:  988| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  989| [45] ["..."]
 39:  994| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  995| [45] ["..."]
 41: 1115| [47] [Mashiro]
 42: 1118| [45] ["... Good grief. I thought we talked this all out yesterday..."]
 43: 1123| [45] [Mashiro shrugged her shoulders in exasperation.]
 44: 1233| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu sighed as they made it to their desks.]
 45: 1358| [45] [--The first lesson of that day was Parapsychology.]
 46: 1451| [47] [Ena]
 47: 1454| [45] ["Now then, today we'll review yesterday's field trip."]
 48: 1480| [47] [Ena]
 49: 1483| [45] ["We learned a lot of things we usually don't touch upon during regular classes, didn't we?"]
 50: 1509| [47] [Ena]
 51: 1512| [45] ["So, what did you all learn? Care to start, hmm... Mr. Natsuhiko Tenkawa?"]
 52: 1566| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53: 1569| [45] ["Huh?"]
 54: 1601| [45] [A devilish smile formed on Ena's face when she saw Natsuhiko's surprise to hear his name called out so suddenly.]
 55: 1606| [45] [It appeared to be payback for him spacing out yesterday.]
 56: 1657| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 57: 1658| [45] [(But you were so nice yesterday... you're so mean, Professor.)]
 58: 1666| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1669| [45] ["Y-yeah... like how about that 'link between the brain and BC' that the staff member mentioned?"]
 60: 1704| [47] [Ena]
 61: 1707| [45] ["Exactly. Research in the fields of BC and brain physiology are closely related."]
 62: 1712| [45] [Ena tapped on her own head as she spoke.]
 63: 1738| [47] [Ena]
 64: 1741| [45] ["In short, BC is direct brain-to-brain communication."]
 65: 1767| [47] [Ena]
 66: 1770| [45] ["It incites stimuli in a third party's brain cells, causing the secretion of neurotransmitters."]
 67: 1821| [45] [Other students began to raise their voices at those words.]
 68: 1826| [47] [Male Student 1]
 69: 1829| [45] ["Huh!? THAT'S how it works?"]
 70: 1863| [47] [Ena]
 71: 1866| [45] ["Oh, I'm sure we've gone over that in class. Well, you don't necessarily need to know the underlying principles in order to use BC, but there's no harm in learning, is there?"]
 72: 1892| [47] [Ena]
 73: 1895| [45] ["In layman's terms..."]
 74: 1921| [47] [Ena]
 75: 1924| [45] ["Telepathy stimulates the parts of the brain responsible for hearing to produce 'the same response as if it were actually hearing it'."]
 76: 1932| [47] [Ena]
 77: 1935| [45] ["Conversely, empathy works by catching thoughts that leak from other people's brains and interpreting them as spoken words."]
 78: 2022| [47] [Mashiro]
 79: 2025| [45] ["So either way, they're both kinds of hallucinations?"]
 80: 2033| [47] [Mashiro]
 81: 2036| [45] ["I mean, it does sound like actual sounds, but what really happens is that the information is directly conveyed to the brain, so..."]
 82: 2088| [47] [Ena]
 83: 2091| [45] ["True. But since it's the brain 'perceiving' the information, that might already make it a hallucination to begin with."]
 84: 2143| [47] [Mashiro]
 85: 2146| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean?"]
 86: 2198| [47] [Ena]
 87: 2201| [45] ["Hmm, let's see..."]
 88: 2228| [47] [Ena]
 89: 2231| [45] ["Do you all know what 'blind spots' are?"]
 90: 2239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 2242| [45] ["Blind spots? I have heard of them, but..."]
 92: 2250| [47] [Ena]
 93: 2253| [45] ["Humans lack photoreceptors on the retina where the optic nerve passes through it."]
 94: 2279| [47] [Ena]
 95: 2282| [45] ["You actually 'don't see anything' there."]
 96: 2290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 2293| [45] ["...? You mean there's a blank spot in the middle of our vision?"]
 98: 2298| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't quite follow what Ena was saying.]
 99: 2324| [47] [Ena]
100: 2327| [45] ["I guess it is a little hard to explain in words. So instead, I'll send you a figure so you can experience it firsthand."]
101: 2385| [45] [Ena fiddled with the computer to send image data to the students' tablet PCs.]
102: 2555| [45] [It was an image with just two black dots.]
103: 2563| [47] [Ena]
104: 2566| [45] ["Okay, so close your right eye and use your left eye to look at the dot on the right."]
105: 2574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 2577| [45] ["...?"]
107: 2582| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at the dot as instructed.]
108: 2590| [47] [Ena]
109: 2593| [45] ["And then slowly move your face closer to the screen."]
110: 2601| [47] [Ena]
111: 2604| [45] ["Once you're about 15 cm away, what happens...?"]
112: 2612| [47] [Natsuhiko]
113: 2615| [45] ["Ah!"]
114: 2620| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't help but exclaim.]
115: 2625| [45] [The dot that he could've sworn was there had disappeared.]
116: 2716| [45] [The other students appeared to have the same reaction, and the classroom broke into a commotion.]
117: 2802| [47] [Ena]
118: 2805| [45] ["Understand what happened, class? The black dot entered the left eye's 'dead spot'."]
119: 2831| [47] [Ena]
120: 2834| [45] ["The dead spot is a 'place where the eye cannot see', or in other words, an 'empty space'."]
121: 2842| [47] [Ena]
122: 2845| [45] ["Humans cannot see anything inside those dead spots."]
123: 2853| [47] [Natsuhiko]
124: 2856| [45] ["I see..."]
125: 2943| [47] [Mashiro]
126: 2946| [45] ["But... that's kind of strange... How can we have a hole in our vision without normally being aware of it?"]
127: 2998| [47] [Ena]
128: 3001| [45] ["It is strange, isn't it? That's because the brain automatically fills in the gap."]
129: 3009| [47] [Mashiro]
130: 3012| [45] ["It fills in the gap...?"]
131: 3038| [47] [Ena]
132: 3041| [45] ["Okay, next, I'll send you an image to demonstrate how that works."]
133: 3099| [45] [And with that, Ena sent the students another image.]
134: 3269| [45] [It was a figure with a black line with a break on one side and a dot on the other.]
135: 3277| [47] [Ena]
136: 3280| [45] ["Same thing as last time. Close your right eye and use your left eye to look at the dot..."]
137: 3285| [45] [As instructed, Natsuhiko closed his right eye and brought his face closer to the image.]
138: 3290| [45] [And when he did--]
139: 3298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 3301| [45] ["Huh?"]
141: 3306| [45] [Natsuhiko was surprised once again.]
142: 3311| [45] [Now the broken line appeared to be smooth and continuous.]
143: 3414| [47] [Ena]
144: 3417| [45] ["Interesting, isn't it?"]
145: 3425| [47] [Ena]
146: 3428| [45] ["This is what I meant when I said the brain automatically fills the gap."]
147: 3454| [47] [Ena]
148: 3457| [45] ["Because of your blind spot, you can't see the part where the line is broken..."]
149: 3465| [47] [Ena]
150: 3468| [45] ["But your brain functions automatically to fill in that gap."]
151: 3494| [47] [Ena]
152: 3497| [45] ["Furthermore, this is always happening. Even when you're just looking at your environment normally."]
153: 3551| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 3554| [45] ["Haah~..."]
155: 3559| [45] [Natsuhiko finally realized.]
156: 3610| [47] [Natsuhiko]
157: 3611| [45] [(So the reason the line looked continuous was because that's how my brain filled in the gap, huh...)]
158: 3616| [45] [In other words, the brain apparently assumed that "the line wouldn't suddenly just break there; it's obviously continuous".]
159: 3621| [45] [And in the same way, the brain is "continuously" or "automatically" filling in the dead spots--]
160: 3626| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 3627| [45] [(So that's why we're never consciously aware of our dead spots in everyday life.)]
162: 3690| [47] [Ena]
163: 3693| [45] ["Understand, class? This is what I meant when I said that things the brain perceives are hallucinations to begin with."]
164: 3719| [47] [Ena]
165: 3722| [45] ["What lies before our eyes isn't exactly seen the way it actually is..."]
166: 3748| [47] [Ena]
167: 3751| [45] ["Everything, without exception, is filtered by the brain before we perceive it."]
168: 3759| [47] [Ena]
169: 3762| [45] ["What we see isn't everything, and everything we see isn't necessarily real."]
170: 3813| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 3814| [45] [(So maybe everything she's saying is a hallucination as well...)]
172: 3819| [45] [But it might've been a bit of a stretch to say that. Natsuhiko chuckled to himself.]
173: 3853| [47] [Ena]
174: 3856| [45] ["So, do you now understand that when humans perceive their world, it has to be through their brain as a necessity?"]
175: 3882| [47] [Ena]
176: 3885| [45] ["BC, as you all know, is communication directly influencing the brain."]
177: 3893| [47] [Ena]
178: 3896| [45] ["Theoretically, that influence isn't limited to the sense of hearing... Perhaps it's not limited to just telepathy and empathy, either."]
179: 3922| [47] [Ena]
180: 3925| [45] ["If visual-influencing telepathy exists, then perhaps taste-reading empathy could exist as well."]
181: 3933| [47] [Ena]
182: 3936| [45] ["Perhaps one can even convey the entire world one perceives to someone else."]
183: 3962| [47] [Ena]
184: 3965| [45] ["The possibilities of BC are endless. So keep training every day until you can open up a new path yourselves."]
185: 3991| [47] [Ena]
186: 3994| [45] ["Who knows? One day you may find a third ability beyond that of telepathy or empathy."]
187: 4046| [45] [Ena springboarded off that note to begin the actual lesson.]
188: 4051| [45] [The connection between the brain and BC, the parts of the brain that perceive BC, the theoretical mechanisms--]
189: 4063| [45] [She reached a good stopping point right as the bell rang...]
