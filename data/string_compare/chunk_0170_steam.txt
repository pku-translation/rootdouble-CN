  1:   70| [45] [Class ended and thus lunch break began--]
  2:   75| [45] [Natsuhiko left the classroom and made the arduous journey through the whirlpool of telepathy.]
  3:  129| [85] [{U-umm... Ms. Munakata.]
  4:  131| [85] [ I gave it a lot of thought,]
  5:  133| [85] [ and finally made up my mind.}]

  7:  145| [86] [{U-umm... Ms. Munakata. I gave it a lot of thought, and finally made up my mind.}]
  8:  156| [85] [ {... Huh?}]
  9:  167| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 10:  168| [86] [{... Huh?}]
 11:  180| [85] [{All things considered...]
 12:  182| [85] [ I've decided that I really do need]
 13:  184| [85] [ to talk to you face-to-face after all.}]

 15:  201| [86] [{All things considered... I've decided that I really do need to talk to you face-to-face after all.}]

 17:  208| [85] [ after school...?}]
 18:  219| [86] [Youthful Boy]
 19:  220| [86] [{Will you come to the roof after school...?}]
 20:  228| [85] [{... Okay.]
 21:  230| [85] [ That's all I ask for.}]
 22:  241| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 23:  242| [86] [{... Okay. That's all I ask for.}]
 24:  250| [85] [{You've conveyed your feelings]
 25:  252| [85] [ well enough through telepathy,]
 26:  254| [85] [ so there might]
 27:  256| [85] [ not be much left]
 28:  258| [85] [ to talk about...}]
 29:  274| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 30:  275| [86] [{You've conveyed your feelings well enough through telepathy, so there might not be much left to talk about...}]
 31:  280| [85] [{But still, we really do need]
 32:  282| [85] [ to meet face-to-face.}]
 33:  293| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 34:  294| [86] [{But still, we really do need to meet face-to-face.}]
 35:  304| [85] [{... Yeah.}]
 36:  315| [86] [Youthful Boy]
 37:  316| [86] [{... Yeah.}]
 38:  327| [85] [{Now that the whole school]
 39:  329| [85] [ knows about our situation,]
 40:  331| [85] [ there's nothing left]
 41:  333| [85] [ to fear at all.}]
 42:  349| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 43:  350| [86] [{Now that the whole school knows about our situation, there's nothing left to fear at all.}]
 44:  355| [85] [{I promise I'll come]

 48:  371| [86] [{I promise I'll come to the roof for you, so don't you dare run away.}]
 49:  379| [85] [{Well, whether I say okay or not]
 50:  381| [85] [ is a different story.]
 51:  383| [85] [ I look forward to seeing you]
 52:  385| [85] [ after school. Bye.}]
 53:  396| [86] [Ms. Munakata]
 54:  397| [86] [{Well, whether I say okay or not is a different story. I look forward to seeing you after school. Bye.}]
 55:  411| [85] [{O-okay!}]
 56:  427| [86] [Youthful Boy]
 57:  428| [86] [{O-okay!}]
 58:  433| [85] [{Wow,]
 59:  435| [85] [ how bittersweet...}]
 60:  446| [86] [Pitcher]
 61:  447| [86] [{Wow, how bittersweet...}]
 62:  452| [85] [ {That's youth for you...}]
 63:  463| [86] [Catcher]
 64:  464| [86] [ {That's youth for you...}]
 65:  475| [85] [{Why are we even bothering with baseball at a time like this...?}]
 66:  486| [86] [Batter]
 67:  487| [86] [{Why are we even bothering with baseball at a time like this...?}]
 68:  499| [85] [{... Man, Benizaki.]
 69:  501| [85] [ I guess we're still]
 70:  503| [85] [ incapable of]
 71:  505| [85] [ directional telepathy...}]
 72:  516| [86] [Calm Boy]
 73:  517| [86] [{... Man, Benizaki. I guess we're still incapable of directional telepathy...}]
 74:  528| [85] [{Yeah...]
 75:  530| [85] [ What do you wanna do, Shin?]
 76:  532| [85] [ I'm completely open]
 77:  534| [85] [ after school.}]
 78:  550| [86] [Stupid Boy]
 79:  551| [86] [{Yeah... What do you wanna do, Shin? I'm completely open after school.}]
 80:  558| [85] [{Looks like there's gonna be a love confession on the roof. Wanna go mess with 'em?}]
 81:  569| [86] [Calm Boy]
 82:  570| [86] [{Looks like there's gonna be a love confession on the roof. Wanna go mess with 'em?}]
 83:  578| [85] [{Hey, you idiot!]
 84:  580| [85] [ Don't you dare]

 87:  594| [86] [{Hey, you idiot! Don't you dare get in the way of love!}]
 88:  602| [85] [{I was joking.]
 89:  604| [85] [ Well, might as well]
 90:  606| [85] [  do something.]
 91:  608| [85] [ So why don't we help]
 92:  610| [85] [ so he can confess calmly?}]

 94:  622| [86] [{I was joking. Well, might as well do something. So why don't we help so he can confess calmly?}]

 99:  651| [85] [{That sounds good...]
100:  653| [85] [ wait, why are we]
101:  655| [85] [ still talking about this]
102:  657| [85] [ with telepathy?}]
103:  668| [86] [Stupid Boy]
104:  669| [86] [{That sounds good... wait, why are we still talking about this with telepathy?}]
105:  676| [85] [{Ah... crap. Looks like it's]

124:  797| [85] [{That's not even]
125:  799| [85] [ your song!}]
126:  810| [86] [Audience Member 1]
127:  811| [86] [{That's not even your song!}]
128:  819| [85] [{Try to play]
129:  821| [85] [ an original song for once!}]
130:  832| [86] [Audience Member 2]
131:  833| [86] [{Try to play an original song for once!}]
132:  841| [85] [{Your band name]
133:  843| [85] [ sucks!}]
134:  854| [86] [Audience Member 3]
135:  855| [86] [{Your band name sucks!}]
136:  869| [85] [{B-but I think]
137:  871| [85] [ it's a good name...!}]
138:  888| [86] [Vocalist]
139:  889| [86] [{B-but I think it's a good name...!}]
140:  903| [45] [Natsuhiko ignored the commotion in his head and muttered.]
141:  911| [47] [Natsuhiko]
142:  914| [45] ["Geez. Another complete waste of time today..."]
143:  955| [47] [Salyu]
144:  958| [45] ["Agreed."]
145:  984| [47] [Mashiro]
146:  987| [45] ["Now, now. Slow and steady wins the race."]
147:  995| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148:  998| [45] ["Does it, now...? Well, I do admit that last part of the discussion was kind of interesting."]
149: 1003| [45] [When Natsuhiko shrugged his shoulders, Salyu tugged at his sleeve and implored him.]
150: 1029| [47] [Salyu]
151: 1032| [45] ["More importantly, let's eat already. We don't have infinite lunch time."]
152: 1058| [47] [Mashiro]
153: 1061| [45] ["True. How about we all eat together on top of the roof?"]
154: 1069| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 1072| [45] ["Then let's go buy food first."]
156: 1077| [45] [The three of them made their way.]
157: 1178| [45] [They stocked up on baked goods and started heading for the roof.]
158: 1261| [45] [Natsuhiko bought a katsu sandwich and yakisoba bread. Mashiro bought a sandwich, donut, waffle, and pudding. As for Salyu--]
159: 1266| [45] [She bought seven varieties of bread in total.]
160: 1292| [47] [Mashiro]
161: 1295| [45] ["Salyu, you sure bought a lot, huh?"]
162: 1321| [47] [Salyu]
163: 1324| [45] ["... Because I wasn't sure which ones would taste good. So I wanted to try a variety."]
164: 1350| [47] [Salyu]
165: 1353| [45] ["I definitely did not give into gluttony. Just curious how they taste."]
166: 1379| [47] [Mashiro]
167: 1382| [45] ["Hmm? Well, okay. Let's leave it at that."]
168: 1387| [45] [Mashiro and Natsuhiko looked at each other and smiled wryly.]
169: 1392| [47] [Natsuhiko]
170: 1393| [45] [(That's obviously not the case since she kept saying how hungry she was a while ago.)]
171: 1398| [45] [Perhaps Salyu was ashamed of her own gluttony.]
172: 1424| [47] [Salyu]
173: 1427| [45] ["... But you're not one to talk, Mashiro. All you bought was tons of sweet looking foods."]
174: 1435| [47] [Natsuhiko]
175: 1438| [45] ["That's true. This girl here can eat a lot more than you'd expect."]
176: 1446| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 1449| [45] ["Would it have hurt to choose between either the donut or the waffle?"]
178: 1536| [47] [Mashiro]
179: 1539| [45] ["Don't worry. My body's built to not get fat no matter how much I eat."]
180: 1544| [45] [As they were having that conversation, they reached a turn in the hallway, when suddenly--]
181: 1603| [47] [Mashiro]
182: 1606| [45] ["Whagh!"]
183: 1681| [47] [???]
184: 1684| [45] ["Whoa there..."]
185: 1689| [45] [Mashiro ended up tumbling down.]
186: 1694| [45] [She apparently ran into a woman on the other side of the turn.]
187: 1702| [47] [Mashiro]
188: 1705| [45] ["Ow ow ow..."]
189: 1731| [47] [???]
190: 1734| [45] ["Oh boy. You okay?"]
191: 1739| [45] [The woman that bumped into Mashiro reached out her hand.]
192: 1765| [47] [???]
193: 1768| [45] ["My bad, my bad. I wasn't looking. Can you stand?"]
194: 1837| [47] [Mashiro]
195: 1840| [45] ["Ah, yes, I'm fine."]
196: 1866| [47] [Mashiro]
197: 1869| [45] ["I wasn't looking where I was going eith-- wait, huh?"]
198: 1874| [45] [Mashiro exclaimed in surprise as she got up.]
199: 1882| [47] [Mashiro]
200: 1885| [45] ["Aren't you...?"]
201: 1911| [47] [???]
202: 1914| [45] ["Hmm? Have we met somewhere?"]
203: 1922| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 1925| [45] ["Mashiro, do you know her?"]
205: 1951| [47] [Mashiro]
206: 1954| [45] ["We were all at the scene of that accident! Remember?"]
207: 1959| [45] [Those words jogged Natsuhiko's memory.]
208: 1967| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 1970| [45] ["Ah, so you must be...!"]
210: 2080| [45] [--The rescue worker that responded to the traffic accident three days ago.]
211: 2136| [47] [???]
212: 2139| [45] ["Relax. We're on the scene."]
213: 2144| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2145| [45] [(That's her...)]
215: 2240| [45] [Said rescue worker raised her voice as if she too had just remembered.]
216: 2266| [47] [???]
217: 2269| [45] ["Ah! You're the kids who reported that accident, aren't you?"]
218: 2295| [47] [Mashiro]
219: 2298| [45] ["Huh? You remember!? I'm touched!"]
220: 2324| [47] [???]
221: 2327| [45] ["Hmm? Touched?"]
222: 2353| [47] [Mashiro]
223: 2356| [45] ["The first time I saw your rescue work in action, I became an instant fan~!%NYou were so awesome!"]
224: 2382| [47] [???]
225: 2385| [45] ["Ahahah, it's not that big a deal. I was only assigned to the squad last month."]
226: 2393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
227: 2396| [45] ["Is that so?"]
228: 2422| [47] [Mashiro]
229: 2425| [45] ["But still, that's all the more awesome! Just a short time after you got assigned, you're already doing dramatic rescues!"]
230: 2430| [45] [The worker blushed as Mashiro showered her with praise.]
231: 2456| [47] [???]
232: 2459| [45] ["... Hahah. It's not like I do it for the praise, but I really do appreciate it."]
233: 2464| [45] [Seeing that smile gave Natsuhiko an impression.]
234: 2469| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 2470| [45] [(I see. Guess she genuinely likes helping people out...)]
236: 2475| [45] [He thought it made her a noble person, but it also made him feel like a commoner in comparison.]
237: 2480| [45] [But Mashiro on the other hand seemed to take a liking to her. She cheerfully introduced herself.]
238: 2567| [47] [Mashiro]
239: 2570| [45] ["Ah, I'm Mashiro Toba. And these are my friends--"]
240: 2578| [47] [Natsuhiko]
241: 2581| [45] ["Hi. I'm Natsuhiko Tenkawa."]
242: 2641| [47] [Salyu]
243: 2644| [45] ["... Louise Yui Sannomiya."]
244: 2681| [47] [???]
245: 2684| [45] ["Huh, oh, you're half-Japanese? Guess I should've expected the fabled Rokumei Academy to be international to boot."]
246: 2710| [47] [Jun]
247: 2713| [45] ["By the way, I'm Jun Moribe. Call me Jun."]
248: 2774| [47] [Mashiro]
249: 2777| [45] ["Okay. Nice to meet you, Jun!"]
250: 2785| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 2788| [45] ["Still, I didn't expect them to send in a rescue team for an accident like that."]
252: 2814| [47] [Mashiro]
253: 2817| [45] ["Yeah, you're right... Don't you usually mobilize for more large-scale disasters?"]
254: 2878| [47] [Jun]
255: 2881| [45] ["Well, thing is, we just happened to be deployed on a different case nearby that day.%NWe got contacted on our way back, so we rushed over there."]
256: 2907| [47] [Jun]
257: 2910| [45] ["Being on a rescue squad means going from mission to mission.%NIt ain't no cakewalk, that's for sure."]
258: 2918| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 2921| [45] ["Sounds tough..."]
260: 2947| [47] [Jun]
261: 2950| [45] ["Nah, but still, I'm doing this because I like it."]
262: 3011| [47] [Mashiro]
263: 3014| [45] ["But, Jun... what made you decide to enlist in a rescue squad to begin with?"]
264: 3040| [47] [Mashiro]
265: 3043| [45] ["I think it must be super tough for a girl to be a rescue squad member."]
266: 3104| [47] [Jun]
267: 3107| [45] ["Hmm~..."]
268: 3112| [45] [Jun pondered that question for a moment before answering.]
269: 3138| [47] [Jun]
270: 3141| [45] ["... Don't laugh, but..."]
271: 3167| [47] [Jun]
272: 3170| [45] ["I guess it's because I wanted to be a hero."]
273: 3224| [47] [Natsuhiko]
274: 3227| [45] ["A hero?"]
275: 3253| [47] [Jun]
276: 3256| [45] ["Yeah, I've always looked up to them ever since I was a kid~"]
277: 3261| [45] [Natsuhiko found himself intrigued by her words.]
278: 3266| [47] [Natsuhiko]
279: 3267| [45] [(Someone's actually living my childhood dream...?)]
280: 3272| [45] [Natsuhiko himself had wished to be that sort of person at one point.]
281: 3284| [45] [And so did Mashiro--]
282: 3346| [47] [Mashiro]
283: 3349| [45] ["I know exactly what you mean! When I was a kid, I too swore to myself that I would protect this town I so dearly love!"]
284: 3410| [47] [Jun]
285: 3413| [45] ["Ahahah, you've got promise, I'll tell ya that. Once you graduate from here, you should enlist in a firefighter academy."]
286: 3424| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 3427| [45] ["But that's kinda rare, isn't it? A girl wanting to become a hero instead of a heroine."]
288: 3453| [47] [Jun]
289: 3456| [45] ["Well, to be honest, ever since I was a kid, I've been something of a tomboy."]
290: 3464| [47] [Jun]
291: 3467| [45] ["I always wanted to be the 'hero' who saves people instead of the 'heroine' who needs to be saved."]
292: 3493| [47] [Jun]
293: 3496| [45] ["So I thought if I wanted to be a real-life hero, I guess a rescue worker would be the closest thing."]
294: 3522| [47] [Jun]
295: 3525| [45] ["It's kinda tough to define what exactly a hero is, but saving people's lives is pretty damn heroic, I'd say."]
296: 3586| [47] [Mashiro]
297: 3589| [45] ["Yeah, I think so too!"]
298: 3615| [47] [Mashiro]
299: 3618| [45] ["There's nothing more valuable than the treasure of life!"]
300: 3718| [47] [Jun]
301: 3721| [45] ["Oh, you're such a good girl~ There, there."]
302: 3726| [45] [Mashiro smiled as Jun patted her on the head.]
303: 3731| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 3732| [45] [(These two kinda seem like they're on the same wavelength...)]
305: 3737| [45] [If nothing else, both Jun and Mashiro seemed to enjoy helping people.]
306: 3742| [45] [As Natsuhiko pondered the similarity, Jun continued.]
307: 3768| [47] [Jun]
308: 3771| [45] ["Well, to be honest, pretty much everyone who joins Sirius is kinda like that, I guess?"]
309: 3797| [47] [Jun]
310: 3800| [45] ["The pay's low and the job's hard, and yet there's no end to those who want to join nonetheless."]
311: 3826| [47] [Mashiro]
312: 3829| [45] ["Now that I think about it, there was another female member, wasn't there?"]
313: 3855| [47] [Jun]
314: 3858| [45] ["Yeah, that's our lieutenant."]
315: 3884| [47] [Jun]
316: 3887| [45] ["And she's amazing! No matter how dangerous the situation is, she calmly leaps in and gets the job done flawlessly! She's a perfect woman!"]
317: 3913| [47] [Mashiro]
318: 3916| [45] ["Mmm! That's cool too...!"]
319: 3924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
320: 3927| [45] ["If the lieutenant's like that, then what's the captain like?"]
321: 3953| [47] [Jun]
322: 3956| [45] ["Oh, the captain? The captain's a little, uh~..."]
323: 3961| [45] [Jun made a slightly bitter face at that thought.]
324: 3987| [47] [Mashiro]
325: 3990| [45] ["A-a little what?"]
326: 3998| [47] [Natsuhiko]
327: 4001| [45] ["Wait... don't tell me there's something wrong with him?"]
328: 4027| [47] [Jun]
329: 4030| [45] ["Ah, no, not at all! He's a super elite too, but..."]
330: 4056| [47] [Jun]
331: 4059| [45] ["He's just a little bit -too- cool-headed for me. Kinda dry, too..."]
332: 4064| [45] [Even Natsuhiko and Mashiro could tell she was struggling to find the right words.]
333: 4069| [47] [Natsuhiko]
334: 4070| [45] [(Does his personality clash with Jun's, maybe...?)]
335: 4075| [45] [As soon as he pondered that possibility, Jun looked at her watch and spoke up.]
336: 4101| [47] [Jun]
337: 4104| [45] ["Whoa, would you look at the time."]
338: 4112| [47] [Natsuhiko]
339: 4115| [45] ["Oh, were you busy?"]
340: 4141| [47] [Jun]
341: 4144| [45] ["Actually, I came here here for work. To give some disaster prevention guidance, see."]
342: 4170| [47] [Mashiro]
343: 4173| [45] ["O-oh, is that so? I'm sorry for taking up your time!"]
344: 4249| [47] [Jun]
345: 4252| [45] ["Ah, no, it's okay, it's okay! I had fun talking with you guys."]
346: 4260| [47] [Jun]
347: 4263| [45] ["Welp, don't hesitate to call if something happens. Later~"]
348: 4332| [45] [And with that, Jun waved her hand and left.]
349: 4337| [45] [Mashiro muttered as she watched her leave.]
350: 4398| [47] [Mashiro]
351: 4401| [45] ["Haah~ she was sooo cool~!"]
352: 4413| [45] [Mashiro's face lit up in admiration.]
353: 4418| [45] [Natsuhiko reflected on the conversation Jun and Mashiro just had.]
354: 4423| [47] [Natsuhiko]
355: 4424| [45] [(... "There's nothing more valuable than the treasure of life", huh.)]
356: 4429| [47] [Natsuhiko]
357: 4430| [45] [(Now that I think about it, I might have said something like that long ago...)]
358: 4501| [45] [How long ago was the question.]
359: 4506| [45] [As if unlocked by the heat of the moment, another door in Natsuhiko's memories opened wide--]
360: 4513| [55] [âˆšBefore Chapter 4]
361: 4585| [45] [Natsuhiko remembered the serious expression on Mashiro's face back then.]
362: 4590| [45] [It didn't seem like Mashiro changed one bit since those days.]
363: 4595| [47] [Natsuhiko]
364: 4596| [45] [(Mashiro's grown and become more feminine in some regards, but I guess she's still the same as she always was...)]
365: 4601| [45] [She would abide by her own kindness at all costs. As long as her conscience told her to do so, she'd go through any danger at all.]
366: 4606| [45] [So perhaps it's only natural that she'd admire Jun so much for working hard and earnestly for that same goal even as an adult.]
367: 4611| [45] [As Natsuhiko reminisced, Salyu interrupted by tugging at his sleeve.]
368: 4689| [47] [Salyu]
369: 4692| [45] ["... Umm, guys."]
370: 4700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
371: 4703| [45] ["Hmm?"]
372: 4711| [47] [Salyu]
373: 4714| [45] ["Can we go now? Lunch break's going to end..."]
374: 4740| [47] [Mashiro]
375: 4743| [45] ["Huh? ... Oh."]
376: 4754| [45] [When he looked at his watch, Natsuhiko realized there were only 40 minutes left of lunch break.]
377: 4780| [47] [Mashiro]
378: 4783| [45] ["My bad, my bad. You must be hungry, right?"]
379: 4809| [47] [Salyu]
380: 4812| [45] ["Mm. Near my limit."]
381: 4820| [47] [Natsuhiko]
382: 4823| [45] ["Hahah, okay, how about we head to the roof?"]
383: 4834| [47] [Natsuhiko]
384: 4837| [45] ["That's for sure. Rescue work must be tough..."]
385: 4842| [45] [Natsuhiko looked at his watch as he spoke.]
386: 4856| [47] [Natsuhiko]
387: 4859| [45] ["Wait, it really is kinda late, huh? There's only 40 minutes left of lunch break."]
388: 4937| [47] [Mashiro]
389: 4940| [45] ["Huh, for real?"]
390: 4948| [47] [Salyu]
391: 4951| [45] ["... My hunger's at its limit."]
392: 4956| [45] [Salyu hadn't said a thing before that, but she seemed like she just couldn't keep quiet any longer.]
393: 4982| [47] [Mashiro]
394: 4985| [45] ["My bad, my bad. How about we head to the roof?"]
395: 4990| [45] [The three of them hurried up the stairs...]
