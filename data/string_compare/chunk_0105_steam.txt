  0:    1| [55] [√After Chapter 2]
  1:    8| [47] [Watase]
  2:   11| [45] ["I mean, think about it. Do any of us actually have the skills to repair that card slot?"]
  3:   37| [47] [Ukita]
  4:   40| [45] ["I have some knowledge on the subject. I try to be somewhat informed on the workings of machines."]
  5:   48| [47] [Watase]
  6:   51| [45] ["But you're not -sure- that you can do it, right?"]
  7:   77| [47] [Ukita]
  8:   80| [45] ["Well, true, I can't say anything unless I give it a try..."]
  9:  106| [47] [Jun]
 10:  109| [45] ["Then seeing as we're short on time, how 'bout we split into two groups?"]
 11:  117| [47] [Jun]
 12:  120| [45] ["Mr. Ukita and I will go and take a look at the card slot."]
 13:  146| [47] [Yuuri]
 14:  149| [45] ["U-Um... I'll go with Ms. Moribe too..."]
 15:  175| [47] [Kazami]
 16:  178| [45] ["Then the Captain and I will go check the burning passageway. What will you do, Ms. Tsubakiyama?"]
 17:  186| [47] [Ena]
 18:  189| [45] ["I won't be any help at putting out the fires, so I'll go with Ms. Moribe's group."]
 19:  215| [47] [Ena]
 20:  218| [45] ["I'm sorry... I know I'm the one who suggested it and all, but..."]
 21:  226| [47] [Watase]
 22:  229| [45] ["It's okay, don't worry about it."]
 23:  234| [45] [Watase said that and quickly went on the move with Kazami.]
 24:  376| [45] [He opened the security gate in the connecting passageway, and was greeted by a hallway full of smoke and heat.]
 25:  381| [45] [Fortunately, there wasn't any fire from what he could see.]
 26:  386| [45] [But he could hear the sound of a roaring inferno coming from just past the corner up ahead.]
 27:  391| [45] [When she heard that, Kazami spoke with a frozen look on her face.]
 28:  425| [47] [Kazami]
 29:  428| [45] ["Captain... let's turn back. It's too dangerous."]
 30:  436| [47] [Watase]
 31:  439| [45] ["No, we need to see it with our own eyes to be sure. Let's go."]
 32:  444| [45] [Watase walked down the connecting passageway, accompanied by Kazami.%NThe latter held a fire hose at the ready.]
 33:  480| [45] [The air grew hotter with every step they took, and the roar of the flames gradually became louder and louder.]
 34:  540| [45] [They finally went past the corner and saw--]
 35:  674| [47] [Watase]
 36:  677| [45] ["!!!!"]
 37:  682| [45] [--A world swirling with hellfire.]
 38:  730| [47] [Kazami]
 39:  733| [45] ["Captain, fall back!"]
 40:  738| [45] [Kazami immediately switched the hose on and began hosing down the flames.]
 41:  791| [45] [But no matter how hard she tried to put it out, the force of the fire didn't weaken in the slightest.]
 42:  799| [47] [Kazami]
 43:  802| [45] ["Captain, this won't work at all! Let's retreat!"]
 44:  810| [47] [Watase]
 45:  813| [45] ["No--"]
 46:  818| [45] [Watase stood his ground amidst the heat waves and steam as he stared closely at the blazing flames.]
 47:  823| [45] [The fire was about 5 meters wide--]
 48:  828| [45] [And on the other side of it was the security gate that led to Area 3.]
 49:  891| [47] [Watase]
 50:  892| [45] [(It's... about the same distance as that puddle I jumped over earlier...)]
 51:  957| [45] [--Then it wasn't impossible for him to pull this off.]
 52:  962| [45] [Kazami shouted as soon as she noticed Watase backing up in preparation for a running start.]
 53: 1026| [47] [Kazami]
 54: 1029| [45] ["Captain, what do you think you're doing!?"]
 55: 1072| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1075| [45] ["--Don't worry about it!"]
 57: 1095| [45] [Watase said that, then jumped off the ground with a three step running start.]
 58: 1112| [47] [Watase]
 59: 1115| [45] ["Hah!"]
 60: 1252| [45] [And right after that-- his vision was engulfed by fire.]
 61: 1257| [45] [His hair and skin were instantly scorched.]
 62: 1262| [45] [But right as he gnashed his teeth to endure the pain--]
 63: 1267| [45] [--his body cleared the flames and landed in front of the gate.]
 64: 1338| [47] [Kazami]
 65: 1341| [45] ["Captain, what have you done!?"]
 66: 1346| [45] [Kazami was screaming at him. But he had no time to turn around.]
 67: 1401| [47] [Watase]
 68: 1402| [45] [(Damn, that burns!)]
 69: 1407| [45] [Watase was in the middle of a white hot world full of stagnant air heated by flames.]
 70: 1412| [45] ["Hold your breath. If you don't, your lungs will be burned."]
 71: 1417| [45] [His brain assessed the danger and sent him a stern warning.]
 72: 1444| [47] [Watase]
 73: 1445| [45] [(It'll be okay! I can handle a little heat!)]
 74: 1450| [45] [Watase convinced himself of that as he quickly took out the security card.]
 75: 1455| [45] [Once he opened the gate, he could breathe all he wanted in Area 3.]
 76: 1460| [45] [Then all he'd have to do was run to the engine room and restore the sprinkler system.%NThat'd take care of all the fires in LABO.]
 77: 1465| [47] [Watase]
 78: 1466| [45] [(--I've got this!)]
 79: 1471| [45] [With that confidence brimming inside him, Watase slid the card into the terminal.]
 80: 1476| [45] [But the gate didn't respond in the slightest.]
 81: 1481| [45] [At that moment, his spine went so cold that it was nearly impossible to believe he was surrounded by flames.]
 82: 1486| [47] [Watase]
 83: 1487| [45] [(No, this can't be! A-are you kidding me!?)]
 84: 1492| [45] [Watase tried putting the card in the slot again, his hands trembling as he did.]
 85: 1497| [45] [But nothing changed.]
 86: 1502| [47] [Watase]
 87: 1503| [45] [(Shit! The terminal's completely busted!!)]
 88: 1508| [45] [Watase turned around in terror.]
 89: 1640| [45] [He gazed at the sea of flames standing in his way--]
 90: 1645| [45] [And at that moment, he forgot his situation and instinctively took a breath.]
 91: 1713| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1716| [45] ["--Gaaaagh!"]
 93: 1721| [45] [His lungs burned.]
 94: 1744| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1747| [45] ["Gagh, ghhhhgh, khhhah... gaaagh! G-gaaaaagh!"]
 96: 1752| [45] [His lungs were scorched even further with every cough (if they could even be called that at this point) he took.]
 97: 1757| [47] [Watase]
 98: 1758| [45] [(I... I can't brea--)]
 99: 1801| [47] [Kazami]
100: 1804| [45] ["...!"]
101: 1809| [45] [Kazami turned to the fallen Watase and desperately screamed at him.]
102: 1814| [45] [But he could no longer even understand what she was saying.]
103: 1819| [45] [His vision dimmed, and before long, he saw no more.]
104: 1972| [47] [Ena]
105: 1975| [45] ["Yeah. Maybe we should try to put out those fires in that burning hallway?"]
106: 2001| [47] [Kazami]
107: 2004| [45] ["No, those flames are far too powerful. It's dangerous."]
108: 2082| [47] [Watase]
109: 2083| [45] [(Dammit... I should have listened to Tachibana...)]
110: 2088| [45] [At that moment, Watase's body was doused by a hose's jetstream.]
111: 2093| [45] [It seemed that Kazami had rushed into the flames with the hose in hand.]
112: 2098| [45] [Watase still managed to weave together a thought in his fading consciousness.]
113: 2103| [47] [Watase]
114: 2104| [45] [(Forget it, Tachibana...)]
115: 2109| [47] [Watase]
116: 2110| [45] [(Just forget about me and go join the others...)]
117: 2115| [45] [And as he worried about Kazami risking her life trying to save a fool like him--]
118: 2120| [45] [Watase fell into a deep darkness at the end of his suffering.]
119: 2256| [85] [　%N　%N　%N]
120: 2259| [45] [√A Bad Ending #4 [The Misguided]]
121: 2262| [85] [　]
122: 2265| [45] [The result of picking the wrong plan.]
123: 2268| [85] [　]
124: 2271| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by setting Kazami's Senses higher than Ena's at the SSS input just before this ending.]
