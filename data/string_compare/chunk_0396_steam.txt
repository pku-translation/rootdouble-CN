  1:  107| [45] [--At that moment, Natsuhiko was enveloped in an intense floral scent.]
  2:  112| [45] [And then--]
  3:  232| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  235| [45] ["...?"]
  5:  240| [45] [He suddenly realized he was standing in some unfamiliar place.]
  6:  245| [45] [He appeared to be in the crumbling corridor of an apartment complex.]
  7:  253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  256| [45] ["Why am I suddenly in a place like this...?"]
  9:  261| [45] [Once he muttered that, he heard a voice in front of him.]
 10:  269| [47] [???]
 11:  272| [45] ["Well, that's 'cause this here's a place of Jun's origin-- in a certain sense."]
 12:  297| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  300| [45] ["!!"]
 14:  334| [45] [Before he realized it, Subject N was standing right before him.]
 15:  342| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  345| [45] ["You... What... what the hell is this!?"]
 17:  353| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  356| [45] ["What do you mean 'a place of Jun's origin'!?"]
 19:  382| [47] [Subject N]
 20:  385| [45] ["See, this is where Jun lost someone precious to her nine years back."]
 21:  442| [47] [Subject N]
 22:  445| [45] ["The Rokumei Municipal Apartment Complex got hit by a gas explosion. That's how Jun lost Nagisa."]
 23:  453| [47] [Subject N]
 24:  456| [45] ["She failed to save the girl who was like a little sister to her..."]
 25:  461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  462| [45] ["..."]
 27:  495| [47] [Subject N]
 28:  498| [45] ["It hurt Jun like a bitch after that. Like, can you even begin to imagine?"]
 29:  506| [47] [Subject N]
 30:  509| [45] ["She kept mulling over this same thought: 'I failed to save her 'cause I was so weak'."]
 31:  517| [47] [Subject N]
 32:  520| [45] ["'So I gotta get stronger.'"]
 33:  546| [47] [Subject N]
 34:  549| [45] ["Jun's a cute little thing like that, ain't she...? That's why I learned her a thing or two."]
 35:  575| [47] [Subject N]
 36:  578| [45] ["'Today's dispatch is messed up.' 'Step up your game, or everyone's good as dead.'"]
 37:  586| [47] [Subject N]
 38:  589| [45] ["'Gotta protect everyone even if it means killing anyone suspicious.' Y'know, basic stuff."]
 39:  612| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  615| [45] ["Wha...!?"]
 41:  623| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  626| [45] ["Are you saying that's what made Jun go mad like that!?"]
 43:  652| [47] [Subject N]
 44:  655| [45] ["Could you please not say it like it's my fault, bro? I basically just gave Jun the fuel she wanted."]
 45:  663| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  666| [45] ["Shut up! Jun's not that kind of person!"]
 47:  692| [47] [Subject N]
 48:  695| [45] ["Seriously? You really think so?"]
 49:  721| [47] [Subject N]
 50:  724| [45] ["'The hell do you know about Jun?"]
 51:  732| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  735| [45] ["The hell do I know...?"]
 53:  787| [47] [Subject N]
 54:  790| [45] ["You've seen all of Jun's memories, yeah?"]
 55:  798| [47] [Subject N]
 56:  801| [45] ["Well, whaddya think? Was Jun exactly how you'd pictured her?"]
 57:  817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  820| [45] ["..."]
 59:  854| [47] [Subject N]
 60:  857| [45] ["There ain't no telling what lies behind the masks people wear."]
 61:  865| [47] [Subject N]
 62:  868| [45] ["Life or death situations really bring out the ugly side of people."]
 63:  902| [47] [Subject N]
 64:  905| [45] ["Anything I'm saying here ringing any bells...?"]
 65:  910| [45] [--Her words caused Natsuhiko to realize something.]
 66:  915| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 67:  916| [45] [(I'm not one to talk either, am I...!?)]
 68:  978| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69:  979| [45] [(I tried to kill Watase once...)]
 70:  984| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 71:  985| [45] [(And I was planning on erasing him once I got out of here too...!)]
 72: 1026| [47] [Subject N]
 73: 1029| [45] ["Oh? Looks like I did ring some bells then, eh?"]
 74: 1037| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 75: 1040| [45] ["I-it's not like I wanted to! I had no other choice--"]
 76: 1074| [47] [Subject N]
 77: 1077| [45] ["No other choice... but to do what?"]
 78: 1085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 79: 1088| [45] ["To try... to kill Watase..."]
 80: 1104| [47] [Subject N]
 81: 1107| [45] ["To protect someone, right?"]
 82: 1115| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1118| [45] ["R-right. But that's only because there was no other way..."]
 84: 1152| [47] [Subject N]
 85: 1155| [45] ["Nah, it's totally fine, bro."]
 86: 1163| [47] [Subject N]
 87: 1166| [45] ["When you're left with no other option, you just gotta do what you gotta do, am I right?"]
 88: 1182| [47] [Subject N]
 89: 1185| [45] ["I mean, how else you gonna protect the people you gotta protect?"]
 90: 1190| [45] [Natsuhiko gulped at those words.]
 91: 1203| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1204| [45] [(She's right...)]
 93: 1209| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1210| [45] [(Once you lose the ones precious to you, it's too late to do anything about it...!)]
 95: 1223| [45] [Once that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind, he heard Yuuri's voice.]
 96: 1293| [47] [Yuuri]
 97: 1296| [45] [{H-Hikorin! It's too dangerous!}]
 98: 1304| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 99: 1307| [45] ["!!? Wh-what is!?"]
100: 1331| [47] [Yuuri]
101: 1334| [45] [{Can't you feel it!? She's gradually corroding your thoughts!}]
102: 1339| [47] [Yuuri]
103: 1342| [45] [{It looks like N's malice is too strong! Our memory repairs weren't enough!}]
104: 1350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1353| [45] ["...!"]
106: 1377| [47] [Yuuri]
107: 1380| [45] [{I don't know if it'll work, but erase that girl immediately!}]
108: 1388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1391| [45] ["G-got it!"]
110: 1455| [45] [Natsuhiko gave that answer and stared at Subject N.]
111: 1489| [47] [Natsuhiko]
112: 1492| [45] ["I-I've had enough of your chatter!"]
113: 1500| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1503| [45] ["I'll erase you right now!"]
115: 1537| [47] [Subject N]
116: 1540| [45] ["Oh? A little late to start rushing things, don't you think?"]
117: 1548| [47] [Subject N]
118: 1551| [45] ["Well, whatever. If you say so--"]
119: 1586| [47] [Subject N]
120: 1589| [45] ["Guess it's time for me to bring out the big guns too."]
121: 1594| [45] [She said that to Natsuhiko with a glare.]
122: 1617| [47] [Natsuhiko]
123: 1620| [45] ["..."]
124: 1652| [45] [Her facial expression warped ominously.]
125: 1657| [45] [Even the scenery around them seemed to warp.]
126: 1691| [47] [Subject N]
127: 1694| [45] ["C'mon, fight me."]
128: 1702| [47] [Subject N]
129: 1705| [45] ["Who'll be quicker to the draw-- me with my destruction of your mind, or you with your erasure of me?"]
130: 1739| [47] [Subject N]
131: 1742| [45] ["Only one way to find out!"]
132: 1810| [47] [Natsuhiko]
133: 1811| [45] [(!!)]
134: 1816| [45] [Malice descended upon Natsuhiko like a gale with that shout.]
135: 1849| [45] [--It was full of the many negative feelings in Jun's mind. ]
136: 1854| [45] [An ugly mind composed of indignation and jealousy.]
137: 1859| [45] [All of that had been amplified to the nth power and was worming its way into Natsuhiko's mind.]
138: 1892| [47] [Natsuhiko]
139: 1893| [45] [(Kgh, ugh, gh...!)]
140: 1898| [45] [Natsuhiko could feel the malice seeping into his own mind.]
141: 1931| [45] [The pitch black emotions began to rule his very spirit.]
142: 1936| [47] [Natsuhiko]
143: 1937| [45] [(Y-Yuuri! I can't make it! Help!)]
144: 1970| [45] [Natsuhiko sought Yuuri's help, but--]
145: 2040| [47] [Yuuri]
146: 2043| [45] [{I-it's no good! Not only am I unable to catch up with the repairs--}]
147: 2067| [47] [Yuuri]
148: 2070| [45] [{The malice is even infecting me too...!}]
149: 2075| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2076| [45] [(Wh-what!?)]
151: 2100| [47] [Yuuri]
152: 2103| [45] [{H-Hikorin... we can't win... at this rate...!}]
153: 2108| [47] [Yuuri]
154: 2111| [45] [{Let's return to reality for now before the malice consumes us!}]
155: 2116| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2117| [45] [(Y-yeah!)]
157: 2181| [45] [And thus, the two Communicators canceled Senses Sympathy at the same time.]
158: 2186| [45] [--But the moment they returned to reality--]
159: 2280| [45] [They saw Jun start moving right in front of them.]
160: 2288| [47] [Natsuhiko]
161: 2291| [45] ["Agh!"]
162: 2296| [45] [Natsuhiko had no time to stop her.]
163: 2331| [45] [Jun switched on the engine cutter--]
164: 2357| [47] [Natsuhiko]
165: 2360| [45] ["!!"]
166: 2448| [45] [And slashed Natsuhiko diagonally from his shoulder down to his chest.]
167: 2552| [47] [Natsuhiko]
168: 2555| [45] ["Ghh... aaahhh!"]
169: 2560| [45] [Natsuhiko screamed at the pain that came a second late.]
170: 2582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2583| [45] [(It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!)]
172: 2588| [45] [That was all he could manage to think.]
173: 2593| [45] [His thoughts were seeped in pain. His concentration failed.]
174: 2622| [45] [The intense pain drove away even his consciousness--...]
175: 2678| [45] [... And in his dulled sense of hearing, he heard something in his surroundings as if it were far away.]
176: 2692| [47] [???]
177: 2695| [45] ["Die!"]
178: 2703| [47] [???]
179: 2706| [45] ["Uwah! Gh-gyyahhhhh--!"]
180: 2714| [47] [???]
181: 2717| [45] ["Wha-- S-stop!"]
182: 2731| [47] [???]
183: 2734| [45] ["Ughh... wh-why you!"]
184: 2765| [47] [???]
185: 2768| [45] ["Kh... ah...gh"]
186: 2800| [47] [???]
187: 2803| [45] ["Ugh... gh..."]
188: 2811| [47] [???]
189: 2814| [45] ["That's right...! Sis..."]
190: 2822| [47] [???]
191: 2825| [45] ["I gotta go... to where Sis is..."]
192: 2830| [45] [--Natsuhiko fainted as he heard those voices.]
193: 2847| [45] [... An unknown amount of time passed.]
194: 2852| [45] [Eventually, Natsuhiko woke up.]
195: 2973| [47] [Yuuri]
196: 2976| [45] ["Ah... Hikorin..."]
197: 2984| [47] [Natsuhiko]
198: 2987| [45] ["Y-Yuuri...?"]
199: 2992| [45] [Yuuri was absentmindedly treating the wound on Natsuhiko's chest.]
200: 2997| [45] [He sat himself up, and then--]
201: 3048| [45] [--he became speechless at the sight around him.]
202: 3110| [47] [Natsuhiko]
203: 3113| [45] ["Wh... what the hell... is this..."]
204: 3118| [45] [Ukita and Ena were on the ground. Blood was oozing out of Ukita's chest and Ena's neck.]
205: 3123| [45] [The intense stench of blood spelled their deaths.]
206: 3131| [47] [Natsuhiko]
207: 3134| [45] ["Yuuri, what happened...!?"]
208: 3142| [47] [Yuuri]
209: 3145| [45] ["Ms. Jun... she..."]
210: 3150| [45] [So it really was Jun's doing. Natsuhiko had guessed as much judging from the voices he had heard.]
211: 3155| [45] [But she wasn't in the room.]
212: 3160| [45] [The only other sign she'd been there was a trail of trickled blood on the floor that led outside the room...]
213: 3168| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3171| [45] ["D-did she... spare us...?"]
215: 3223| [47] [Yuuri]
216: 3226| [45] ["... Yeah, probably..."]
217: 3231| [45] [Natsuhiko was wounded, but Yuuri was uninjured.]
218: 3236| [45] [Mashiro was still asleep on the bed.]
219: 3241| [45] [Yuuri looked at the bodies and murmured.]
220: 3249| [47] [Yuuri]
221: 3252| [45] ["Ms. Jun might have a little bit of reason left in her, but..."]
222: 3278| [47] [Yuuri]
223: 3281| [45] ["But this is... just too much...!"]
224: 3286| [45] [Those words gouged Natsuhiko's heart.]
225: 3319| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 3320| [45] [(It's my fault...)]
227: 3325| [47] [Natsuhiko]
228: 3326| [45] [(It's because I didn't erase Subject N properly...)]
229: 3331| [45] [He happened to catch sight of a single gun lying on the floor.]
230: 3336| [45] [It was the gun Watase had left for Ukita.]
231: 3341| [45] [It appeared that at the last minute, Ukita hesitated to shoot Jun, and she killed him.]
232: 3346| [47] [Natsuhiko]
233: 3347| [45] [(So that's it... It's all just as she said...)]
234: 3352| [47] [Natsuhiko]
235: 3353| [45] [("When you're left with no other option, you have to kill." "Or else you can't protect those precious to you"...)]
236: 3358| [47] [Natsuhiko]
237: 3359| [45] [(That's why Jun killed them...)]
238: 3364| [47] [Natsuhiko]
239: 3365| [45] [(So this time, it's my turn...)]
240: 3417| [45] [At that moment, strength suddenly left Natsuhiko's body.]
241: 3450| [47] [Yuuri]
242: 3453| [45] ["Huh... H-Hikorin!?"]
243: 3458| [45] [Yuuri panicked and peered into Natsuhiko's face.]
244: 3484| [47] [Yuuri]
245: 3487| [45] ["Hikorin! Hikorin!"]
246: 3495| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 3498| [45] ["..."]
248: 3505| [45] [He tried to answer, but couldn't use his voice.]
249: 3532| [45] [His vision was quickly growing dark.]
250: 3537| [47] [Natsuhiko]
251: 3538| [45] [(Dammit... I've lost too much blood...)]
252: 3543| [47] [Natsuhiko]
253: 3544| [45] [(No... I can't die here...)]
254: 3549| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3550| [45] [(... I can't die here and leave Yuuri and the others behind...!)]
256: 3555| [45] [But eventually, even that emotion--]
257: 3600| [45] [--was engulfed by the pressing darkness.]
258: 3729| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%Nã€€%N]
259: 3732| [45] [âˆšD Bad Ending #4 [The Malicious Challenger]]
260: 3735| [85] [ã€€]
261: 3738| [45] [The result of failing to remove enough of Jun's malice.]
262: 3741| [85] [ã€€]
263: 3744| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by providing adequate repairs on Jun's memories in the RAM System.]
