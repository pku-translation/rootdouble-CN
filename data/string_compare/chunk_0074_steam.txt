  1:   47| [47] [Jun]
  2:   50| [45] ["What do you mean, my back was inj... agh! Ow!!"]
  3:   55| [45] [Jun's body writhed in agony. It seemed she'd just noticed her own wound.]
  4:   63| [47] [Watase]
  5:   66| [45] ["So well, you see... I'm sorry, but you'll have to remove your clothes so I can seal up the wound."]
  6:   92| [47] [Jun]
  7:   95| [45] ["... Oh, well in that case... guess we've got no other choice then."]
  8:  103| [47] [Jun]
  9:  106| [45] ["But don't be surprised about what you see, okay?"]
 10:  111| [45] [Jun said that in a defeated voice, turned her back to Watase--]
 11:  116| [45] [And unzipped her uniform.]
 12:  165| [45] [Jun didn't hesitate for a moment as she removed her uniform, then took off her bloodstained T-shirt.]
 13:  170| [45] [Her back was now exposed.]
 14:  286| [45] [Watase had thought she was short-statured, but only now did it hit him just how small her body was.]
 15:  291| [45] [There was a wound about 2 cm wide bleeding below her right shoulder-blade.]
 16:  296| [45] [But that wasn't what caught Watase's eye.]
 17:  304| [47] [Watase]
 18:  307| [45] ["...!"]
 19:  312| [45] [There was a wide scar that looked like badly inflamed skin that spanned from her right shoulder to about halfway down her back.]
 20:  317| [47] [Watase]
 21:  318| [45] [(Is this... a burn scar?)]
 22:  323| [45] [It was clear that she hadn't gotten it recently, but rather a long time ago.]
 23:  331| [47] [Jun]
 24:  334| [45] ["Captain, hurry up."]
 25:  342| [47] [Watase]
 26:  345| [45] ["R-right..."]
 27:  390| [45] [Watase quickly spread the Chiron on Jun's wound at her urging.]
 28:  398| [47] [Jun]
 29:  401| [45] ["..."]
 30:  406| [45] [Jun's body twitched as if she were being tickled.]
 31:  414| [47] [Watase]
 32:  417| [45] ["Sorry Moribe, but put up with it for a while."]
 33:  422| [45] [Watase said that and continued treating her.]
 34:  427| [45] [Jun's wound finally closed up after Watase had used half the tube on it.]
 35:  435| [47] [Watase]
 36:  438| [45] ["... Done."]
 37:  483| [45] [Jun let the tension out of her shoulders when she heard that.]
 38:  488| [45] [Her back was sweaty, dyeing the burn scar a pale crimson.]
 39:  536| [47] [Jun]
 40:  539| [45] ["... Does it bother you?"]
 41:  547| [47] [Watase]
 42:  550| [45] ["Ah, no... sorry..."]
 43:  558| [47] [Jun]
 44:  561| [45] ["No, don't worry about it. I'm letting you see it because it's you."]
 45:  566| [45] [There was a faint hint of expectation in her words.]
 46:  571| [45] [Watase decided to take her up on that and satisfy his curiosity.]
 47:  579| [47] [Watase]
 48:  582| [45] ["Say... how'd you get that burn scar? It's pretty obvious you've had it for quite a while."]
 49:  630| [47] [Jun]
 50:  633| [45] ["I got it in a gas explosion accident ten years ago..."]
 51:  641| [47] [Watase]
 52:  644| [45] ["A 'gas explosion accident'...?"]
 53:  649| [45] [Watase was taken aback.]
 54:  654| [45] [That's right, Kazami's little sister had died in a--!]
 55:  662| [47] [Watase]
 56:  665| [45] ["Moribe, don't tell me you were there when it happened!"]
 57:  670| [45] [Jun quietly began talking.]
 58:  678| [47] [Jun]
 59:  681| [45] ["... Yeah. I went to visit Nagisa at her apartment that day."]
 60:  689| [47] [Jun]
 61:  692| [45] ["The two of us were just playing around, when all of a sudden we heard this noise so loud that it felt like my ears were gonna burst--"]
 62:  700| [47] [Jun]
 63:  703| [45] ["By the time I came to my senses, we were trapped under rubble."]
 64:  711| [47] [Jun]
 65:  714| [45] ["We couldn't move around, and no one came to help no matter how much we cried for it..."]
 66:  719| [45] [--So that burn scar was probably from then.]
 67:  724| [45] [Jun continued in an awfully low voice.]
 68:  732| [47] [Jun]
 69:  735| [45] ["Eventually, help did come, and Nagisa and I were saved..."]
 70:  743| [47] [Jun]
 71:  746| [45] ["But Nagisa'd been hit on the head... and she passed away two days later."]
 72:  754| [47] [Watase]
 73:  757| [45] ["I see... so that's what..."]
 74:  762| [45] [Watase let his voice trail off as he remained unsure of what to do.]
 75:  767| [45] [Jun continued without a hint of sorrow in her voice.]
 76:  815| [47] [Jun]
 77:  818| [45] ["... I loved Nagisa, you know."]
 78:  826| [47] [Jun]
 79:  829| [45] ["She was so pure-hearted, kind, and considerate..."]
 80:  837| [47] [Jun]
 81:  840| [45] ["I always felt like she was my salvation whenever I was with her."]
 82:  848| [47] [Jun]
 83:  851| [45] ["So when that accident happened, I wanted to do whatever I could to save her... but I was totally powerless back then..."]
 84:  856| [45] [Jun gritted her teeth in resentment toward her past self.]
 85:  861| [45] [Watase understood everything when he saw that look on her face.]
 86:  869| [47] [Watase]
 87:  872| [45] ["So that's why you became a rescue worker...?"]
 88:  877| [45] [With that small body of hers, Jun was not suited to be a rescue worker in any definition of the term.]
 89:  882| [45] [And yet here she was.]
 90:  887| [45] [How much had she put herself through to make her body fit enough to become a rescue worker?]
 91:  892| [45] [Watase felt true admiration for that ironclad conviction of hers.]
 92:  900| [47] [Watase]
 93:  903| [45] ["... So you entered this line of work for the same reasons as Tachibana, huh?"]
 94:  911| [47] [Jun]
 95:  914| [45] ["Yeah... well, there's more to it than just that, but yeah, it was the biggest reason."]
 96:  922| [47] [Jun]
 97:  925| [45] ["I don't want a repeat of that day ever again. I don't want my powerlessness to stop me from helping someone close to me, not when they're suffering right before my eyes."]
 98:  933| [47] [Jun]
 99:  936| [45] ["This burn scar is a symbol of that time in my life where I was weak."]
100:  944| [47] [Jun]
101:  947| [45] ["So I thought I'd never show it to anyone except someone I completely trust..."]
102:  995| [47] [Jun]
103:  998| [45] ["But I never thought that someone would be you of all people. Funny, huh?"]
104: 1003| [45] [Jun gave him an awkward smile.]
105: 1008| [45] [Watase understood painfully well just how significant this scar was to Jun.]
106: 1013| [45] [So he also forced a smile and answered her.]
107: 1021| [47] [Watase]
108: 1024| [45] ["No, I don't deserve that right. Not after I let you get hurt like that."]
109: 1032| [47] [Jun]
110: 1035| [45] ["What're you talking about? We're buddies, so a few scratches here and there mean nothing, right?"]
111: 1043| [47] [Watase]
112: 1046| [45] ["... Buddies, huh?"]
113: 1051| [45] [That was right. Watase remembered the promise they'd made just before they ran into that contaminated zone--]
114: 1056| [45] [He and Jun were partners who held a mutual trust in each other.]
115: 1064| [47] [Watase]
116: 1067| [45] ["... I'm surprised you're calling me that. I mean, I've just been an unreliable greenhorn who let his squadmate get hurt."]
117: 1075| [47] [Jun]
118: 1078| [45] ["You're not unreliable. If you were, then I wouldn't have shown you this scar that I've never let anyone else see."]
119: 1086| [47] [Jun]
120: 1089| [45] ["... I did it because I have high hopes in you."]
121: 1097| [47] [Jun]
122: 1100| [45] ["So please... please don't do anything to betray my hopes, you hear?"]
123: 1108| [47] [Watase]
124: 1111| [45] ["Yeah, you can bet on that."]
125: 1119| [47] [Jun]
126: 1122| [45] ["Absolutely positively?"]
127: 1130| [47] [Watase]
128: 1133| [45] ["I keep my promises."]
129: 1141| [47] [Watase]
130: 1144| [45] ["I'll keep living up to the trust you've put in me... as your buddy."]
131: 1149| [45] [Jun then gave him a tender smile.]
132: 1157| [47] [Jun]
133: 1160| [45] ["... Thanks, Captain. You really are a whole lot different today, you know that?"]
134: 1168| [47] [Watase]
135: 1171| [45] ["Well, I'm only half as efficient and persuasive as I normally am, but bear with me."]
136: 1179| [47] [Jun]
137: 1182| [45] ["No, that's not what I mean."]
138: 1190| [47] [Jun]
139: 1193| [45] ["I mean that you're much kinder and gentler than normal."]
140: 1201| [47] [Watase]
141: 1204| [45] ["Huh...?"]
142: 1209| [45] [Watase's heart leapt at those words.]
143: 1214| [45] [A small blush crossed Jun's face.]
144: 1262| [47] [Jun]
145: 1265| [45] ["Hey... maybe you'll get mad at me for saying something like this right now..."]
146: 1273| [47] [Jun]
147: 1276| [45] ["But I like the you of today."]
148: 1284| [47] [Jun]
149: 1287| [45] ["Much more than I do the normal you..."]
150: 1292| [45] [Watase gulped loudly.]
151: 1297| [45] [To receive such honest affection from a girl twelve years younger than him-- there was no way he wasn't happy about that.]
152: 1302| [45] [But any more than that left him at a loss.]
153: 1310| [47] [Watase]
154: 1313| [45] ["Wh... what are you talking about? I'm 32 years old. I'm an old fart compared to you, you know?"]
155: 1321| [47] [Watase]
156: 1324| [45] ["I'm sure there's someone much more suitable for a young girl like you--"]
157: 1332| [47] [Jun]
158: 1335| [45] ["You dummy, that's not what I meant. I meant that I'm happy to be teamed up with you as your buddy."]
159: 1343| [47] [Watase]
160: 1346| [45] ["Ph-phew... don't startle me like that."]
161: 1394| [47] [Jun]
162: 1397| [45] ["Ohhhh? Why so flustered?"]
163: 1405| [47] [Jun]
164: 1408| [45] ["Did looking at my bare skin fill your head with dirty thoughts? Is that why you interpreted what I said that way?"]
165: 1416| [47] [Watase]
166: 1419| [45] ["Hey, I'm still a guy. I can't help it, right?"]
167: 1424| [45] [Watase and Jun shared a laugh.]
168: 1429| [45] [Laughs filled with such peaceful emotions that almost didn't match the life-or-death situation they were stuck in--]
169: 1472| [45] [With her treatment completed, Jun put her clothes back on.]
170: 1534| [47] [Jun]
171: 1537| [45] ["... Honestly, I wish you could stay this way forever..."]
172: 1545| [47] [Watase]
173: 1548| [45] ["Huh? But I'm me. That fact will never change."]
174: 1574| [47] [Jun]
175: 1577| [45] ["Well, yeah, but... it's just..."]
176: 1585| [47] [Jun]
177: 1588| [45] ["I worry that once you get your memories back, the you I'm looking at right now will be gone forever..."]
178: 1596| [47] [Watase]
179: 1599| [45] ["...!"]
180: 1604| [45] [--The words Jun blurted out held an ominous ring to Watase.]
181: 1609| [45] [But he quickly shook it off.]
182: 1617| [47] [Watase]
183: 1620| [45] ["... Don't talk nonsense. I'll never go away."]
184: 1628| [47] [Watase]
185: 1631| [45] ["Not without your permission, that is..."]
186: 1657| [47] [Jun]
187: 1660| [45] ["Yeah... I'd appreciate that."]
188: 1665| [45] [Watase gave Jun a reassuring nod to drive away her fears.]
189: 1670| [45] [They then looked at the time to find that they'd been in this room for quite a while.]
190: 1678| [47] [Watase]
191: 1681| [45] ["Oh crap... this isn't good, old man Ukita went on ahead to keep on searching."]
192: 1707| [47] [Jun]
193: 1710| [45] ["Huh? By himself?"]
194: 1718| [47] [Watase]
195: 1721| [45] ["We promised that we'd meet up in Area 2. I need to get a move on fast."]
196: 1747| [47] [Jun]
197: 1750| [45] ["Then I'll come with--"]
198: 1782| [45] [Jun then tried to stand up, but she staggered on her feet.]
199: 1790| [47] [Watase]
200: 1793| [45] ["No, you just got hit on the head. Just rest here for the time being."]
201: 1801| [47] [Watase]
202: 1804| [45] ["I'm heading in the direction of Area 2. Catch up to me once you recover."]
203: 1830| [47] [Jun]
204: 1833| [45] ["Mmm... okay, I'll do what you say."]
205: 1841| [47] [Watase]
206: 1844| [45] ["Yeah, see you later."]
207: 1849| [45] [Watase waved to Jun and left the laboratory.]
208: 1898| [45] [He ran over to Area 2 as fast as he could to make up for the lost time he'd spent treating Jun.]
