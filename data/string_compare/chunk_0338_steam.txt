  0:   56| [45] [--After finishing their break in the engine room, Jun and the others hid their exhaustion and pressed on.]
  1:   61| [45] [They continued to search the facility for the survivors that were almost certainly there.]
  2:   66| [45] [But then, as if to crush those hopes--]
  3:  126| [45] [They discovered yet another victim.]
  4:  157| [45] [It was the final member of Team A, "Hiyama".]
  5:  165| [47] [Watase]
  6:  168| [45] ["It's too late... he's already... dead."]
  7:  176| [47] [Kazami]
  8:  179| [45] ["No... no..."]
  9:  187| [47] [Jun]
 10:  190| [45] ["Hiyama, not you too...!"]
 11:  243| [45] [Kazami spoke bitterly to the utterly speechless Watase.]
 12:  269| [47] [Kazami]
 13:  272| [45] ["... Dying in the line of duty is an unavoidable risk in this line of work."]
 14:  298| [47] [Watase]
 15:  301| [45] ["But Tachibana..."]
 16:  327| [47] [Kazami]
 17:  330| [45] ["Please don't say anything, Captain."]
 18:  338| [47] [Kazami]
 19:  341| [45] ["We can save our grief for after we've rescued the survivors and gotten outside."]
 20:  346| [45] [Kazami's noble words just served to pierce through Jun's heart.]
 21:  372| [47] [Kazami]
 22:  375| [45] ["You have to do the same, Moribe..."]
 23:  383| [47] [Jun]
 24:  386| [45] ["But... today was the first time... I've ever lost a coworker on the job..."]
 25:  489| [47] [Jun]
 26:  492| [45] ["And now... it's happened... again..."]
 27:  518| [47] [Kazami]
 28:  521| [45] ["I know. But you have to hold your head high. You discarded your womanhood when you joined Sirius. Remember that."]
 29:  529| [47] [Jun]
 30:  532| [45] ["But... Sis...!"]
 31:  537| [45] [Jun said that in a frail voice like that of a normal girl.]
 32:  542| [47] [Jun]
 33:  543| [45] [(Why is everyone around me dying...!?)]
 34:  826| [47] [Ena]
 35:  829| [45] ["Hey, how long are you gonna keep crying about it?"]
 36:  867| [47] [Jun]
 37:  870| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 38:  898| [47] [Ena]
 39:  901| [45] ["You have my sympathies on your coworker's passing... but it's not much help for us to have a weeping wreck for a rescue worker."]
 40:  954| [47] [Ena]
 41:  957| [45] ["And besides, we're still low on AD... so shouldn't we get going?"]
 42: 1024| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 43: 1292| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1295| [45] ["Hang in there, Jun."]
 45: 1308| [47] [Jun]
 46: 1311| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 47: 1350| [47] [Jun]
 48: 1353| [45] ["C-Captain, what're you doing!?"]
 49: 1366| [47] [Watase]
 50: 1369| [45] ["Don't worry about that. Just listen to me."]
 51: 1423| [47] [Watase]
 52: 1426| [45] ["I know it must be hard for you to have lost two squadmates. I don't even have memories, and it's hard on me too."]
 53: 1439| [47] [Watase]
 54: 1442| [45] ["I know you're scared. No matter what, you're still a girl."]
 55: 1509| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 56: 1656| [47] [Jun]
 57: 1657| [45] [(Could it be that both Sis and the Captain are also...!)]
 58: 1662| [45] [The radiation levels throughout the whole facility were already past 3000 mSv.]
 59: 1716| [45] [If it kept on rising, then no amount of AD they took could guarantee their lives anymore.]
 60: 1721| [45] [In the first place, they didn't even have enough AD at the moment.]
 61: 1736| [47] [Jun]
 62: 1737| [45] [(Everyone here could die...!)]
 63: 1742| [47] [Jun]
 64: 1743| [45] [(I'm gonna be broken down to my genes too... all battered and dead in this dark basement!)]
 65: 1748| [45] [Just as Jun thought that--]
 66: 1781| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1784| [45] ["Tachibana, Moribe... can I have a minute?"]
 68: 1789| [45] [Watase suddenly spoke up.]
 69: 1822| [47] [Kazami]
 70: 1825| [45] ["Huh?"]
 71: 1851| [47] [Watase]
 72: 1854| [45] ["We're changing leaders. I'll lead the group from this point onwards."]
 73: 1862| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1865| [45] ["C-Captain...?"]
 75: 1873| [47] [Watase]
 76: 1876| [45] ["I'll be the leader for now until you've both calmed down. Let me shoulder all the weight you've been carrying so far."]
 77: 1899| [47] [Kazami]
 78: 1900| [45] ["..."]
 79: 1928| [47] [Watase]
 80: 1931| [45] ["Didn't you hear me? Then let me make it an order-- as Sirius' captain."]
 81: 1957| [47] [Watase]
 82: 1960| [45] ["As of this point onwards, Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana and Ensign Jun Moribe will hereby defer to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command!"]
 83: 2007| [47] [Kazami & Jun]
 84: 2010| [45] ["!!"]
 85: 2015| [45] [Jun and Kazami's bodies shook at those words.]
 86: 2020| [45] [It was like Watase was back to being the man he was before he lost his memories.]
 87: 2046| [47] [Watase]
 88: 2049| [45] ["Now let me hear you say it!"]
 89: 2054| [45] [Jun and Kazami instinctively clicked their heels and replied in response to that command.]
 90: 2080| [47] [Kazami]
 91: 2083| [45] ["Sir! Lieutenant Kazami Tachibana deferring to Captain Watase Kasasagi's command, sir!"]
 92: 2091| [47] [Jun]
 93: 2094| [45] ["E-Ensign Jun Moribe deferring to Captain's command, sir!"]
 94: 2120| [47] [Watase]
 95: 2123| [45] ["Good!"]
 96: 2128| [45] [Watase gave a broad grin, then continued.]
 97: 2154| [47] [Watase]
 98: 2157| [45] ["... And there you have it. Well, that was mainly for formality's sake-- I'm still counting on you both to basically keep things running the way they've been so far."]
 99: 2183| [47] [Kazami]
100: 2186| [45] ["Y-yes... please."]
101: 2212| [47] [Watase]
102: 2215| [45] ["Good. Then now that we've finally got our hands on a Level 6 card, let's use it to press onwards."]
103: 2241| [47] [Watase]
104: 2244| [45] ["... Hiyama left that card for us. We can't let it go to waste."]
105: 2267| [45] ["Hiyama left that card for us"-- those words reignited Jun's spirit.]
106: 2272| [45] [She managed to recover just as she was about to fall off the brink of despair.]
107: 2280| [47] [Jun]
108: 2283| [45] ["You're right... we can't keep staying down in the dumps forever."]
109: 2291| [47] [Jun]
110: 2294| [45] ["The fires are out and we've got a card, so now we can now go all the way to Area 6.%NWe have nothing to fear!"]
111: 2320| [47] [Watase]
112: 2323| [45] ["Yeah, that's the spirit!"]
113: 2349| [45] [Watase grinned and patted Jun on the shoulder.]
114: 2354| [45] [She could feel the strength and warmth of his hand though that gesture.]
115: 2359| [47] [Jun]
116: 2360| [45] [(That's right... we're still alive.)]
117: 2365| [47] [Jun]
118: 2366| [45] [(Which means we've gotta do everything in our power... to survive!)]
119: 2413| [45] [Jun looked at Hiyama's body.]
120: 2418| [45] [His legs had been broken, he'd caught on fire, and he most likely had spent his last moments in utter despair, but despite all that, he'd still tried to survive.]
121: 2423| [45] [He would never come back.]
122: 2428| [45] [But he had left their group the key they needed to keep moving forward.]
123: 2433| [45] [In that key lay what was most certainly the will of someone who had lived to their fullest.]
124: 2438| [45] [Those who had been entrusted with that will would accept it and carry it with them for the rest of their lives.]
125: 2443| [45] [Much like how it was Nagisa's existence that had brought Kazami and Jun to where they were now.]
126: 2448| [47] [Jun]
127: 2449| [45] [(Thanks, Captain. And thank you too, Hiyama...)]
128: 2454| [47] [Jun]
129: 2455| [45] [(I'm still alive, and will do everything I can to survive until the bitter end.)]
130: 2466| [45] [Thus-- she would use her life to accomplish what had to be done:]
131: 2471| [45] [Saving human lives.]
132: 2476| [47] [Jun]
133: 2477| [45] [(That's right... that's the whole reason I came here, after all.)]
134: 2482| [45] [Jun clenched her hands into tight fists when she thought that.]
135: 2602| [45] [When Jun thought that-- a cold voice called out to her.]
136: 2641| [47] [Ena]
137: 2644| [45] ["Hey, how long are you gonna keep crying about it?"]
138: 2652| [47] [Jun]
139: 2655| [45] ["Huh...?"]
140: 2681| [47] [Ena]
141: 2684| [45] ["You have my sympathies on your coworker's passing... but it's not much help for us to have a weeping wreck for a rescue worker."]
142: 2710| [47] [Ena]
143: 2713| [45] ["And besides, we're still low on AD... so shouldn't we get going?"]
144: 2736| [47] [Jun]
145: 2739| [45] ["..."]
146: 2744| [45] [Jun was utterly speechless at how callous those words had been.]
147: 2753| [45] [But the others all started speaking before she could.]
148: 2779| [47] [Ukita]
149: 2782| [45] ["Indeed... we may meet the same fate as this man if we don't get enough AD in time."]
150: 2808| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 2811| [45] ["... I... don't want to... die..."]
152: 2819| [47] [Jun]
153: 2822| [45] ["No way..."]
154: 2827| [45] [Jun let out a faint protest, but Watase and Kazami--]
155: 2853| [47] [Watase]
156: 2856| [45] ["... They're right, Moribe. Crying won't change our luck for the better now."]
157: 2882| [47] [Kazami]
158: 2885| [45] ["... You're correct... it's in times like these where we must harden our hearts..."]
159: 2890| [45] [--Those words hit Jun like a slap to the face.]
160: 2895| [45] [She thought they were all being way too cold, but--]
161: 3030| [47] [Jun]
162: 3031| [45] [(They're right... I'll be no different from a normal girl if I break down here...!)]
163: 3036| [45] [Jun put on a brave face and spoke.]
164: 3044| [47] [Jun]
165: 3047| [45] ["You're right... we can't keep staying down in the dumps forever."]
166: 3052| [45] [She decided to listen to her own advice.]
167: 3057| [47] [Jun]
168: 3058| [45] [(I'm a rescue worker... I've gotta be strong...!)]
169: 3119| [45] [As Jun thought to herself-- Watase suddenly spoke to her.]
170: 3198| [47] [Watase]
171: 3201| [45] ["Hang in there, Jun."]
172: 3209| [47] [Jun]
173: 3212| [45] ["Huh...?"]
174: 3221| [45] [Before she even realized what was happening, Watase had wrapped his arms around her.]
175: 3226| [45] [That completely unexpected embrace left Jun at a loss for words.]
176: 3234| [47] [Jun]
177: 3237| [45] ["C-Captain, what're you doing!?"]
178: 3245| [47] [Watase]
179: 3248| [45] ["Don't worry about that. Just listen to me."]
180: 3275| [47] [Watase]
181: 3278| [45] ["I know it must be hard for you to have lost two squadmates. I don't even have memories, and it's hard on me too."]
182: 3286| [47] [Watase]
183: 3289| [45] ["I know you're scared. No matter what, you're still a girl."]
184: 3316| [47] [Watase]
185: 3319| [45] ["And you might think I'm being harsh when I say this, but..."]
186: 3346| [47] [Watase]
187: 3349| [45] ["Now's not the time to cry."]
188: 3357| [47] [Jun]
189: 3360| [45] ["...!"]
190: 3387| [47] [Watase]
191: 3390| [45] ["Do that and you could lose your life too."]
192: 3398| [47] [Watase]
193: 3401| [45] ["I don't want any more of that... I'll be damned if I lost you too."]
194: 3409| [47] [Watase]
195: 3412| [45] ["So hold yourself together."]
196: 3420| [47] [Jun]
197: 3423| [45] ["B-but..."]
198: 3430| [45] [Watase then whispered into Jun's ear.]
199: 3457| [47] [Watase]
200: 3460| [45] ["Please, Jun. You could be in danger here too if you don't pull yourself together."]
201: 3468| [47] [Jun]
202: 3471| [45] ["Huh?"]
203: 3534| [47] [Watase]
204: 3537| [45] ["You noticed how Hiyama's legs were broken, right? If that wasn't just an accident, then that means--"]
205: 3593| [47] [Watase]
206: 3596| [45] ["--the bastard who killed Dojima could be responsible for that, too."]
207: 3604| [47] [Jun]
208: 3607| [45] ["Ah...!"]
209: 3665| [47] [Watase]
210: 3668| [45] ["Tachibana will probably just shoot the idea down again if we talk about it in front of her..."]
211: 3695| [47] [Watase]
212: 3698| [45] ["But there could very well be a killer wandering around this facility."]
213: 3706| [47] [Watase]
214: 3709| [45] ["If we don't protect ourselves from that son of a bitch, we'll be next...!"]
215: 3717| [47] [Jun]
216: 3720| [45] ["G... got it!"]
217: 3725| [45] [Jun replied with as much courage as she could muster.]
218: 3730| [45] [Watase then answered her in a kind voice.]
219: 3757| [47] [Watase]
220: 3760| [45] ["There, that's a good girl."]
221: 3768| [47] [Jun]
222: 3771| [45] ["B-but if we ever come across the killer... what're we gonna do then?"]
223: 3798| [47] [Watase]
224: 3801| [45] ["That'll depend on the situation..."]
225: 3828| [47] [Watase]
226: 3831| [45] ["... but I'll probably knock him the hell out."]
227: 3839| [47] [Jun]
228: 3842| [45] ["But you're a rescue worker... Are you really gonna resort to violence...?"]
229: 3869| [47] [Watase]
230: 3872| [45] ["You dummy, we don't have the luxury to worry about that. We're up against a killer here, you know?"]
231: 3899| [47] [Watase]
232: 3902| [45] ["If I have to use force to protect all of you, then I won't hesitate to do so."]
233: 3910| [47] [Jun]
234: 3913| [45] ["I see... so it's to protect us all..."]
235: 3940| [47] [Watase]
236: 3943| [45] ["But that's a man's job. If you ever come across the guy, run."]
237: 3951| [47] [Jun]
238: 3954| [45] ["... Okay."]
239: 3987| [45] [Watase then let go of Jun.]
240: 3992| [45] [She then thought to herself while feeling the lingering sensation of his whispers in her ears and the warmth of his arms.]
241: 3997| [47] [Jun]
242: 3998| [45] [(I dunno if that killer is still here in this facility...)]
243: 4003| [47] [Jun]
244: 4004| [45] [(But if I ever find them-- then do I have to fight to protect everyone...!?)]
245: 4009| [45] [--Her job as a rescue worker was to protect lives.]
246: 4014| [45] [Perhaps she needed to get her hands dirty to accomplish that job.]
247: 4019| [45] [After all, two of her squadmates had already been killed.]
248: 4024| [47] [Jun]
249: 4025| [45] [(... No, I shouldn't think about that yet.)]
250: 4030| [47] [Jun]
251: 4031| [45] [(Not until I'm sure that there's actually a killer here...)]
252: 4038| [45] [Jun then changed tracks to thinking about something else--]
253: 4043| [45] [But a pitch black will had begun to manifest in the depths of her heart.]
254: 4097| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
255: 4102| [47] [Natsuhiko]
256: 4103| [45] [(... This is horrible...! Is this the altered memory that caused Jun to change so much!?)]
257: 4108| [47] [Natsuhiko]
258: 4109| [45] [(Anyway, I've got to adjust her desire to protect everyone!)]
259: 4143| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
260: 4148| [47] [Natsuhiko]
261: 4149| [45] [(... Kind of a subtle alteration this time around.)]
262: 4154| [47] [Natsuhiko]
263: 4155| [45] [(Should I adjust things so her feelings are more in tune with those of a rescue worker...?)]
