  2:  149| [45] [----]
  3:  154| [45] [--]
  4:  162| [47] [Ena]
  5:  165| [45] ["--sagi..."]
  6:  173| [47] [Ena]
  7:  176| [45] ["Hey, hang in there, Captain Kasasagi."]
  8:  184| [47] [Watase]
  9:  187| [45] ["Ugh..."]
 10:  192| [45] [Watase awoke to the sound of someone calling his name.]
 11:  285| [45] [--When he came to his senses, he noticed he was lying on the floor of the elevator hall.]
 12:  313| [47] [Ena]
 13:  316| [45] ["Oh, you're awake! Thank God...!"]
 14:  321| [45] [Ena stared at Watase's face with a look of worry.]
 15:  388| [47] [Watase]
 16:  391| [45] ["T-Teach...?"]
 17:  396| [45] [Watase tried to sit up, only for a sharp pain to shoot through both his head and back.]
 18:  419| [47] [Watase]
 19:  422| [45] ["Oww!"]
 20:  450| [47] [Ena]
 21:  453| [45] ["Ah, you shouldn't push yourself! You only just regained consciousness after suffering that concussion!"]
 22:  461| [47] [Watase]
 23:  464| [45] ["R-right..."]
 24:  479| [45] [Watase nodded weakly-- and then noticed that there was a soft sensation against his head.]
 25:  487| [47] [Watase]
 26:  490| [45] ["... Uh, hey, Teach, are you..."]
 27:  518| [47] [Ena]
 28:  521| [45] ["Letting you rest your head in my lap? Why yes. Should I not have?"]
 29:  529| [47] [Watase]
 30:  532| [45] ["Well, no, that's not what I mean, it's just... why?"]
 31:  560| [47] [Ena]
 32:  563| [45] ["Because I'd feel bad if I made someone with a head injury lie on the cold, hard floor."]
 33:  591| [47] [Ena]
 34:  594| [45] ["... Though maybe that's not the best way to deal with this. If you don't like it,%Nthen I'll stop, just say the word."]
 35:  602| [47] [Watase]
 36:  605| [45] ["N-no... I'll take you up on that offer."]
 37:  610| [45] [It was a little embarrassing, but he had no reason to refuse.]
 38:  615| [45] [A question then came to his mind.]
 39:  623| [47] [Watase]
 40:  626| [45] ["... By the way, where are we?"]
 41:  654| [45] [Watase nodded feebly and surveyed his surroundings.]
 42:  662| [47] [Watase]
 43:  665| [45] ["... Where are we?"]
 44:  674| [47] [Ena]
 45:  677| [45] ["We're in that elevator hall in Area 6's inner ring."]
 46:  705| [47] [Ena]
 47:  708| [45] ["Do you remember falling from the ladder?"]
 48:  716| [47] [Watase]
 49:  719| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 50:  724| [45] [As he said that, he recalled that he'd grabbed onto the ladder before he'd smashed into the ground.]
 51:  729| [45] [It seemed that action had slowed his momentum down enough to keep him from getting severely injured.]
 52:  737| [47] [Watase]
 53:  740| [45] ["... How long was I out?"]
 54:  768| [47] [Ena]
 55:  771| [45] ["Just a few minutes."]
 56:  779| [47] [Watase]
 57:  782| [45] ["I see... where's the old man?"]
 58:  787| [45] [Ukita was nowhere to be seen. Ena answered with a bitter look on her face.]
 59:  795| [47] [Ena]
 60:  798| [45] ["He said he'd continue the search, so I gave him a Procyon and let him go on ahead."]
 61:  806| [47] [Watase]
 62:  809| [45] ["Wait... by himself?"]
 63:  818| [47] [Ena]
 64:  821| [45] ["We're in that elevator hall in Area 6's inner ring."]
 65:  847| [47] [Ena]
 66:  850| [45] ["Do you remember falling from the ladder?"]
 67:  858| [47] [Watase]
 68:  861| [45] ["Y-yeah..."]
 69:  866| [45] [As he said that, he recalled that he'd grabbed onto the ladder before he'd smashed into the ground.]
 70:  871| [45] [It seemed that action had slowed his momentum down enough to keep him from getting severely injured.]
 71:  879| [47] [Watase]
 72:  882| [45] ["... How long was I out?"]
 73:  908| [47] [Ena]
 74:  911| [45] ["Just a few minutes."]
 75:  919| [47] [Watase]
 76:  922| [45] ["I see... where's the old man?"]
 77:  927| [45] [Ukita was nowhere to be seen. Ena answered with a bitter look on her face.]
 78:  935| [47] [Ena]
 79:  938| [45] ["He said he'd continue the search, so I gave him a Procyon and let him go on ahead."]
 80:  946| [47] [Watase]
 81:  949| [45] ["Wait... by himself?"]
 82:  988| [45] [Watase sat up on instinct. Ena then replied to him calmly.]
 83:  996| [47] [Ena]
 84:  999| [45] ["That's right. He should be heading towards Area 1."]
 85: 1007| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1010| [45] ["Then you should have left me behind and gone with him."]
 87: 1036| [47] [Ena]
 88: 1039| [45] ["There's no way in hell I could have done that. And besides..."]
 89: 1111| [47] [Ena]
 90: 1114| [45] ["I really don't like being all alone with Mr. Ukita."]
 91: 1122| [47] [Watase]
 92: 1125| [45] ["Huh? What do you mean... by that?"]
 93: 1130| [45] [Ena's face clouded over at that question.]
 94: 1156| [47] [Ena]
 95: 1159| [45] ["He seems kind of dangerous... surely you've noticed that too."]
 96: 1185| [47] [Ena]
 97: 1188| [45] ["It feels like he's changed ever since he saw that body by the lift..."]
 98: 1204| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1207| [45] ["That's... he's gotta be scared out of his mind, that's all."]
100: 1215| [47] [Watase]
101: 1218| [45] ["I mean, not only did he get caught up in an accident in his own workplace, but then a girl as young as that turns up dead... it's no surprise."]
102: 1244| [47] [Ena]
103: 1247| [45] ["Being scared out of his mind has nothing to do with my problem with him."]
104: 1255| [47] [Ena]
105: 1258| [45] ["Why don't you find it strange?"]
106: 1266| [47] [Watase]
107: 1269| [45] ["I get what you're trying to say... but keep it to yourself."]
108: 1277| [47] [Watase]
109: 1280| [45] ["The old man's still one of us, right? He's been through the same things we have."]
110: 1291| [47] [Watase]
111: 1294| [45] ["... True, maybe it is strange."]
112: 1302| [47] [Watase]
113: 1305| [45] ["But keep it to yourself... I mean, the old man's still one of us, right? He's been through the same things we have."]
114: 1331| [47] [Ena]
115: 1334| [45] ["One of us, huh..."]
116: 1339| [45] [Ena locked eyes with Watase, lowering her voice.]
117: 1347| [47] [Ena]
118: 1350| [45] ["... I don't know if we should continue believing that."]
119: 1358| [47] [Watase]
120: 1361| [45] ["What?"]
121: 1387| [47] [Ena]
122: 1390| [45] ["I get the feeling he's hiding way too much from us..."]
123: 1398| [47] [Ena]
124: 1401| [45] ["You might get mad when you hear me say this, but my doubts about him are just getting worse and worse."]
125: 1409| [47] [Watase]
126: 1412| [45] ["...!"]
127: 1438| [47] [Ena]
128: 1441| [45] ["Hey, didn't Mr. Ukita say that you and he had met before you lost your memories?"]
129: 1449| [47] [Watase]
130: 1452| [45] ["Y-yeah. I mean, he said it, so it must be true."]
131: 1478| [47] [Ena]
132: 1481| [45] ["Are you sure you don't remember anything about him...?"]
133: 1486| [45] [Watase searched through his memories, but--]
134: 1494| [47] [Watase]
135: 1497| [45] ["... I'm sorry. I still don't remember anything about that part."]
136: 1505| [47] [Watase]
137: 1508| [45] ["Apparently I took his security card and locked him in Area 3. That's all I know."]
138: 1513| [45] [Watase had done that to make sure that Ukita, who had been panicking from the Case N announcement, didn't do anything rash.]
139: 1518| [45] [Perhaps Ukita still held a grudge against him for that--]
140: 1544| [47] [Ena]
141: 1547| [45] ["Honestly, I found that strange too. I have doubts that's something one would do."]
142: 1573| [47] [Ena]
143: 1576| [45] ["Instead... what do you think of this idea?"]
144: 1584| [47] [Ena]
145: 1587| [45] ["'During the rescue effort, you found Mr. Ukita to have been acting suspiciously.%NAs a precautionary measure, you proceeded to restrain him'."]
146: 1595| [47] [Watase]
147: 1598| [45] ["...!"]
148: 1603| [45] [Watase's eyes widened at Ena's theory.]
149: 1608| [47] [Watase]
150: 1609| [45] [(I-I never considered that...!)]
151: 1614| [45] [But it most certainly was possible.]
152: 1619| [47] [Watase]
153: 1620| [45] [(If her theory's correct, then that means the truth was buried in darkness once I lost my memories after that.)]
154: 1625| [47] [Watase]
155: 1626| [45] [(The old man then took that opportunity to play innocent and join up with us with the ultimate goal of escaping...!?)]
156: 1631| [45] [Watase quickly stopped his train of thought there.]
157: 1639| [47] [Watase]
158: 1642| [45] ["No, but... I don't want to consider that."]
159: 1668| [47] [Ena]
160: 1671| [45] ["Huh?"]
161: 1679| [47] [Watase]
162: 1682| [45] ["Even if the old man was indeed up to something at the time of the accident and acting suspiciously--"]
163: 1690| [47] [Watase]
164: 1693| [45] ["Restraining him and locking him in Area 3 just isn't part of a rescue worker's job, right?"]
165: 1701| [47] [Ena]
166: 1704| [45] ["... 'Not part of a rescue worker's job'?"]
167: 1712| [47] [Watase]
168: 1715| [45] ["That's right. A rescue worker's job is to save lives."]
169: 1723| [47] [Watase]
170: 1726| [45] ["Willingly trapping someone in a burning facility is out of the question."]
171: 1734| [47] [Watase]
172: 1737| [45] ["I have amnesia and even I know that much."]
173: 1763| [47] [Ena]
174: 1766| [45] ["..."]
175: 1776| [55] [√After Chapter 5]
176: 1782| [45] [Ena stared at Watase's face for a moment-- then let out an exasperated sigh.]
177: 1808| [47] [Ena]
178: 1811| [45] ["... You're way too naive."]
179: 1819| [47] [Watase]
180: 1822| [45] ["Hmph, call it whatever you want."]
181: 1830| [47] [Watase]
182: 1833| [45] ["But even if the old man was plotting something, I'd still save him if he was in trouble."]
183: 1859| [47] [Ena]
184: 1862| [45] ["... So simple-minded. Is that your rescue worker brain talking?"]
185: 1870| [47] [Watase]
186: 1873| [45] ["Yeah. Hate to break it to you, but this way apparently suits me better than doubting others."]
187: 1881| [47] [Watase]
188: 1884| [45] ["Wouldn't it be better for you to finally stop being so distrustful?"]
189: 1892| [47] [Watase]
190: 1895| [45] ["I believe that the most valuable asset we have in this horrible crisis... is teamwork."]
191: 1900| [45] [Ena grew silent for a moment after Watase finished his plea--%Nthen she soon spoke up in a defeated voice.]
192: 1926| [47] [Ena]
193: 1929| [45] ["... All right. I'm sorry. I guess I was jumping at shadows a bit."]
194: 1937| [47] [Watase]
195: 1940| [45] ["Good. Then now that you've had a change in heart..."]
196: 1948| [47] [Watase]
197: 1951| [45] ["It's too dangerous to be separated in these circumstances. Let's catch up with the old man."]
198: 1977| [47] [Ena]
199: 1980| [45] ["You sure you can walk?"]
200: 1988| [47] [Watase]
201: 1991| [45] ["Don't worry, I'm all better now. Let's get a move on."]
202: 2017| [47] [Ena]
203: 2020| [45] ["All right... but boy, you really are a tough one, aren't you?"]
204: 2025| [45] [Watase and Ena ran off towards Area 1 to find Ukita.]
205: 2168| [45] [They ran through the entire hallway, but he was nowhere to be found.]
206: 2230| [47] [Ena]
207: 2233| [45] ["I guess he already went to Area 2..."]
208: 2241| [47] [Ena]
209: 2244| [45] ["That was a waste of time. Let's just move on."]
210: 2259| [47] [Watase]
211: 2262| [45] ["You're right."]
212: 2267| [45] [Watase nodded in agreement and headed for Area 2.]
213: 2276| [45] [Watase disagreed.]
214: 2284| [47] [Watase]
215: 2287| [45] ["No, let's at least do a quick search of this area, just to be safe."]
216: 2313| [47] [Ena]
217: 2316| [45] ["Huh? But doesn't the fact that Mr. Ukita's not here mean that he already finished his search?"]
218: 2324| [47] [Watase]
219: 2327| [45] ["For all we know, we just didn't see him."]
220: 2353| [47] [Ena]
221: 2356| [45] ["... Well, if that's how you feel, then sure, okay..."]
222: 2399| [45] [Once Ena reluctantly agreed, she and Watase proceeded to search Area 1.]
223: 2404| [45] [But they didn't find him, either on B1 or on B2.]
224: 2472| [47] [Ena]
225: 2475| [45] ["... See? He's clearly not here. We really should just get moving."]
226: 2483| [47] [Watase]
227: 2486| [45] ["Mmm... I guess you're right."]
228: 2491| [45] [Watase finally gave in and headed for Area 2.]
