  0:   65| [45] [--Salyu felt as if she were rocking in a cradle.]
  1:   70| [45] [She heard the sound of a car engine.]
  2:  125| [45] [And eventually, she heard the professor's voice as well.]
  3:  146| [47] [Miyoko]
  4:  149| [45] ["--Yui. Yui."]
  5:  154| [47] [Salyu]
  6:  157| [45] ["... Mmm..."]
  7:  162| [47] [Miyoko]
  8:  165| [45] ["We're here."]
  9:  170| [47] [Salyu]
 10:  173| [45] ["... I see."]
 11:  184| [45] [Once Salyu answered, the car stopped.]
 12:  189| [47] [Miyoko]
 13:  192| [45] ["Let's get off now."]
 14:  323| [45] [As she got out of the car, a never-before-seen sight spread out before her eyes.]
 15:  328| [45] [A gentle breeze caressed Salyu's cheek.]
 16:  333| [45] [The professor stood next to her and spoke.]
 17:  359| [47] [Miyoko]
 18:  362| [45] ["You slept well."]
 19:  367| [47] [Salyu]
 20:  370| [45] ["... I had a dream."]
 21:  396| [47] [Miyoko]
 22:  399| [45] ["A dream?"]
 23:  404| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  407| [45] ["Yes, a dream. Of when I was at home in France... Those barren, ashen days."]
 25:  412| [47] [Salyu]
 26:  415| [45] ["... Nothing had happened, but it felt like a very sad dream."]
 27:  441| [47] [Miyoko]
 28:  444| [45] ["Don't worry, Yui. There's no need for you to return to that estate anymore."]
 29:  470| [47] [Miyoko]
 30:  473| [45] ["Starting today, you live here in Rokumei City."]
 31:  478| [45] [Salyu had heard that her parents and the professor had held a discussion.]
 32:  483| [45] [They concluded that Salyu would temporarily be put under the custody of the professor and live in her hometown.]
 33:  509| [47] [Miyoko]
 34:  512| [45] ["I'm sorry that you have to live in an unfamiliar land, but I don't think you'll feel uncomfortable here."]
 35:  517| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  520| [45] ["But there's something I have to do, isn't there?"]
 37:  546| [47] [Miyoko]
 38:  549| [45] ["Good, you remembered."]
 39:  554| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  557| [45] ["Of course. More importantly, I want you to go over my role again."]
 41:  583| [47] [Miyoko]
 42:  586| [45] ["Your role here is to protect my son, Natsuhiko Tenkawa."]
 43:  591| [47] [Salyu]
 44:  594| [45] ["From what?"]
 45:  620| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  623| [45] ["From all kinds of malicious intent. Lately, this town's public order has been going bad..."]
 47:  631| [47] [Miyoko]
 48:  634| [45] ["Though it might still be better compared to how it was a long in the past."]
 49:  639| [47] [Salyu]
 50:  642| [45] ["What happened in the past?"]
 51:  668| [47] [Miyoko]
 52:  671| [45] ["There were anti-BC demonstrations and anti-Communicator persecution even in a city like this."]
 53:  679| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  682| [45] ["Afterwards, Communicator residences were the target of direct destructive activity."]
 55:  690| [47] [Miyoko]
 56:  693| [45] ["And the targeted homes were partially destroyed... and some people even died."]
 57:  698| [47] [Salyu]
 58:  701| [45] ["Oh. But it looks like such a peaceful city."]
 59:  727| [47] [Miyoko]
 60:  730| [45] ["It took 16 years for it to get this far, though."]
 61:  738| [47] [Miyoko]
 62:  741| [45] ["But not even the strongest fortification can guarantee perfect safety. This town has several holes."]
 63:  767| [47] [Miyoko]
 64:  770| [45] ["As a Rank S Aptitude Communicator, Natsuhiko is at a higher risk of danger than other Communicators."]
 65:  796| [47] [Miyoko]
 66:  799| [45] ["But I cannot stay with him at all times... So I want you to protect Natsuhiko for me, Yui."]
 67:  804| [47] [Salyu]
 68:  807| [45] ["Roger."]
 69:  833| [47] [Miyoko]
 70:  836| [45] ["Thank you. Now, there's one key thing you need to know."]
 71:  862| [47] [Miyoko]
 72:  865| [45] ["Due to childhood trauma, Natsuhiko keeps seeing a phantom of his childhood friend who died."]
 73:  873| [47] [Miyoko]
 74:  876| [45] ["Her name was 'Yuuri Kotono'."]
 75:  881| [47] [Salyu]
 76:  884| [45] ["Yuuri... Kotono..."]
 77:  889| [45] [For some reason, hearing that name made Salyu feel nostalgic.]
 78:  894| [45] [Indeed, the professor had talked to her about this topic before.]
 79:  920| [47] [Miyoko]
 80:  923| [45] ["When you speak with Natsuhiko, he might suddenly bring up that girl's name--"]
 81:  931| [47] [Miyoko]
 82:  934| [45] ["But don't touch on the subject. Just gently leave it alone."]
 83:  939| [47] [Salyu]
 84:  942| [45] ["I already understand the information concerning Yuuri Kotono. I intend to handle the subject with the utmost care."]
 85:  968| [47] [Miyoko]
 86:  971| [45] ["Yes, I have high expectations."]
 87:  976| [45] [The professor gently spoke.]
 88:  981| [45] [But Salyu did not understand what those expectations actually were.]
 89:  986| [45] [She was extremely poor at judging what was on people's minds based on facial expression and tone of voice.]
 90:  991| [47] [Salyu]
 91:  994| [45] ["... I really am anxious after all."]
 92:  999| [47] [Salyu]
 93: 1002| [45] ["I can't understand other people's minds or other forms of any worldly common sense."]
 94: 1007| [47] [Salyu]
 95: 1010| [45] ["Can someone like me properly care for your son?"]
 96: 1036| [47] [Miyoko]
 97: 1039| [45] ["I thought you might say that, so I prepared a present for you."]
 98: 1046| [45] [And with that, the professor took something out of the car trunk.]
 99: 1111| [45] [It appeared to be a stuffed ferret or some other similar animal.]
100: 1116| [47] [Salyu]
101: 1119| [45] ["... A stuffed animal?"]
102: 1127| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1130| [45] ["Not just any stuffed animal."]
104: 1138| [47] [Miyoko]
105: 1141| [45] ["This is an Atmosphere Reading Mascot System, or 'ARMS' for short."]
106: 1149| [47] [Miyoko]
107: 1152| [45] ["Its featured functionality is to give you estimates of emotions based on facial expression, speech, and conduct."]
108: 1181| [47] [Miyoko]
109: 1184| [45] ["It should serve as an important guide to help you live in the outside world."]
110: 1198| [45] [And with that explanation, the professor handed the so-called ARMS device to Salyu.]
111: 1203| [45] [A single thought ran through Salyu's head as she looked it over carefully.]
112: 1208| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1209| [45] [(Cute...)]
114: 1214| [45] [The soft texture of its fur was pleasant to touch.]
115: 1219| [45] [She hadn't had an interest in such things before then, but for some reason, she really took a liking to it.]
116: 1251| [47] [Miyoko]
117: 1254| [45] ["If you point ARMS' eyes towards someone's face, it will automatically scan their facial expression."]
118: 1262| [47] [Miyoko]
119: 1265| [45] ["And if ARMS cries happily, that person is happy."]
120: 1273| [47] [Miyoko]
121: 1276| [45] ["In addition to facial expressions, it's also able to analyze voices and behavior. It's quite good at forming judgments."]
122: 1281| [45] [ARMS cried when the professor said that.]
123: 1286| [47] [Alice]
124: 1289| [45] ["Kyuuu!!"]
125: 1294| [47] [Salyu]
126: 1297| [45] ["It cried happily... Professor, does that mean you're happy right now?"]
127: 1323| [47] [Miyoko]
128: 1326| [45] ["Yes. I'm happy because you seem to be happy too."]
129: 1331| [47] [Salyu]
130: 1334| [45] ["... Useful."]
131: 1360| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1363| [45] ["That's great. Looks like it's to your liking."]
133: 1368| [45] [The professor smiled and continued talking.]
134: 1394| [47] [Miyoko]
135: 1397| [45] ["Now then, there's a hotel nearby. You and I are staying there tonight."]
136: 1402| [47] [Salyu]
137: 1405| [45] ["We're not going to your house, Professor?"]
138: 1413| [47] [Miyoko]
139: 1416| [45] ["I think you might be bewildered at such a sudden change in environment... so let's acclimatize you gradually."]
140: 1421| [45] [And with that declaration, the professor took Salyu by the hand and began walking.]
141: 1484| [45] [The two of them walked through town.]
142: 1489| [45] [Once she saw a crowd of people larger than any she'd seen back home, Salyu's body began to tremble.]
143: 1494| [47] [Salyu]
144: 1495| [45] [(It's kind of... scary...)]
145: 1500| [47] [Salyu]
146: 1503| [45] ["... Um, Professor, are we at the hotel yet?"]
147: 1536| [47] [Miyoko]
148: 1539| [45] ["No, actually, I thought it'd be better to purchase some daily necessities for you at this shopping area first, so--"]
149: 1544| [45] [Right as the professor said that,]
150: 1549| [45] [a voice echoed in Salyu's head.]
151: 1614| [85] [{Get away from there, Mashiro!! There's gasoline!!}]
152: 1615| [86] [???]
153: 1616| [86] [{Get away from there, Mashiro!! There's gasoline!!}]
154: 1677| [47] [Salyu]
155: 1680| [45] ["!?"]
156: 1691| [45] [Salyu gasped at the sudden yell.]
157: 1696| [47] [Salyu]
158: 1699| [45] ["Professor, what was that?"]
159: 1704| [45] [When Salyu asked her that question-- the professor's face froze.]
160: 1712| [47] [Miyoko]
161: 1715| [45] ["W... was that...!?"]
162: 1723| [47] [Miyoko]
163: 1726| [45] ["It couldn't be-- Natsuhiko!?"]
164: 1731| [45] [The professor looked around in a panic.]
165: 1757| [47] [Miyoko]
166: 1760| [45] ["Have his abilities finally...!? No, more importantly...!"]
167: 1765| [47] [Salyu]
168: 1768| [45] ["Um, Professor?"]
169: 1794| [47] [Miyoko]
170: 1797| [45] ["Not good... If the upper brass catches wind of this..."]
171: 1802| [45] [The professor muttered to herself. She seemed so taken aback that she didn't even hear Salyu's words.]
172: 1813| [45] [Soon, the professor's PDA rang.]
173: 1836| [45] [She gasped and picked up.]
174: 1869| [47] [Miyoko]
175: 1872| [45] ["Yes. This is Tenkawa..."]
176: 1898| [47] [Miyoko]
177: 1901| [45] ["... Yes, I just perceived it as well. That was probably Special Observation Target Na2's telepathy..."]
178: 1927| [47] [Miyoko]
179: 1930| [45] ["... What measures? No, that's too hasty!"]
180: 1956| [47] [Miyoko]
181: 1959| [45] ["It was only telepathy, you know!? According to the PRC criteria--"]
182: 1964| [45] [The professor seemed to be arguing on the phone with someone.]
183: 2007| [45] [Salyu waited there for a while, but the call continued for 10, then 20 minutes without any sign of stopping.]
184: 2012| [47] [Salyu]
185: 2013| [45] [(Did some sort of problem happen...?)]
186: 2018| [45] [Salyu didn't understand a thing.]
187: 2061| [45] [Once she had grown bored of waiting, she eventually heard a crowd stirring across the street.]
188: 2066| [47] [Salyu]
189: 2067| [45] [(... I wonder what it is.)]
190: 2072| [45] [Salyu walked in the direction of the commotion, making sure not to get too far away from the professor.]
191: 2206| [45] [On the other side of the street, there was a car crashed into a street light.]
192: 2211| [45] [Apparently there was a motor vehicle accident. A fire engine could be seen approaching from the distance.]
193: 2297| [45] [And then in the midst of the crowd of onlookers-- Salyu's eyes fell on someone.]
194: 2302| [47] [Salyu]
195: 2303| [45] [(That boy is Dr. Tenkawa's son...?)]
196: 2308| [45] [That should've been the first time she saw him, yet for some reason, he looked familiar.]
197: 2313| [45] [Had the professor shown her a picture of him before?]
198: 2336| [45] [At that time, he too turned Salyu's way.]
199: 2398| [45] [Their eyes met and locked.]
200: 2403| [47] [Alice]
201: 2406| [45] ["Kyuu kyuu! Kyuu kyuu!"]
202: 2411| [45] [And just then, ARMS started violently squeaking like an alarm bell.]
203: 2416| [47] [Salyu]
204: 2417| [45] [(Oh no, does he see me as hostile...?)]
205: 2465| [45] [Salyu became frightened again and quickly fled.]
206: 2534| [45] [When she got back to where the professor was, the phone call was just about over.]
207: 2542| [47] [Miyoko]
208: 2545| [45] ["... Yes. Yes. Understood. Then we'll go with that..."]
209: 2550| [45] [The professor sighed and hung up.]
210: 2555| [45] [Once she noticed Salyu, she spoke to her.]
211: 2587| [47] [Miyoko]
212: 2590| [45] ["... Sorry about the wait."]
213: 2595| [47] [Salyu]
214: 2598| [45] ["Finished with the phone?"]
215: 2624| [47] [Miyoko]
216: 2627| [45] ["... Looks like things are about to get busy, but... I'm okay. Don't worry about me."]
217: 2653| [47] [Miyoko]
218: 2656| [45] ["Please don't mention that phone call just now to Natsuhiko when you meet him, okay?"]
219: 2661| [47] [Salyu]
220: 2664| [45] ["? ... I don't understand, but okay."]
221: 2690| [47] [Miyoko]
222: 2693| [45] ["Thank you. Anyway, let's go to the hotel. I'll take care of the shopping later."]
223: 2698| [45] [The professor grasped Salyu's hand and started walking again.]
224: 2703| [45] [Along the way, Salyu asked the professor a question.]
225: 2708| [47] [Salyu]
226: 2711| [45] ["By the way, Professor, back to what we were talking about..."]
227: 2737| [47] [Miyoko]
228: 2740| [45] ["Huh?"]
229: 2745| [47] [Salyu]
230: 2748| [45] ["The matter about protecting your son. Why choose me for that role?"]
231: 2753| [47] [Salyu]
232: 2756| [45] ["Someone with your position and assets should be able to employ as many capable bodyguards as you'd like. So why choose just me?"]
233: 2761| [45] [The professor quietly answered Salyu's question.]
234: 2787| [47] [Miyoko]
235: 2790| [45] ["I wanted to give you a role."]
236: 2795| [47] [Salyu]
237: 2798| [45] ["... A role?"]
238: 2806| [47] [Miyoko]
239: 2809| [45] ["Yes, a role."]
240: 2835| [47] [Miyoko]
241: 2838| [45] ["It's not just for my son's sake. It's for yours as well."]
242: 2846| [47] [Miyoko]
243: 2849| [45] ["Both Natsuhiko's mind and yours are lacking in some areas. But that's exactly why you can complete each other."]
244: 2875| [47] [Miyoko]
245: 2878| [45] ["I have high hopes for you, Yui. Hopes that you can give Natsuhiko what I cannot."]
246: 2886| [47] [Miyoko]
247: 2889| [45] ["Hopes that Natsuhiko can give you what I cannot."]
248: 2894| [47] [Salyu]
249: 2897| [45] ["...? I don't understand."]
250: 2923| [47] [Miyoko]
251: 2926| [45] ["I know... But I'm sure one day you will."]
252: 2952| [47] [Miyoko]
253: 2955| [45] ["Once you've fulfilled your role, your void will be filled."]
254: 2960| [45] [The professor spoke with a smile.]
255: 3044| [45] [Salyu didn't understand the professor's true intentions-- but that one word resonated strongly with her mind.]
256: 3049| [47] [Salyu]
257: 3050| [45] [(A "role", huh...)]
258: 3055| [45] [She didn't understand why she was so fascinated by something as boring as bodyguard work.]
259: 3060| [45] [But Salyu was aware... that it was something she had longed for.]
260: 3065| [47] [Salyu]
261: 3066| [45] [(I'm not confident I can do it... but I'll try my best.)]
