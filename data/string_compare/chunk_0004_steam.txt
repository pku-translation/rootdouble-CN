  1:  180| [47] [Man]
  2:  183| [45] ["Hold on! I'll save you!"]
  3:  234| [45] [The man screamed this and was about to rush into the flames--%Nbut was interrupted by someone grabbing him by the collar.]
  4:  292| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
  5:  295| [45] ["Captain! You can't just rush in blindly like that!"]
  6:  303| [47] [Man]
  7:  306| [45] ["But if we don't do something quick, that girl will--"]
  8:  332| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
  9:  335| [45] ["I'll take care of it!"]
 10:  340| [45] [Once he heard her say this, the man--]
 11:  355| [47] [Man]
 12:  358| [45] ["... Got it, I'm counting on you!"]
 13:  363| [45] [Gave that answer instinctively. He felt more at ease leaving it up to her.]
 14:  389| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 15:  392| [45] ["Alrighty, leave this to me!"]
 16:  397| [45] [The female rescue worker quickly brushed the man aside, dashing into the room.]
 17:  408| [47] [Man]
 18:  411| [45] ["No, leave this to me!"]
 19:  492| [45] [Quickly gave this reply.]
 20:  551| [45] [But just as he was about to continue running, the blaze in front of him flared up violently.]
 21:  556| [47] [Man]
 22:  557| [45] [(...!!)]
 23:  586| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 24:  589| [45] ["Ah geez, this is why we told you to rest!"]
 25:  615| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 26:  618| [45] ["You're just gonna get in the way if you can't even walk straight!"]
 27:  633| [47] [Man]
 28:  636| [45] ["S-sorry! You were right-- you should take care of this!"]
 29:  662| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 30:  665| [45] ["On it!"]
 31:  670| [45] [The female rescue worker quickly brushed the man aside, dashing into the room.]
 32:  684| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 33:  687| [45] ["Lieutenant, back me up with the hose!"]
 34:  713| [47] [Lieutenant]
 35:  716| [45] ["Roger!"]
 36:  824| [45] [The lieutenant pointed the hose upwards.]
 37:  829| [45] [The jetstream shattered apart when it hit the ceiling, scattering into a spray.]
 38:  953| [45] [The female rescue worker then ran into the room, as if clad in that water.]
 39:  958| [47] [Man]
 40:  959| [45] [(What an amazing technique--!)]
 41:  964| [45] [It was perfect teamwork.]
 42:  969| [45] [The female rescue worker then ran up to the girl through the mist and steam--]
 43: 1131| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 44: 1134| [45] ["Aw yeah! Survivor secured!"]
 45: 1139| [45] [And shouted triumphantly.]
 46: 1144| [45] [That dramatic rescue had happened in the blink of an eye.]
 47: 1242| [45] [--A few minutes later, once the roaring inferno had been doused--]
 48: 1322| [45] [The rescue workers tended to the girl they'd saved.]
 49: 1348| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 50: 1351| [45] ["Don't worry miss, you're safe now."]
 51: 1377| [47] [Lieutenant]
 52: 1380| [45] ["Are you hurt?"]
 53: 1408| [47] [Girl]
 54: 1411| [45] ["... N-no."]
 55: 1416| [45] [The man stood a short distance away, observing them.]
 56: 1421| [47] [Man]
 57: 1422| [45] ["..."]
 58: 1427| [45] [In the end, he'd been completely useless-- both at putting out the fires and at saving her.]
 59: 1432| [45] [So he figured the least he could do was talk to her.]
 60: 1440| [47] [Man]
 61: 1443| [45] ["Umm... er, well, I'm glad you're okay."]
 62: 1504| [47] [Girl]
 63: 1507| [45] ["!?"]
 64: 1530| [45] [Another frightened look engulfed the girl's face at that moment.]
 65: 1556| [47] [Lieutenant]
 66: 1559| [45] ["...? Did you do something, Captain?"]
 67: 1567| [47] [Man]
 68: 1570| [45] ["Huh? No, nothing, honest..."]
 69: 1596| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 70: 1599| [45] ["Try not to scare her, okay? Your face is already scary enough as it is."]
 71: 1607| [47] [Man]
 72: 1610| [45] ["Oh, uh... sorry. Guess I gave you a little shock there."]
 73: 1618| [47] [Man]
 74: 1621| [45] ["But you can take it easy now. We're on your side. We came here to save you."]
 75: 1629| [47] [Man]
 76: 1632| [45] ["... Probably."]
 77: 1690| [45] [The girl's body shook with a start upon hearing that.]
 78: 1716| [47] [Lieutenant]
 79: 1719| [45] ["Captain! Why would you ever say something like that?"]
 80: 1745| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 81: 1748| [45] ["Yeah, you've been acting weird ever since you woke up."]
 82: 1774| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 83: 1777| [45] ["Not knowing what's going on is one thing, but you've been no help at all either."]
 84: 1785| [47] [Man]
 85: 1788| [45] ["S-sorry..."]
 86: 1793| [45] [After giving a brief apology, the man fired off another question.]
 87: 1801| [47] [Man]
 88: 1804| [45] ["By the way, can I ask you guys a question?"]
 89: 1812| [47] [Man]
 90: 1815| [45] ["You've been calling me 'Captain'... so does that mean I'm the captain of a rescue squad or something?"]
 91: 1841| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
 92: 1844| [45] ["Huh? The heck you talking about?"]
 93: 1870| [47] [Lieutenant]
 94: 1873| [45] ["What... do you mean by that?"]
 95: 1878| [45] [The man thought hard once he heard their surprised answers.]
 96: 1883| [45] [But as he'd feared, he couldn't locate any information about himself in his head.]
 97: 1891| [47] [Man]
 98: 1894| [45] ["Well, the thing is... I don't know anything."]
 99: 1902| [47] [Man]
100: 1905| [45] ["Not who I am, or even where I am..."]
101: 1962| [47] [All 3]
102: 1965| [45] ["Huh!?"]
103: 1970| [45] [The women's faces twitched at that proclamation.]
104: 1996| [47] [Lieutenant]
105: 1999| [45] ["Y-you don't mean..."]
106: 2025| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
107: 2028| [45] ["You've got amnesia...?"]
108: 2080| [45] [--Amnesia.]
109: 2085| [45] [The man mulled over that word.]
110: 2090| [47] [Man]
111: 2091| [45] [(So that's what it is...?)]
112: 2096| [45] [But for some illogical reason, the answer "no, that's not it" suddenly popped into his head.]
113: 2101| [47] [Man]
114: 2102| [45] [(It's more like... my mind's denying me the right to think about who I am...)]
115: 2107| [45] [It was a strange feeling.]
116: 2112| [45] [But since it didn't look like he could explain what'd happened to him very well, he reluctantly decided to go with their suggestion.]
117: 2130| [47] [Man]
118: 2133| [45] ["... Y-yeah... I guess you -would- call this amnesia..."]
119: 2159| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
120: 2162| [45] ["C-c'mon Captain, quit pulling our legs!"]
121: 2170| [47] [Man]
122: 2173| [45] ["No, I really wish I -was- joking...!"]
123: 2199| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
124: 2202| [45] ["Wait... you mean you're totally serious!?"]
125: 2228| [47] [Lieutenant]
126: 2231| [45] ["P-please hold on a moment, Captain! Did you hurt your head by any chance!?"]
127: 2239| [47] [Man]
128: 2242| [45] ["My head...? Now that you mention it, I did have this really bad headache a few minutes ago..."]
129: 2268| [47] [Lieutenant]
130: 2271| [45] ["I knew it...! There's a possibility that you hit your head on something."]
131: 2297| [47] [Lieutenant]
132: 2300| [45] ["That's probably why you're feeling so dazed and having trouble remembering things.%NThen that means your memories should return in time."]
133: 2308| [47] [Man]
134: 2311| [45] ["I-is that how it works?"]
135: 2338| [47] [Lieutenant]
136: 2341| [45] ["Yes. It appears that retrograde amnesia caused by physical trauma goes away fairly quickly on its own without requiring any particular treatment in most cases."]
137: 2346| [45] [The lieutenant calmly explained that as she threw around a few technical terms here and there.]
138: 2354| [47] [Man]
139: 2357| [45] ["... Then you're saying this is only temporary?"]
140: 2383| [47] [Lieutenant]
141: 2386| [45] ["Yes. But if you suffered brain damage by any chance, it's possible that your amnesia could be permanent."]
142: 2412| [47] [Lieutenant]
143: 2415| [45] ["And I believe there have been a few cases where death occurs if the brain damage is left untreated."]
144: 2423| [47] [Man]
145: 2426| [45] ["...!"]
146: 2431| [45] [The man felt a shudder run through him at those words.]
147: 2457| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
148: 2460| [45] ["What the hell? That's horrible...!"]
149: 2486| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
150: 2489| [45] ["Captain, how bad is your headache? Do you feel like throwing up?"]
151: 2497| [47] [Man]
152: 2500| [45] ["No... my head doesn't hurt at all right now, and my stomach feels fine."]
153: 2526| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
154: 2529| [45] ["Th-then I guess he's in the clear?"]
155: 2555| [47] [Lieutenant]
156: 2558| [45] ["No, we can't be sure of that just yet. If you'll please bear with me for a moment, Captain."]
157: 2668| [45] [The woman grabbed the man by the arm, rolled up his sleeve, and looked at his wrist.]
158: 2673| [45] [He hadn't noticed it until that moment, but he had some kind of wristband-like object wrapped around it.]
159: 2681| [47] [Man]
160: 2684| [45] ["What's this?"]
161: 2785| [47] [Lieutenant]
162: 2788| [45] ["It's called a 'Vital Checker'. It automatically diagnoses the wearer's health."]
163: 2793| [45] [A closer look revealed there were several numerical readings and five green lights on the device.]
164: 2835| [47] [Lieutenant]
165: 2838| [45] ["--Status all green. No issues with your pulse, blood pressure, or anything else... you're completely healthy."]
166: 2885| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
167: 2888| [45] ["Then it looks like we don't have to worry about him dropping dead or anything like that for now, right...?"]
168: 2914| [47] [Lieutenant]
169: 2917| [45] ["But we can't be optimistic about that without an expert's opinion.%NPlease get yourself a proper examination and treatment later."]
170: 2923| [45] [The female rescue worker's eyes widened as soon as she heard the lieutenant's reply.]
171: 2955| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
172: 2958| [45] ["... Oh crap! Almost forgot!"]
173: 2984| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
174: 2987| [45] ["Lieutenant, we need to give this girl some 'AD' fast!"]
175: 2992| [45] [The lieutenant's face froze at those words.]
176: 3018| [47] [Lieutenant]
177: 3021| [45] ["Oh no! How could I have been so careless...!?"]
178: 3026| [45] [The lieutenant wasted no time in taking something out of her pocket.]
179: 3112| [45] [It was an ampule loaded in a transparent container.]
180: 3157| [45] [The lieutenant turned it towards the girl and spoke.]
181: 3165| [47] [Lieutenant]
182: 3168| [45] ["Please hold out your arm."]
183: 3194| [47] [Girl]
184: 3197| [45] ["N-no... I don't want that shot..."]
185: 3223| [47] [Lieutenant]
186: 3226| [45] ["You can't be like that! You'll be in grave danger without it!"]
187: 3231| [45] [The girl turned around and tried to run, but the lieutenant grabbed her before she could.]
188: 3236| [45] [She then rolled up the girl's sleeve without giving her a chance to speak and pushed the tip of the ampule into the girl, injecting her with its contents.]
189: 3268| [47] [Girl]
190: 3271| [45] ["Aah...!"]
191: 3276| [45] [The girl's eyes widened and her body trembled.]
192: 3281| [45] [Feeling rather unnerved by her reaction, the man spoke up.]
193: 3334| [47] [Man]
194: 3337| [45] ["... What's that drug?"]
195: 3363| [47] [Lieutenant]
196: 3366| [45] ["It's called AD. Put in simple terms--"]
197: 3374| [47] [Lieutenant]
198: 3377| [45] ["It's an 'anti-radiation' drug."]
199: 3389| [45] [The man felt an ominous echo in those words.]
200: 3397| [47] [Man]
201: 3400| [45] ["... Did you say an anti-radiation drug...?"]
202: 3426| [47] [Lieutenant]
203: 3429| [45] ["Yes. It was given to us by members of this facility's staff for this mission."]
204: 3455| [47] [Lieutenant]
205: 3458| [45] ["We can't survive in here unless we keep injecting ourselves with this. Because--"]
206: 3463| [45] [The lieutenant surveyed her surroundings, then continued in a bitter voice.]
207: 3489| [47] [Lieutenant]
208: 3492| [45] ["--Because this facility is currently contaminated from top to bottom in radiation."]
209: 3500| [47] [Man]
210: 3503| [45] ["What!?"]
211: 3515| [45] [The bad feeling he'd gotten earlier only intensified with that statement.]
212: 3523| [47] [Man]
213: 3526| [45] ["H-hold on a sec... 'Radiation'? 'Contaminated'? What are you talking about!?"]
214: 3534| [47] [Man]
215: 3537| [45] ["What the hell kind of facility is this place!?"]
216: 3542| [45] [The lieutenant took a good hard look at the bewildered man--]
217: 3547| [45] [And followed up with a clear answer.]
218: 3580| [47] [Lieutenant]
219: 3583| [45] ["A nuclear energy research facility equipped with a small-scale nuclear reactor used for research purposes."]
220: 3591| [47] [Lieutenant]
221: 3594| [45] ["And nearly two hours ago, that very same reactor--"]
222: 3603| [47] [Lieutenant]
223: 3606| [45] ["Went through a 'meltdown'."]
224: 3618| [45] [Even though it was supposedly his first time hearing that word, it still managed to send shivers down the man's spine.]
225: 3626| [47] [Man]
226: 3629| [45] ["A-a meltdown...!?"]
227: 3655| [47] [Lieutenant]
228: 3658| [45] ["Simply put, it refers to when something causes a nuclear reactor to melt, resulting in the nuclear fuel inside leaking out."]
229: 3666| [47] [Lieutenant]
230: 3669| [45] ["It is an extremely serious accident that is frequently accompanied by explosions and fires--"]
231: 3696| [47] [Lieutenant]
232: 3699| [45] ["And it also spreads 'radiation' that has harsh negative effects on the human body.%NThe entire facility is currently contaminated with such radiation."]
233: 3707| [47] [Man]
234: 3710| [45] ["That can't be! You say this place is contaminated, but it doesn't look that way at all...!"]
235: 3718| [47] [Lieutenant]
236: 3721| [45] ["Radiation is odorless and invisible to the naked eye. But it's definitely there, eating away at our bodies."]
237: 3726| [45] [The lieutenant then took some sort of device out of her pocket.]
238: 3863| [47] [Lieutenant]
239: 3866| [45] ["This is a 'Procyon', a device for measuring radiation-- the reading it's currently showing is '1108 mSv per hour'."]
240: 3874| [47] [Lieutenant]
241: 3877| [45] ["This is approximately over 20 million times more radiation than what exists in nature."]
242: 3885| [47] [Man]
243: 3888| [45] ["20 million...!?"]
244: 3930| [47] [Lieutenant]
245: 3933| [45] ["Even under normal circumstances, there are faint levels of radiation in space and on the earth's surface, but the dosage is so low that it has almost no effect on the human body."]
246: 3941| [47] [Lieutenant]
247: 3944| [45] ["But when in a situation where you're exposed to such abnormally strong levels of radiation like the 1108 mSv surrounding us, it's known as 'radiation exposure'--"]
248: 3953| [47] [Lieutenant]
249: 3956| [45] ["Which causes severely negative effects on the human body."]
250: 3964| [47] [Lieutenant]
251: 3967| [45] ["This includes skin inflammation, nausea, organ failure, brain cell damage, vision impairment, neurological disorders, genetic disorders, and cancer."]
252: 3975| [47] [Man]
253: 3978| [45] ["...!"]
254: 3983| [45] [The lieutenant's matter-of-fact explanation caused all the hair on the man's body to stick up on their ends in fear.]
255: 3991| [47] [Lieutenant]
256: 3994| [45] ["--These health problems can occur when you're exposed to 100 mSv and above.%NMeaning that the levels we are being exposed to right now are particularly strong."]
257: 4024| [47] [Lieutenant]
258: 4027| [45] ["This environment is so deadly that we normally wouldn't be able to take even a single step in here."]
259: 4053| [47] [Lieutenant]
260: 4056| [45] ["And though some areas in this facility have less radiation than others, it's completely impossible to avoid exposure, no matter where you are."]
261: 4064| [47] [Man]
262: 4067| [45] ["W-we can't get away from it...!?"]
263: 4075| [47] [Man]
264: 4078| [45] ["Are you shitting me!? How the hell can you be so calm at a time like this!?"]
265: 4104| [47] [Lieutenant]
266: 4107| [45] ["Please wait! Please remain quiet until I've finished explaining!"]
267: 4112| [45] [The man instantly shut up at the lieutenant's firm voice.]
268: 4117| [45] [She gestured to the empty ampule in her hand and continued.]
269: 4282| [47] [Lieutenant]
270: 4285| [45] ["But this AD drug offers almost 100%% protection against the effects of radiation exposure-- granted that you're in an area with lower radiation levels, that is."]
271: 4293| [47] [Man]
272: 4296| [45] ["100%%!?"]
273: 4304| [47] [Lieutenant]
274: 4307| [45] ["This is no ordinary drug. It contains medical nanomachines that detoxify and expel the radiation received by the human body."]
275: 4315| [47] [Lieutenant]
276: 4318| [45] ["That said, it's only effective for a mere 60 minutes, and we don't have a lot of it either."]
277: 4339| [45] [Upon hearing her whole explanation, the man--]
278: 4351| [45] [Chose to trust her.]
279: 4359| [47] [Man]
280: 4362| [45] ["I-I see..."]
281: 4367| [45] [Everything he'd just heard felt so utterly unrealistic... but given how the lieutenant had said it all with a straight face, it was probably true.]
282: 4421| [45] [Found himself reluctant to trust her.]
283: 4429| [47] [Man]
284: 4432| [45] ["A drug that gives 100%% protection against radiation...? Are you for real!?"]
285: 4462| [47] [Lieutenant]
286: 4465| [45] ["I can understand why you're shocked."]
287: 4491| [47] [Lieutenant]
288: 4494| [45] ["But please trust me. This is a serious matter that concerns your life."]
289: 4509| [47] [Man]
290: 4512| [45] ["I... I see."]
291: 4517| [45] [It really did feel so utterly unrealistic... but given how serious the lieutenant sounded, he had no choice -but- to believe.]
292: 4536| [45] [But he suddenly felt a chill run through him.]
293: 4544| [47] [Man]
294: 4547| [45] ["Hey, uh, you sure we'll be okay without getting shots too?"]
295: 4573| [47] [Lieutenant]
296: 4576| [45] ["What do you mean? We only just injected ourselves right before we found you--"]
297: 4602| [47] [Lieutenant]
298: 4605| [45] ["...!?"]
299: 4610| [45] [The lieutenant and her subordinate gasped.]
300: 4653| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
301: 4656| [45] ["Oh yeah...! Captain, when was the last time you gave yourself some AD!?"]
302: 4664| [47] [Man]
303: 4667| [45] ["I-I don't know..."]
304: 4693| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
305: 4696| [45] ["Crap! You'd better inject yourself just to be safe! You should have some AD on you!"]
306: 4702| [45] [The man frantically searched his pockets and quickly found an ampule in one of them.]
307: 4749| [47] [Man]
308: 4752| [45] ["Found it!"]
309: 4760| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
310: 4763| [45] ["Using it's a piece of cake! It comes with its own cartridge, so just put it in that--"]
311: 4810| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
312: 4813| [45] ["Now all you've gotta do is break off the tip, put it against a vein, and then just press the end!"]
313: 4821| [47] [Man]
314: 4824| [45] ["L-like this!?"]
315: 4829| [45] [Urged on by the woman, the man loaded the ampule into the cartridge.]
316: 4860| [45] [Once he injected it, the fluid in the container entered his body, accompanied by the slight prickling pain that came with a shot.]
317: 4865| [45] [And at that moment, he felt like something had faded from his head.]
318: 4870| [47] [Man]
319: 4871| [45] [(What's this feeling... is it a side-effect of the drug?)]
320: 4897| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
321: 4900| [45] ["What's wrong, Captain? This means you're safe for now, so there shouldn't be a problem."]
322: 4908| [47] [Man]
323: 4911| [45] ["Safe..!?"]
324: 4916| [45] [The idea of feeling safe in this situation was totally insane to the man.]
325: 4921| [47] [Man]
326: 4922| [45] [(There's no way in hell I could accept a messed-up situation like this so easily...)]
327: 4927| [45] [He decided to try asking a question in an attempt to keep himself from worrying.]
328: 4935| [47] [Man]
329: 4938| [45] ["... H-hey, can I ask something?"]
330: 4946| [47] [Man]
331: 4949| [45] ["Just who am I, and what's happening right now?"]
332: 4957| [47] [Man]
333: 4960| [45] ["And, uh, right-- the exit... where's the exit to this facility!?"]
334: 4965| [45] [The lieutenant and her subordinate exchanged glances upon hearing his chain of questions.]
335: 4991| [47] [Female Rescue Worker]
336: 4994| [45] ["The 'exit', huh..."]
337: 5020| [47] [Lieutenant]
338: 5023| [45] ["... Then we'll take you to it now. I'll explain the situation to you on the way there."]
339: 5028| [45] [Their words seemed to carry a heavy weight to them.]
340: 5036| [47] [Man]
341: 5039| [45] ["...? Oh, thanks, I'd appreciate that."]
342: 5065| [47] [Lieutenant]
343: 5068| [45] ["Roger that. Then Captain, ma'am, this way please."]
344: 5109| [47] [Girl]
345: 5112| [45] ["O-okay..."]
346: 5117| [45] [The lieutenant started walking.]
347: 5122| [45] [The rest of the group soon followed after her.]
