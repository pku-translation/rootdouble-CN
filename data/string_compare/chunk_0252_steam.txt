  0:   39| [55] [√Current Chapter 2]
  1:   56| [45] [After Watase's team made another sweep of Area 5, they moved towards Area 6.]
  2:  102| [45] [And as they searched the inner ring, Ena suddenly spoke up.]
  3:  110| [47] [Ena]
  4:  113| [45] ["Oh... what's this?"]
  5:  173| [45] [Ena was pointing to a white board with the following message written on it:]
  6:  211| [45] [--From the tear rain to Altair and the bridge of bird wings--]
  7:  214| [85] [　]
  8:  217| [45] [Did you guys manage to escape?]
  9:  220| [45] [Or are you still here?]
 10:  223| [45] [I haven't found you after all my searching,%Nso perhaps you're long gone.]
 11:  226| [45] [But I'd like to reunite with you as soon as possible if you are indeed still here.]
 12:  229| [45] [If you guys are the ones reading this, then answer the following question:]
 13:  232| [85] [ %N]
 14:  235| [45] ["Was Sirius able to escape from his cage on that night of the full moon?"]
 15:  264| [47] [Watase]
 16:  267| [45] ["... The hell's this?"]
 17:  293| [47] [Ena]
 18:  296| [45] ["Mmm... it looks like a message from one person to another..."]
 19:  301| [45] [The two of them tilted their heads in confusion, but Natsuhiko alone understood the meaning of that message.]
 20:  388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  389| [45] [("From the tear rain to Altair and the bridge of bird wings"--)]
 22:  394| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  395| [45] [(That's a message from Salyu to me and Mashiro, isn't it!?)]
 24:  400| [45] [She wrote it in a cryptic way, perhaps as a way to prevent the terrorists from intercepting the message--]
 25:  405| [45] [Most likely, "tear rain" meant "Sairuiu"-- Salyu. "Altair" meant "Hikoboshi"-- Natsuhiko.%NThe bridge of "bird wings" meant "Toba"-- Mashiro.]
 26:  410| [45] ["Did you guys manage to escape?"]
 27:  415| [45] ["Or are you still here?"]
 28:  420| [45] ["... I'd like to reunite with you as soon as possible if you are indeed still here."]
 29:  425| [45] [Natsuhiko thought he felt his chest tighten as he read the message.]
 30:  430| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  431| [45] [(I'm sorry, Salyu...)]
 32:  436| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 33:  437| [45] [(Mashiro escaped to the surface, but me? I'm already...)]
 34:  442| [45] ["Was Sirius able to escape from his cage on that night of the full moon?"]
 35:  447| [45] [The answer to that was obviously "yes".]
 36:  452| [45] [That night, Natsuhiko and Mashiro did indeed successfully set Sirius free from the city.]
 37:  457| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  458| [45] [(But this time...)]
 39:  463| [45] [Natsuhiko was already dead.]
 40:  468| [45] [And now Salyu was trapped inside the same cage.]
 41:  473| [45] [Natsuhiko wanted to set Salyu free from this hell, no matter what the cost.]
 42:  478| [45] [Before his spirit faded away...]
 43:  483| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 44:  484| [45] [(... Salyu, please be safe.)]
 45:  550| [45] [--But shortly later, trouble occurred.]
 46:  562| [45] [While Watase was climbing the elevator shaft, one of the ladder's stairs broke off.]
 47:  574| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 48:  575| [45] [(U-uwaahh!)]
 49:  587| [45] [Immediately afterwards, an intense shock ran from Watase's back to the crown of his head, instantly robbing him of his consciousness--]
 50:  713| [45] [... --Once he woke up, only Ena was there.]
 51:  718| [45] [Watase and Ena resumed the search, chasing after Ukita who had gone ahead.]
 52:  723| [45] [But Ukita was already nowhere to be found.]
