  0:   69| [45] [--A long time passed after that.]
  1:   74| [45] [Salyu's voice echoed through her room.]
  2:  103| [47] [Salyu]
  3:  106| [45] ["... 195, 196, 197..."]
  4:  111| [45] [She was counting pushups.]
  5:  116| [47] [Salyu]
  6:  119| [45] ["... 200."]
  7:  124| [45] [Salyu finished her training and took a deep breath.]
  8:  129| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  132| [45] ["Phew..."]
 10:  137| [45] [Salyu thought to herself as she wiped off her sweat.]
 11:  142| [47] [Salyu]
 12:  143| [45] [(Exercise is good...)]
 13:  148| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  149| [45] [(If I move my body until it gets sore, it takes my mind off of unnecessary thoughts and I can really feel the results.)]
 15:  154| [45] [She finally became able to use the extensive physical techniques that had been written onto her brain.]
 16:  159| [45] [That said, she couldn't practice gymnastics or track-and-field techniques in the room.]
 17:  164| [45] [Salyu's favorites were things like simple muscle training and martial arts.]
 18:  169| [45] [The "kata" training methods in Japanese martial arts were particularly suitable for her needs since they allowed for the honing of one's combat skills even in the absence of a partner.]
 19:  174| [45] [She imagined enemies in front of her to fight.]
 20:  179| [45] [She had already fought countless times with these shadows.]
 21:  184| [45] [Recently, she had been fighting several of these enemies in quick succession. She could really feel herself getting stronger.]
 22:  189| [47] [Salyu]
 23:  190| [45] [(... Though of course, it's all meaningless in the end.)]
 24:  195| [45] [But as she was shut off from the world--]
 25:  200| [45] [Salyu had no proof of her own existence aside from animalistic responses like growth and fatigue.]
 26:  205| [45] [Training. Reading. Those two things had become Salyu's entire life.]
 27:  254| [45] [Salyu took a shower in the bathroom her room was furnished with.]
 28:  259| [45] [There was nothing for her to do afterwards. Just sleep.]
 29:  318| [45] [She changed into her sleepwear and crawled into bed.]
 30:  378| [45] [And soon enough, it came time for lights out, and the room went dark.]
 31:  383| [47] [Salyu]
 32:  384| [45] [(... The professor didn't come today either.)]
 33:  389| [45] [The professor had made it a habit to come up with some sort of reason to go see Salyu each day.]
 34:  394| [45] [But these last few days, even that had come to a halt.]
 35:  399| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  400| [45] [(Is she busy seeing other test subjects...?)]
 37:  405| [45] [The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became.]
 38:  410| [45] [She tried to stop thinking, but she still had a hard time going to sleep.]
 39:  415| [45] [Salyu shut her eyes in the darkness, but--]
 40:  468| [45] [After a short while, the lights suddenly turned on.]
 41:  473| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  476| [45] ["?"]
 43:  481| [45] [She almost feared that morning had come before she had fallen asleep.]
 44:  516| [45] [But as soon as that thought crossed Salyu's mind, the professor rushed into the room.]
 45:  527| [47] [Miyoko]
 46:  530| [45] ["Yui, are you awake!?"]
 47:  535| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  538| [45] ["Professor?"]
 49:  543| [45] [The professor rarely visited at this hour.]
 50:  554| [45] [Confused, Salyu got up from the bed.]
 51:  559| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  562| [45] ["I'm awake. What is it?"]
 53:  570| [47] [Miyoko]
 54:  573| [45] ["Yui, what if I told you I could get you out of here?"]
 55:  578| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  581| [45] ["--Huh?"]
 57:  586| [45] [Salyu gasped at the professor's words.]
 58:  591| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  594| [45] ["... What makes you say that all of a sudden?"]
 60:  620| [47] [Miyoko]
 61:  623| [45] ["I finally gained permission. Let's come to a decision now before the top brass changes their mind."]
 62:  628| [47] [Salyu]
 63:  631| [45] ["... Lies! There's no way that's possible!"]
 64:  636| [45] [Salyu was shaken up by those unexpected words.]
 65:  641| [45] [But the professor spoke clearly.]
 66:  667| [47] [Miyoko]
 67:  670| [45] ["You're right. The upper brass naturally didn't approve of you leaving LABO."]
 68:  675| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  678| [45] ["Understandable. If I spoke of LABO's internal state, it could jeopardize the facility's administration."]
 70:  704| [47] [Miyoko]
 71:  707| [45] ["So that's why I came up with one condition--"]
 72:  715| [47] [Miyoko]
 73:  718| [45] ["'We will fabricate Yui's memory and erase all her memories relating to the true state of LABO.'"]
 74:  744| [47] [Miyoko]
 75:  747| [45] ["In exchange, you will be set free... That was the definite promise we agreed on."]
 76:  752| [47] [Salyu]
 77:  755| [45] ["!"]
 78:  760| [45] [Salyu was surprised for a second-- but when she thought about it, her continued existence in LABO had long since lost its meaning.]
 79:  765| [45] [After losing her role as a test subject, Salyu had apparently already been treated as "discarded".]
 80:  770| [45] [And as long as she had lost her memories of the facility, then even LABO would benefit from getting her out of there.]
 81:  832| [47] [Miyoko]
 82:  835| [45] ["... Yui, answer me honestly."]
 83:  843| [47] [Miyoko]
 84:  846| [45] ["Do you want to leave here and be free?"]
 85:  851| [47] [Salyu]
 86:  852| [45] ["--..."]
 87:  857| [45] [--Salyu did not understand why she answered the way she did at the time.]
 88:  862| [45] [Before this moment, not once had she ever held that hope, and yet--]
 89:  867| [47] [Salyu]
 90:  870| [45] ["... I do."]
 91:  875| [45] [Salyu declared with distinct clarity.]
 92:  880| [45] [That was the first decision she had ever made for herself in her 13 years of life.%NShe chose her own future.]
 93:  912| [47] [Miyoko]
 94:  915| [45] ["Well said, Yui..."]
 95:  923| [47] [Miyoko]
 96:  926| [45] ["I'll grant you freedom, as well as a new role."]
 97: 1013| [45] [--The professor took Salyu by the hand and out of the room.]
 98: 1039| [47] [Miyoko]
 99: 1042| [45] ["Another test subject will be performing the memory manipulation."]
100: 1047| [47] [Salyu]
101: 1050| [45] ["Another test subject...? Subject Y-II?"]
102: 1055| [45] [The professor nodded.]
103: 1060| [45] [Salyu hadn't seen Subject Y-II's face, but she had heard of her designation.]
104: 1065| [45] [There was a Communicator called Subject Y-II in the room next to Salyu's.]
105: 1070| [45] [The professor took Salyu to that room-- and opened the door.]
106: 1217| [45] [Behind the door was a sweet-looking girl.]
107: 1225| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1228| [45] ["Nice to meet you, Yui."]
109: 1233| [47] [Salyu]
110: 1236| [45] ["You're..."]
111: 1262| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 1265| [45] ["I'm Yuuri. Yuuri Kotono."]
113: 1315| [47] [Miyoko]
114: 1318| [45] ["She's the Communicator who will be performing the memory manipulation."]
115: 1344| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 1347| [45] ["It's a pity that we'll have to say goodbye as soon as we're done, and you'll forget your memory of me..."]
117: 1373| [47] [Yuuri]
118: 1376| [45] ["But I won't forget you."]
119: 1381| [47] [Salyu]
120: 1384| [45] ["... I'm sorry."]
121: 1389| [45] [Salyu frantically tried to decipher Yuuri's feelings as she gave that answer.]
122: 1394| [45] [Salyu would be set free; Yuuri would stay confined. That was unfair.]
123: 1399| [45] [So Salyu thought that Yuuri might be sad, but--]
124: 1425| [47] [Yuuri]
125: 1428| [45] ["No need to apologize, okay? I'm really happy."]
126: 1454| [47] [Yuuri]
127: 1457| [45] ["Because I can set you free with my power."]
128: 1462| [45] [Why was she happy? Was she lying or telling the truth? Salyu had no idea.]
129: 1467| [45] [But from the bottom of her heart, Salyu wished for those words to be true.]
130: 1472| [45] [Soon, the professor took medicine out of her pocket.]
131: 1498| [47] [Miyoko]
132: 1501| [45] ["... Yui, take this medicine."]
133: 1506| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1509| [45] ["What's this?"]
135: 1517| [47] [Miyoko]
136: 1520| [45] ["It's a powerful sleep medication LABO often uses. Take this and everything will be over while you're asleep."]
137: 1546| [47] [Miyoko]
138: 1549| [45] ["Once you wake up, you'll be living in the outside world as my distant relative."]
139: 1557| [47] [Miyoko]
140: 1560| [45] ["A legal identity has been prepared for you under the name of Louise Yui Sannomiya, a half-Japanese, half-French girl."]
141: 1565| [47] [Salyu]
142: 1568| [45] ["Sannomiya...?"]
143: 1595| [47] [Miyoko]
144: 1598| [45] ["Sannomiya is my maiden name. Louise-- is a name that means 'renowned warrior'."]
145: 1603| [47] [Salyu]
146: 1606| [45] ["Hmm... Not bad."]
147: 1611| [45] [The professor handed Salyu the medicine.]
148: 1616| [45] [After a moment's hesitation, Salyu swallowed it.]
149: 1626| [45] [It didn't take long before her head began to go hazy.]
150: 1652| [47] [Yuuri]
151: 1655| [45] ["Yui, lie down on my bed."]
152: 1660| [47] [Salyu]
153: 1663| [45] ["O... okay."]
154: 1731| [45] [Salyu plopped onto the bed as told.]
155: 1736| [45] [She heard the professor and Yuuri speaking.]
156: 1741| [47] [Miyoko]
157: 1744| [45] ["Thirteen years of memory is no trifling matter, I understand..."]
158: 1749| [47] [Yuuri]
159: 1752| [45] ["I'll try."]
160: 1757| [45] [That voice faded into the distance.]
161: 1762| [45] [Salyu strained her eyes in an attempt to see Yuuri's face clearly one last time, but--]
162: 1767| [45] [--her eyelids shut against her will.]
163: 1804| [45] [As her sight and hearing sank into the darkness, Salyu felt like she heard the professor's voice.]
164: 1809| [47] [Miyoko]
165: 1812| [45] ["Good night, Yui."]
166: 1817| [47] [Miyoko]
167: 1820| [45] ["Your real life begins tomorrow..."]
168: 1825| [45] [Salyu smiled faintly at those words--]
169: 1830| [45] [--and then she fell into a deep sleep.]
