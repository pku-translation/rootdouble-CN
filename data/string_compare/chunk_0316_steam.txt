  0:   57| [45] [The day of reckoning had finally arrived.]
  1:  109| [45] [September 16, 5:30 AM--]
  2:  114| [45] [Once Ukita confirmed that the hallway he was observing was unpopulated, he sprang into action.]
  3:  199| [45] [He opened the door to find that the security guards on standby--]
  4:  204| [47] [Security Guard 1]
  5:  207| [45] ["Zzz, zzz, zzz, zzz..."]
  6:  212| [47] [Security Guard 2]
  7:  215| [45] ["Kahshhhhhh, kahshhhhhhh..."]
  8:  220| [45] [--were all out cold in a deep sleep.]
  9:  225| [45] [This had all been due to the powerful sleeping agent Ukita had mixed into their coffee half an hour ago.]
 10:  230| [47] [Ukita]
 11:  231| [45] [(Looks like losing all those games of chess was worth it after all...)]
 12:  236| [45] [Ukita allowed himself a small chuckle at that, then went to the engine room to bring the sprinkler system offline.]
 13:  286| [45] [Then at 6:19 AM--]
 14:  340| [45] [Ukita returned to the surveillance room, then immediately checked the monitors to confirm no one was in Area 1's inner ring.]
 15:  348| [47] [Ukita]
 16:  351| [45] ["... Okay then, let's begin."]
 17:  362| [45] [He muttered that to persuade himself, then turned on the PA to Area 1's inner ring.]
 18:  367| [45] [Next, he took out his PDA and played the immediate detonation sound file.]
 19:  372| [45] [The ultrasonic waves then played over the PA--]
 20:  398| [45] [The explosions and shockwaves from Area 1's inner ring faintly reached the surveillance room.]
 21:  403| [47] [Ukita]
 22:  404| [45] [(Next order of business is Areas 2 and 3...)]
 23:  409| [47] [Ukita]
 24:  410| [45] [(Okay, no one's around the bombs-- now!)]
 25:  451| [45] [He then detonated the bombs one after another, causing LABO's automatic PA to start broadcasting.]
 26:  462| [47] [Automatic PA]
 27:  465| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 2."]
 28:  491| [47] [Automatic PA]
 29:  494| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B2 Area 3."]
 30:  520| [47] [Automatic PA]
 31:  523| [45] ["--A fire has broken out in B1 Area 5."]
 32:  549| [47] [Automatic PA]
 33:  552| [45] ["Security has shifted to 'Evacuation Mode'. All gates, barring those leading to Area N, have been opened."]
 34:  578| [47] [Automatic PA]
 35:  581| [45] ["All personnel, please calmly evacuate to the surface levels."]
 36:  607| [47] [Ukita]
 37:  608| [45] [(Perfect! The warning system is active! It should be sending a dispatch request to Sirius right about now!)]
 38:  613| [47] [Ukita]
 39:  614| [45] [(--I have to evacuate the rest of the staff while they're on their way here!)]
 40:  619| [45] [Ukita adopted a tone of desperation as he spoke into the facility's PA.]
 41:  627| [47] [Ukita]
 42:  630| [45] ["Th-this is an emergency broadcast!"]
 43:  638| [47] [Ukita]
 44:  641| [45] ["Explosions of unknown origin have just occurred within the facility!"]
 45:  649| [47] [Ukita]
 46:  652| [45] ["From our current understanding of the situation, explosions occurred simultaneously in ten different locations inside the facility. Fires have broken out as a result!"]
 47:  660| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  663| [45] ["Researchers Eriguchi and Kashiwagi! Please come to Area 2 posthaste!"]
 49:  671| [47] [Ukita]
 50:  674| [45] ["I wish to consult the two of you about taking out top secret data!"]
 51:  679| [45] [--With the pieces for the plan now all in place, he stopped broadcasting for the time being.]
 52:  684| [45] [By then, a great clamor of people desperately running for their lives had already begun, even right outside the surveillance room.]
 53:  742| [45] [Ukita opened the door and looked outside, then called to some nearby staffers.]
 54:  750| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  753| [45] ["Please help! The security guards in here are unconscious! Take them outside!"]
 56:  758| [47] [Staff Member 1]
 57:  761| [45] ["O-okay. But what about you?"]
 58:  769| [47] [Ukita]
 59:  772| [45] ["I'll stay here and lead the evacuation! Don't worry about me and just get out of here!"]
 60:  777| [45] [Ukita then ran on over to the control room.]
 61:  834| [45] [There were still many researchers in there.]
 62:  839| [45] [Ukita had learned a while back that they were using the WX particle amplifier this morning to conduct some sort of experiment.]
 63:  844| [45] [He shouted at the group of people there still manning their posts.]
 64:  852| [47] [Ukita]
 65:  855| [45] ["What are you people doing!? Hurry up and get out of here!"]
 66:  860| [47] [Researcher 1]
 67:  863| [45] ["But the amplifier is still online--"]
 68:  871| [47] [Ukita]
 69:  874| [45] ["Brain Cell will automatically take care of shutting it off if you leave it alone, right!?"]
 70:  882| [47] [Ukita]
 71:  885| [45] ["And even in the event that fails, you can still turn it off from the remote control room on the surface level!"]
 72:  893| [47] [Ukita]
 73:  896| [45] ["Just hurry up and get out of here! If you die, it'll all be for nothing!"]
 74:  901| [47] [Researcher 2]
 75:  904| [45] ["--R-right!"]
 76:  910| [45] [And with that shout, the researchers all scrambled out of the room.]
 77:  915| [47] [Ukita]
 78:  916| [45] [(Good, now's my chance--!)]
 79:  922| [45] [Now that he had cleared the room of people, Ukita walked up to Brain Cell's control panel.]
 80:  927| [45] [He checked the monitor to find that the WX particle amplifier was apparently maintaining a steady output of "500 mSv".]
 81:  932| [45] [If left on its own, those levels would automatically decrease.]
 82:  943| [45] [But Ukita swiftly operated the control panel and rose its output to maximum.]
 83:  949| [45] [--The particle readings then gradually began to rise.]
 84:  954| [45] ["501 mSv", "502 mSv", "504 mSv"...!]
 85:  959| [47] [Ukita]
 86:  960| [45] [(... Good, this should soon render the amplifier out of control!)]
 87:  965| [45] [It truly was a device that required the utmost attention to operate. It easily went haywire when the output was intentionally set to maximum.]
 88:  970| [47] [Ukita]
 89:  971| [45] [(It's do or die from here on out!)]
 90:  976| [45] [Ukita ran out of the control room.]
 91: 1029| [45] [He then returned to the surveillance room to find that the security guards were gone.]
 92: 1034| [45] [All that remained was a security card someone had dropped.]
 93: 1039| [45] [Ukita picked it up and continued his acts of destruction as he made further broadcasts.]
 94: 1091| [45] [The clamor soon grew faint, and eventually, he could no longer spot anyone on the monitors.]
 95: 1102| [45] [Ukita quickly picked up the receiver of the ringing extension phone.]
 96: 1116| [47] [Ukita]
 97: 1119| [45] ["Hello, this is the surveillance room."]
 98: 1124| [47] [Security Guard]
 99: 1127| [45] ["Oh... so someone's still there!?"]
100: 1132| [47] [Security Guard]
101: 1135| [45] ["This is the surface floor surveillance room. I hate to cut to the chase, but who are you?"]
102: 1140| [47] [Security Guard]
103: 1143| [45] ["According to the roll call, three staff members are still in the basement: Eriguchi, Kashiwagi, and Ukita--"]
104: 1151| [47] [Ukita]
105: 1154| [45] ["Understood! I will find those two posthaste and have them evacuate!"]
106: 1159| [45] [Ukita shouted that, then hung up the phone.]
107: 1170| [45] ["Eriguchi" and "Kashiwagi" were the two researchers Ukita had summoned over the PA earlier.]
108: 1175| [45] [According to the listing he checked beforehand, both of them had the authority to enter Area Zero.]
109: 1180| [45] [It was likely that Watase and his coworkers had already arrived and caught them at this point.]
110: 1185| [45] [Once Ukita had determined that, he turned back to the PA's mic and spoke.]
111: 1193| [47] [Ukita]
112: 1196| [45] ["According to the roll-call on the ground floor, evacuation of all staff members has been confirmed!"]
113: 1204| [47] [Ukita]
114: 1207| [45] ["In the unlikely event that anyone besides staff members has been left behind, please escape through Areas 5 and 6 immediately!"]
115: 1212| [45] [He made that broadcast as a sign for Watase and his coworkers just to be safe.]
116: 1260| [45] [But he wouldn't waste time waiting for them to arrive.]
117: 1317| [45] [He went on over to the control room and checked on the current status of the amplifier.]
118: 1322| [45] [The levels in Area N were at "2315 mSv". The value was rising at a good pace.]
119: 1327| [45] [Brain Cell had begun efforts to perform an emergency shutdown on the amplifier, but it was too late.]
120: 1332| [45] [The monitor showed that the shutdown and the dampening of the particles were scheduled to finish at "18:16".]
121: 1337| [47] [Ukita]
122: 1338| [45] [(About 11 hours left to go! Good, everything's gone perfectly up to this point!)]
123: 1343| [45] [And when he went back to the surveillance room--]
124: 1403| [45] [Watase and his coworkers quickly showed up, carrying the unconscious high ranked researchers with them.]
125: 1436| [47] [Watase]
126: 1439| [45] ["We'll head on down to Area Zero and rescue the test subjects."]
127: 1447| [47] [Ukita]
128: 1450| [45] ["I'll stay here and keep an eye out to make sure nothing unexpected happens."]
129: 1455| [45] [Watase nodded, then proceeded to run out of the room with Dojima and Hiyama.]
130: 1529| [45] [But then they didn't come back when expected.]
131: 1534| [45] [A Case N hadn't been declared yet, either.]
132: 1539| [47] [Ukita]
133: 1540| [45] [(They're taking too long...! What's keeping them!?)]
134: 1545| [47] [Ukita]
135: 1546| [45] [(I thought I made it clear to them they'd be in real danger once the particle levels exceeded 4000 mSv!)]
136: 1551| [45] [But his thoughts were immediately interrupted by the sudden nigh-deafening ringing of a siren.]
137: 1573| [47] [Automatic PA]
138: 1576| [45] ["--A 'Case N' has just been detected."]
139: 1581| [47] [Automatic PA]
140: 1584| [45] ["In accordance with this emergency, security has shifted to Blockade Mode."]
141: 1589| [47] [Automatic PA]
142: 1592| [45] ["Locking down all gates and bulkheads."]
143: 1597| [45] [Ukita checked the time in surprise to find that Watase and his coworkers were 20 minutes behind schedule.]
144: 1602| [47] [Ukita]
145: 1603| [45] [(Did... did they make it in time?)]
146: 1608| [45] [Ukita detonated the rest of the bombs while thinking that he'd check Watase and his coworkers afterwards to see if they were okay.]
147: 1675| [45] [Some of the bombs failed to detonate, but he had expected a few duds.]
148: 1680| [45] [And right as Ukita administered the AD he had prepared beforehand, Watase and his coworkers returned.]
149: 1719| [47] [Ukita]
150: 1722| [45] ["You're late! Did something happen to you three!?"]
151: 1730| [47] [Watase]
152: 1733| [45] ["N-no... we're okay for now, but..."]
153: 1741| [47] [Ukita]
154: 1744| [45] ["Really...?"]
155: 1749| [45] [Watase replied to Ukita's concerned question with distaste.]
156: 1777| [47] [Watase]
157: 1780| [45] ["I said we're okay, didn't I? More importantly--"]
158: 1806| [47] [Watase]
159: 1809| [45] ["We're in big trouble! There was only one test subject in Area Zero!"]
160: 1817| [47] [Ukita]
161: 1820| [45] ["What!?"]
162: 1831| [45] [Watase then proceeded to explain the situation.]
163: 1836| [45] [Subject Y-II was nowhere to be found.]
164: 1841| [45] [Ukita then realized the two high-ranked researchers were missing. He asked about their fates-- and was met with an unbelievable answer.]
165: 1846| [47] [Ukita]
166: 1847| [45] [(The rescue workers killed them in Area Zero!?)]
167: 1854| [45] [Ukita started flaring up at Watase before he even knew what he was doing.]
168: 1914| [47] [Ukita]
169: 1917| [45] ["Captain Kasasagi, this isn't what you promised!"]
170: 1925| [47] [Ukita]
171: 1928| [45] ["You told me there'd be no casualties, remember!?"]
172: 1954| [47] [Watase]
173: 1957| [45] ["H-hold on! Calm down, Mr. Ukita!"]
174: 1965| [47] [Ukita]
175: 1968| [45] ["You said you wouldn't hurt anyone, right!? Was that a lie!?"]
176: 1976| [47] [Ukita]
177: 1979| [45] ["If you're saying it was, then the three of you must--"]
178: 2002| [45] [Ukita instinctively tried to grab Watase, but at that moment--]
179: 2060| [47] [Ukita]
180: 2063| [45] ["!"]
181: 2068| [45] [He was struck in the back of the head.]
182: 2083| [47] [Ukita]
183: 2086| [45] ["Wh... y...?"]
184: 2091| [45] [He could still make out Watase's voice as his consciousness faded.]
185: 2160| [47] [Watase]
186: 2163| [45] ["... I'm sorry, Mr. Ukita."]
187: 2171| [47] [Watase]
188: 2174| [45] ["It's too late... for us to turn back."]
189: 2179| [45] [Watase had said "us".]
190: 2186| [45] [But it didn't seem like he was including Ukita when he said that.]
191: 2191| [47] [Ukita]
192: 2192| [45] [(Have I... been betrayed...?)]
193: 2197| [45] [Ukita lost consciousness as if he were drowning in a sea of his own dismay.]
194: 2212| [45] [------]
195: 2217| [45] [...]
196: 2222| [45] [... He had no idea how long he'd been out for.]
197: 2230| [47] [Ukita]
198: 2233| [45] ["U... ugh..."]
199: 2259| [47] [Ukita]
200: 2262| [45] ["What happened to me...?"]
201: 2270| [47] [Ukita]
202: 2273| [45] ["Th-that's right... Captain Kasasagi knocked me out..."]
203: 2327| [45] [When he came to his senses, he realized that the security card around his neck and the one he had in his pocket were both gone.]
204: 2342| [47] [Ukita]
205: 2343| [45] [(Where did they go...!?)]
206: 2349| [45] [Ukita proceeded to check the surveillance monitors to get a grasp of the current situation.]
207: 2354| [45] [But most of the cameras had been damaged as a result of the explosions, so they weren't very helpful.]
208: 2359| [47] [Ukita]
209: 2360| [45] [(Dammit, where the hell did they all go!? Did they leave me behind!?)]
210: 2365| [47] [Ukita]
211: 2366| [45] [(It can't be... Were they planning on making me their scapegoat from the very start!?)]
212: 2371| [45] [Ukita's heart still harbored the desire to trust in Watase.]
213: 2376| [45] [But the fact that Watase's team had killed two men and knocked him unconscious created a powerful sense of ambivalence in him.]
214: 2384| [47] [Ukita]
215: 2387| [45] ["... F-forget that... First I just need to do whatever I can for now...!"]
216: 2392| [45] [He had to erase all evidence that he had participated in this attack in the chance he was caught.]
217: 2403| [45] [It was with that thought that he began deleting the security footage--]
218: 2453| [45] [--But a short while later, he discovered some most stunning footage.]
219: 2515| [47] [Ukita]
220: 2518| [45] ["Th-this is...!"]
221: 2523| [45] [Ukita frantically paused the video.]
222: 2541| [47] [Ukita]
223: 2544| [45] ["This is... impossible...! Why were they...?"]
224: 2549| [45] [Natsuhiko and his friends were right there in the security footage!]
225: 2554| [45] [The image was a bit fuzzy as a result of the explosions, but there was no doubt as to who those three were.]
226: 2559| [45] [Ukita felt his pulse skyrocket in shock.]
227: 2564| [47] [Ukita]
228: 2565| [45] [(I-it can't be... Did they go directly to LABO after last night!?)]
229: 2570| [47] [Ukita]
230: 2571| [45] [(Meaning they got caught up in our terrorist attack--!)]
231: 2578| [45] [Ukita had set off the bombs a few hours ago in places where people weren't around.]
232: 2583| [45] [But he'd been so busy that he hadn't even checked the monitors thoroughly enough to see who was on them.]
233: 2588| [45] [It was for that reason he hadn't noticed Natsuhiko and his friends.]
234: 2593| [47] [Ukita]
235: 2594| [45] [(This is bad... this is bad, this is bad!)]
236: 2599| [47] [Ukita]
237: 2600| [45] [(If they weren't able to get out of here, then it's all my fault! No question about it!)]
238: 2605| [45] [--But just as Ukita thought that...]
239: 2610| [45] [He heard voices from outside.]
240: 2665| [47] [???]
241: 2668| [45] ["Heeey! Is someone in there!?"]
242: 2678| [47] [Ukita]
243: 2681| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
244: 2689| [47] [Ukita]
245: 2692| [45] ["That voice-- is that you, Captain Kasasagi!?"]
246: 2700| [47] [Watase]
247: 2703| [45] ["What!? Y-you know who I am!?"]
248: 2711| [47] [Ukita]
249: 2714| [45] ["H-how could I -not- know you..."]
250: 2752| [45] [He opened the door to find none other than Watase standing there.]
251: 2757| [45] [But it wasn't just him-- accompanying him were two rescue workers and two other women Ukita had never seen before.]
252: 2783| [47] [Ena]
253: 2786| [45] ["I'm Ena Tsubakiyama. I'm a high school teacher who was called to this facility."]
254: 2812| [47] [Yuuri]
255: 2815| [45] ["I'm Yuuri... I'm family to one of LABO's researchers."]
256: 2820| [45] [Ukita looked at their presence with suspicious eyes.]
257: 2825| [47] [Ukita]
258: 2826| [45] [(... Something is not right here. No matter the circumstances, only staff members are supposed to be allowed in LABO. Everyone else is forbidden.)]
259: 2831| [47] [Ukita]
260: 2832| [45] [(No, but more importantly, that "Yuuri" girl... Could she be Subject Y-II!?)]
261: 2931| [45] [But the one Ukita was most confused about was Watase.]
262: 2936| [45] [He had apparently gotten some form of memory impairment and couldn't even remember Ukita.]
263: 2941| [47] [Ukita]
264: 2942| [45] [(What in the world is going on!? Is it a lie he cooked up on the spot when he came across his other subordinates that weren't supposed to be down here!?)]
265: 2947| [47] [Ukita]
266: 2948| [45] [(But even if that is the case, then what happened to Dojima and Hiyama!? What about Subject N!? Where did they all go!?)]
267: 2953| [45] [Ukita was confused by the series of unexpected events--]
268: 3007| [45] [But when he saw Subject Y-II in front of him...]
269: 3057| [45] [... and remembered that Natsuhiko and his friends could still be trapped down in the basement--]
270: 3096| [45] [--Ukita regained his composure.]
271: 3101| [47] [Ukita]
272: 3102| [45] [(That's right, I must calm down and remember why everything I did today was necessary.)]
273: 3107| [45] [He didn't know what was going on. Perhaps Watase and his coworkers had betrayed him.]
274: 3112| [45] [But all of Ukita's actions on that day were for the sake of saving the test subjects and Natsuhiko.]
275: 3117| [47] [Ukita]
276: 3118| [45] [(So as long as I don't allow my conviction to be shaken-- I should be able to get them out of LABO.)]
277: 3123| [45] [A fire began blazing in Ukita's heart, much like the one from that rainy day so long ago.]
278: 3177| [45] [And with that, Ukita and the others began to move.]
279: 3228| [45] [Their goal was to find the survivors, AD, and an escape route...]
280: 3260| [45] [--Just then, a floral scent drifted in from somewhere.]
281: 3280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
282: 3281| [45] [(! This scent...!)]
283: 3286| [47] [Natsuhiko]
284: 3287| [45] [(This is it! Mr. Ukita's memories were distorted after this point!)]
285: 3292| [45] [Natsuhiko's consciousness tensed up at that moment.]
286: 3297| [45] [Yuuri's voice echoed in his head.]
287: 3365| [47] [Yuuri]
288: 3368| [45] [{Hikorin! Look for that floral scent in the memories past this part!}]
289: 3373| [47] [Natsuhiko]
290: 3374| [45] [(Yeah!)]
291: 3379| [47] [Yuuri]
292: 3382| [45] [{Then try to remember what happened after this point.}]
293: 3406| [47] [Yuuri]
294: 3409| [45] [{Remember how Mr. Ukita felt...}]
295: 3433| [47] [Yuuri]
296: 3436| [45] [{His memories should be repaired to their proper form depending on your feelings.}]
297: 3441| [47] [Yuuri]
298: 3444| [45] [{Once you've done that, you can return him back to normal.}]
299: 3507| [45] [Natsuhiko fortified his determination and began memory access once again.]
300: 3561| [45] [His search criterion--]
301: 3566| [45] ["Floral-scented memories"]
