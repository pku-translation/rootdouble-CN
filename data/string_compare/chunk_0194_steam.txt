  1:  105| [47] [Mashiro]
  2:  108| [45] ["For now, let's go to my house! We need to secure a hiding place!"]
  3:  218| [45] [In accordance with that suggestion, the three of them headed to Mashiro's house.]
  4:  223| [45] [The Toba residence was quite nearby. No more than three minutes if you ran.]
  5:  228| [45] [But once they got close--]
  6:  254| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  257| [45] ["... Huh? Hold on, guys!"]
  8:  262| [45] [Natsuhiko and Salyu stopped at Mashiro's command.]
  9:  270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 10:  273| [45] ["What's wrong, Mashiro?"]
 11:  299| [47] [Mashiro]
 12:  302| [45] ["There's somebody by the entranceway..."]
 13:  307| [45] [And true enough, they looked to see silhouettes standing in front of the Toba residence.]
 14:  312| [45] [Mashiro's mother was talking to two men.]
 15:  320| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 16:  323| [45] ["Who's she talking to...?"]
 17:  381| [45] [They hid themselves and strained their ears on the conversation between Mashiro's mother and the two men.]
 18:  386| [47] [Security Dept. 1]
 19:  389| [45] ["... Your daughter snuck into the Parapsychology Research Center and injured a security guard."]
 20:  394| [45] [The three kids gasped at the conversation.]
 21:  399| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  400| [45] [(The security department...!)]
 23:  405| [45] [The security department had apparently already gotten here.]
 24:  410| [45] [Mashiro's mother spoke in surprise.]
 25:  415| [47] [Mrs. Toba]
 26:  418| [45] ["No, not my daughter!? There has to be some sort of mistake!"]
 27:  423| [47] [Security Dept. 1]
 28:  426| [45] ["I'm sorry ma'am, but she was caught by a surveillance camera. There's no doubt about it."]
 29:  431| [47] [Security Dept. 1]
 30:  434| [45] ["Is it all right if we wait here for your daughter to return?"]
 31:  439| [47] [Mrs. Toba]
 32:  442| [45] ["Not at all! Besides, look at the time... I must ask you two to please leave!"]
 33:  450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  453| [45] ["This is bad... they're pressing her."]
 35:  494| [47] [Salyu]
 36:  497| [45] ["It's partly true, so it's in some ways unavoidable... I'm sorry Mashiro. It's my fault."]
 37:  523| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  526| [45] ["It's okay, Salyu. I'll explain the situation to Mom with telepathy."]
 39:  549| [45] [And with that, Mashiro placed a finger to her temple.]
 40:  654| [45] [Using telepathy on a blood relative was probably easy enough for her.]
 41:  659| [45] [And she was probably successful in contacting her, but--]
 42:  718| [45] [Right after that, Mashiro's mother shouted.]
 43:  723| [47] [Mrs. Toba]
 44:  726| [45] ["Mashiro!? Is that you, Mashiro!?"]
 45:  731| [47] [Security Dept. 1]
 46:  734| [45] ["!?"]
 47:  739| [45] [The security department members snapped back and looked around.]
 48:  744| [47] [Security Dept. 1]
 49:  747| [45] ["Where is she!?"]
 50:  752| [45] [The security department members' voices echoed. There was no time to hesitate.]
 51:  793| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  796| [45] ["Let's get out of here. Things are gonna get problematic."]
 53:  804| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 54:  807| [45] ["Right!"]
 55:  812| [45] [Mashiro nodded and dashed off.]
 56:  876| [45] [But as she ran, she yelled.]
 57:  884| [47] [Mashiro]
 58:  887| [45] ["Mom, believe in me! I did nothing wrong!"]
 59:  892| [45] [Mashiro's voice resounded in the dark residential area.]
 60:  998| [45] [--The kids avoided the security department and ran with reckless abandon.]
 61: 1003| [45] [But no matter where they ran, the shadows of people who seemed like security department members appeared.]
 62: 1008| [47] [Security Dept. 2]
 63: 1011| [45] ["There they are! After them!"]
 64: 1016| [45] [Each time they heard that, they turned back and rushed through a back street.]
 65: 1024| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 66: 1027| [45] ["Dammit. How can they manage to find us no matter where we go!?"]
 67: 1053| [47] [Mashiro]
 68: 1056| [45] ["Natsuhiko, it's those things!"]
 69: 1064| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 70: 1067| [45] ["Huh!?"]
 71: 1072| [45] [Natsuhiko snapped toward where she was pointing to find a security camera.]
 72: 1126| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 73: 1127| [45] [(Dammit...!)]
 74: 1132| [45] [The security department had the authority to use the security cameras.]
 75: 1137| [45] [The camera footage was likely being sent to the municipal office server where they could inspect it in realtime.]
 76: 1142| [45] [They could check it on PDAs or something to follow the kids' tracks.]
 77: 1228| [47] [Mashiro]
 78: 1231| [45] ["What do we do? They're going to catch us!"]
 79: 1239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1242| [45] ["Calm down. Let's escape to a place without any cameras!"]
 81: 1333| [45] [The kids ran desperately, avoiding human presence, avoiding cameras.]
 82: 1457| [45] [And in all the confusion, they ended up in Rokumei Park.]
 83: 1465| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1468| [45] ["Haah, haah..."]
 85: 1509| [47] [Mashiro]
 86: 1512| [45] ["Th-think we'll be safe here...?"]
 87: 1538| [47] [Salyu]
 88: 1541| [45] ["No."]
 89: 1546| [45] [Salyu pointed to the woods as she said that.]
 90: 1656| [45] [And hidden in the grove of trees was indeed another security camera.]
 91: 1742| [47] [Mashiro]
 92: 1745| [45] ["Not here too...!"]
 93: 1753| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 94: 1756| [45] ["Dammit, is there no escape!?"]
 95: 1761| [45] [The devices ordinarily used to maintain public order were now being used to track the kids down.]
 96: 1766| [47] [Alice]
 97: 1769| [45] ["Kyuu, kyuu... kyuu, kyuu...!"]
 98: 1774| [45] [Alice squeaked as if to speak for their anxiety.]
 99: 1782| [47] [Natsuhiko]
100: 1785| [45] ["... The security department's sure to show up here too. Let's run."]
101: 1811| [47] [Mashiro]
102: 1814| [45] ["R-right!"]
103: 1819| [45] [Right as they were about to run-- Salyu took control of the situation.]
104: 1845| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1848| [45] ["Wait, you two."]
106: 1856| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1859| [45] ["Huh?"]
108: 1885| [47] [Salyu]
109: 1888| [45] ["The security department's going to look at that camera's footage and chase after us, right?"]
110: 1914| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1917| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
112: 1943| [47] [Salyu]
113: 1946| [45] ["Then let's think about it the other way around: they won't search places where the cameras don't see us."]
114: 1954| [47] [Natsuhiko]
115: 1957| [45] ["Yeah, and...?"]
116: 1983| [47] [Salyu]
117: 1986| [45] ["I'll manipulate the camera. Come with me, you two."]
118: 1991| [45] [And with that, Salyu entered the security camera's blind spot and rushed over to it.]
119: 1996| [45] [And then she poked Alice around her neck.]
120: 2001| [45] [Which caused some sort of cable to wind out of her.]
121: 2009| [47] [Natsuhiko]
122: 2012| [45] ["Wah! Wh-what's that!?"]
123: 2038| [47] [Salyu]
124: 2041| [45] ["Alice isn't just a facial expression recognition device. She's also a multifunction mobile PC."]
125: 2046| [45] [Salyu opened a panel on Alice's back, revealing an LCD display.]
126: 2072| [47] [Mashiro]
127: 2075| [45] ["She's a computer?"]
128: 2083| [47] [Salyu]
129: 2086| [45] ["Yes. And this screen is a touch panel."]
130: 2094| [47] [Salyu]
131: 2097| [45] ["She possesses all essential functions including communication, audiovisual recording, and data I/O. She also accepts voice commands."]
132: 2105| [47] [Salyu]
133: 2108| [45] ["Furthermore, Dr. Tenkawa preinstalled various sorts of software, so--"]
134: 2116| [47] [Salyu]
135: 2119| [45] ["It should be no trouble at all to manipulate the camera footage using some of that software."]
136: 2124| [45] [And with that, Salyu began to tamper with the security camera.]
137: 2129| [45] [She skillfully removed the cover on the security camera, took out the terminal port and connected it to Alice's cable.]
138: 2137| [47] [Salyu]
139: 2140| [45] ["Alice, start command."]
140: 2148| [47] [Salyu]
141: 2151| [45] ["'Capture 10 seconds of footage from the input pin and loop it into the output pin.' End command."]
142: 2156| [47] [Alice]
143: 2159| [45] ["Kyuu!"]
144: 2164| [45] [Natsuhiko and Mashiro looked blankly as Alice answered reliably.]
145: 2190| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 2193| [45] ["Uh, umm...? Ms. Salyu, what might you be doing?"]
147: 2219| [47] [Salyu]
148: 2222| [45] ["I connected the security camera's output terminal to Alice and captured footage from the camera."]
149: 2230| [47] [Salyu]
150: 2233| [45] ["So now Alice has stored security footage that we don't show up in."]
151: 2259| [47] [Salyu]
152: 2262| [45] ["So now by connecting Alice to the input terminal and looping the footage..."]
153: 2270| [47] [Natsuhiko]
154: 2273| [45] ["I see! So basically we won't show up on this camera anymore, huh!"]
155: 2278| [45] [Salyu nodded at Natsuhiko's words.]
156: 2304| [47] [Salyu]
157: 2307| [45] ["Yes. So now even if the security department checks the camera feed, they shouldn't expect anyone to be in the park."]
158: 2333| [47] [Salyu]
159: 2336| [45] ["Though we were caught on camera here once, so it's not a foolproof plan..."]
160: 2362| [47] [Mashiro]
161: 2365| [45] ["Still, it's quite safer than any other place!"]
162: 2373| [47] [Natsuhiko]
163: 2376| [45] ["That's amazing, Salyu! I didn't even know you could do something like that!"]
164: 2402| [47] [Salyu]
165: 2405| [45] ["It's not anything that praiseworthy."]
166: 2431| [47] [Salyu]
167: 2434| [45] ["So let's stand by in this park until some of the heat dies down."]
168: 2442| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2445| [45] ["Yeah, I mean, I am a little tired..."]
170: 2471| [47] [Mashiro]
171: 2474| [45] ["Let's take a short break then, I guess."]
172: 2479| [45] [And with that, the kids sat down in the grass.]
