  0:   69| [45] [--After they reunited with Watase in Area 1--]
  1:   74| [45] [Kazami and the others saved "Yuuri", a civilian who got caught up in the accident--]
  2:  119| [45] [But then Watase said something bizarre just afterwards.]
  3:  213| [47] [Watase]
  4:  216| [45] ["You've been calling me 'Captain'... so does that mean I'm the captain of a rescue squad or something?"]
  5:  221| [47] [Kazami]
  6:  224| [45] ["What... do you mean by that?"]
  7:  252| [47] [Watase]
  8:  255| [45] ["Well, the thing is... I don't know anything."]
  9:  263| [47] [Watase]
 10:  266| [45] ["Not who I am, or even where I am..."]
 11:  320| [47] [Kazami]
 12:  323| [45] ["Y-you don't mean..."]
 13:  376| [47] [Jun]
 14:  379| [45] ["You've got amnesia...?"]
 15:  433| [47] [Watase]
 16:  436| [45] ["... Y-yeah... I guess you -would- call this amnesia..."]
 17:  441| [47] [Kazami]
 18:  442| [45] [(That can't be--!)]
 19:  447| [45] [Kazami was doubtful for a second, but--]
 20:  816| [47] [Kazami]
 21:  819| [45] ["Is that true...?"]
 22:  883| [47] [Watase]
 23:  886| [45] ["Yeah... I know because my head's been hurting like hell for a while now."]
 24:  923| [47] [Watase]
 25:  926| [45] ["Maybe I hit it on something."]
 26:  973| [47] [Watase]
 27:  976| [45] ["That's probably why I'm feeling so dazed and having trouble remembering things."]
 28: 1043| [45] [--Natsuhiko repaired that false memory.]
 29: 1203| [45] [First, she asked what was most urgent to confirm.]
 30: 1208| [47] [Kazami]
 31: 1211| [45] ["P-please hold on a moment, Captain! Did you hurt your head by any chance!?"]
 32: 1242| [47] [Watase]
 33: 1245| [45] ["My head...? Now that you mention it, I did have this really bad headache a few minutes ago..."]
 34: 1250| [45] [Fear and relief mixed in Kazami's heart when she heard that.]
 35: 1255| [47] [Kazami]
 36: 1258| [45] ["I knew it...! There's a possibility that you hit your head on something."]
 37: 1263| [47] [Kazami]
 38: 1266| [45] ["That's probably why you're feeling so dazed and having trouble remembering things.%NThen that means your memories should return in time."]
 39: 1292| [47] [Watase]
 40: 1295| [45] ["I-is that how it works?"]
 41: 1300| [47] [Kazami]
 42: 1303| [45] ["Yes. It appears that retrograde amnesia caused by physical trauma goes away fairly quickly on its own without requiring any particular treatment in most cases."]
 43: 1329| [47] [Watase]
 44: 1332| [45] ["... Then you're saying this is only temporary?"]
 45: 1337| [47] [Kazami]
 46: 1340| [45] ["Yes. But if you suffered brain damage by any chance, it's possible that your amnesia could be permanent."]
 47: 1393| [47] [Jun]
 48: 1396| [45] ["What the hell? That's horrible...!"]
 49: 1422| [47] [Jun]
 50: 1425| [45] ["Captain, how bad is your headache? Do you feel like throwing up?"]
 51: 1479| [47] [Watase]
 52: 1482| [45] ["No... my head doesn't hurt at all right now, and my stomach feels fine."]
 53: 1487| [45] [Kazami felt a twinge of relief from those words.]
 54: 1492| [47] [Kazami]
 55: 1493| [45] [(But though it may be temporary, it doesn't change the fact that he's in a bad spot!)]
 56: 1498| [47] [Kazami]
 57: 1499| [45] [(I must give him my support!)]
 58: 1504| [45] [Kazami focused her mind on the new, prevalent issue at hand.]
 59: 1547| [45] [--she decided to ask about it indirectly.]
 60: 1552| [47] [Kazami]
 61: 1555| [45] ["Is that true...?"]
 62: 1608| [47] [Watase]
 63: 1611| [45] ["Yeah... I know because my head's been hurting like hell for a while now."]
 64: 1619| [47] [Watase]
 65: 1622| [45] ["Maybe I hit it on something."]
 66: 1630| [47] [Watase]
 67: 1633| [45] ["That's probably why I'm feeling so dazed and having trouble remembering things."]
 68: 1687| [47] [Jun]
 69: 1690| [45] ["...!?"]
 70: 1695| [45] [For someone who had just lost his memories, that was a rather calm, logical explanation.]
 71: 1700| [47] [Kazami]
 72: 1701| [45] [(That's odd... I mean, it -is- the kind of answer I would expect to hear from him, but that's exactly the problem...)]
 73: 1706| [45] [But Kazami didn't follow up on her doubts.]
 74: 1711| [47] [Kazami]
 75: 1714| [45] ["... Then that means your memories should return with time."]
 76: 1768| [47] [Watase]
 77: 1771| [45] ["I-is that how it works?"]
 78: 1776| [47] [Kazami]
 79: 1779| [45] ["Yes. It appears that retrograde amnesia caused by physical trauma goes away fairly quickly on its own without requiring any particular treatment in most cases."]
 80: 1805| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1808| [45] ["... Then you're saying this is only temporary?"]
 82: 1813| [45] [Watase sounded relieved.]
 83: 1818| [47] [Kazami]
 84: 1819| [45] [(Maybe I should have asked him for more details...?)]
 85: 1824| [47] [Kazami]
 86: 1825| [45] [(Then again, there's a time for everything...)]
 87: 1830| [45] [Kazami ended her train of thought right then and there.]
 88: 1835| [45] [But that decision gave rise to some reservations in her heart.]
 89: 2004| [45] [--At any rate, Kazami decided to put Watase's safety first and told him to wait behind in the makeshift base.]
 90: 2009| [45] [But he refused to accept that proposal.]
 91: 2035| [47] [Watase]
 92: 2038| [45] ["Let me help out with rescuing any other survivors!"]
 93: 2043| [47] [Kazami]
 94: 2046| [45] ["Huh? But--"]
 95: 2072| [47] [Watase]
 96: 2075| [45] ["But that doesn't change that I'm still a rescue worker, right? So I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I just sat on the sidelines while you're all still hard at work."]
 97: 2080| [45] [Hearing that made Kazami a little happy.]
 98: 2085| [45] [For despite his amnesia, Watase still had the heart of a rescue worker.]
 99: 2090| [47] [Kazami]
100: 2093| [45] ["... Sheesh, some things just never change..."]
101: 2098| [45] [--But one could not survive this line of work with passion alone.]
102: 2103| [45] [So Kazami decided to act more strictly than usual to try and protect Watase, Jun, and Yuuri.]
103: 2108| [47] [Kazami]
104: 2111| [45] ["This is no ordinary mission. So if you want to stay with us as a rescue worker, then you must be prepared to accept the responsibilities and duties that come with it."]
105: 2137| [47] [Watase]
106: 2140| [45] ["...!"]
107: 2145| [47] [Kazami]
108: 2148| [45] ["You will be treated as a new recruit until you regain your memory. I ask that you follow my orders just as Moribe does."]
109: 2153| [47] [Kazami]
110: 2156| [45] ["I know this is a severe violation of my station, but trust me when I say your life could be in grave danger if you don't do as I say... Please try to understand."]
111: 2184| [47] [Watase]
112: 2187| [45] ["Y... yeah, roger that!"]
113: 2192| [45] [Kazami silently encouraged Watase when she heard that.]
114: 2197| [47] [Kazami]
115: 2198| [45] [(Please don't push yourself...!)]
116: 2228| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought to himself as he finished viewing that memory.]
117: 2233| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 2234| [45] [(Maybe her positive feelings towards Watase are a bit weak here...?)]
119: 2239| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2240| [45] [(Probably be best if I adjusted that a little bit...)]
