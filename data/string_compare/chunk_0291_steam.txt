  1:   81| [47] [Watase]
  2:   84| [45] ["Wha..."]
  3:   89| [45] [Watase was greatly perturbed by Natsuhiko's declaration.]
  4:   94| [47] [Watase]
  5:   95| [45] [("I can manipulate memories"...?)]
  6:  100| [45] [He would have laughed at the very idea of it under any other circumstances.]
  7:  105| [45] [But there was not a single trace of a lie in Natsuhiko's voice and face at that moment.]
  8:  110| [47] [Watase]
  9:  111| [45] [(... Is that true?)]
 10:  134| [45] [He tried thinking that as a test, only to get an immediate telepathic reply.]
 11:  197| [85] [{Yeah, it is.}]
 12:  198| [86] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  199| [86] [{Yeah, it is.}]
 14:  242| [47] [Watase]
 15:  243| [45] [(--!)]
 16:  248| [45] [There was no longer any room for doubt.]
 17:  253| [45] [Natsuhiko was reading Watase's mind and talking directly into it!]
 18:  258| [47] [Watase]
 19:  259| [45] [(So people like this really do exist...!?)]
 20:  264| [45] [Suddenly, the seemingly normal boy who'd been standing before him now looked like a monster wielding a mysterious power in Watase's eyes.]
 21:  269| [45] [And seeing as how she didn't look surprised in the slightest--]
 22:  293| [45] [--perhaps Yuuri also had the same power.]
 23:  348| [47] [Watase]
 24:  351| [45] ["Na... Natsuhiko."]
 25:  356| [45] [Watase called out to Natsuhiko in a shaky voice.]
 26:  364| [47] [Watase]
 27:  367| [45] ["If it's true that you erased my memories... then is it possible for you to restore them?"]
 28:  393| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  396| [45] ["Yeah, of course."]
 30:  404| [47] [Watase]
 31:  407| [45] ["Th-then please do it!"]
 32:  415| [47] [Watase]
 33:  418| [45] ["The key to all these unsolved mysteries should be in my memories!"]
 34:  444| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  447| [45] ["You're probably right. But..."]
 36:  473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 37:  476| [45] ["If I'm going be totally honest here, I don't want to do it."]
 38:  504| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  507| [45] ["You understand what I'm getting at...!?"]
 40:  530| [47] [Watase]
 41:  533| [45] ["!?"]
 42:  620| [45] [Watase pondered the meaning of those words.]
 43:  625| [45] [Why wouldn't Natsuhiko want to give him back his memories? He could think of only one answer for that.]
 44:  677| [47] [Watase]
 45:  678| [45] [(So I really am... the one who attacked Natsuhiko and his friends.)]
 46:  728| [47] [Watase]
 47:  729| [45] [(So he erased my memories and rendered me powerless in order to protect himself!)]
 48:  734| [45] [Watase wanted to collapse onto his knees right then and there.]
 49:  784| [45] [If that was true, then that meant the gun Watase had found lying near Natsuhiko in Area N most likely belonged to Watase himself.]
 50:  789| [45] [He'd used it to shoot Natsuhiko and left it there.]
 51:  805| [45] [If his theory was correct, then it explained everything. All the pieces had fallen into place.]
 52:  810| [47] [Watase]
 53:  811| [45] [(... Shit!)]
 54:  816| [45] [Watase gritted his teeth.]
 55:  821| [45] [He had no idea what kind of person he'd been before his amnesia, but there was no doubt he'd been a wicked man.]
 56:  826| [45] [That thought made Watase's heart feel like it would shatter into millions of pieces.]
 57:  831| [47] [Watase]
 58:  832| [45] [(Then does that mean I don't have a chance in hell of earning their trust?)]
 59:  837| [45] [Trust-- that was the one thing Watase wanted more than anything else at the moment.]
 60:  842| [45] [There was absolutely no way he could rescue the ones he wished to save if they didn't trust him.]
 61:  847| [45] [He'd have to show them his resolve in order to gain that trust.]
 62:  852| [47] [Watase]
 63:  853| [45] [(Yes, that's right... the resolve to cast away my own life...)]
 64:  858| [47] [Watase]
 65:  859| [45] [(But how do I show them that the "past me" and the "current me" are different...? Wait, I know...!)]
 66:  864| [45] [He absolutely could not put himself above them.]
 67:  869| [45] [Watase then thought about the object in his breast pocket.]
 68:  921| [45] [--The pistol.]
 69:  926| [45] [It was the only way.]
 70:  944| [47] [Watase]
 71:  947| [45] ["Natsuhiko..."]
 72: 1019| [45] [Watase resolved himself and took out the gun.]
 73: 1095| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 74: 1098| [45] ["!"]
 75: 1159| [47] [Yuuri]
 76: 1162| [45] ["Kyaa!"]
 77: 1185| [45] [Their faces warped with fright. Natsuhiko stepped forward to protect Yuuri.]
 78: 1190| [45] [But Watase calmly held out the gun--]
 79: 1238| [45] [--and gently presented it to Natsuhiko.]
 80: 1246| [47] [Watase]
 81: 1249| [45] ["Take this. And then restore my memories for me after that."]
 82: 1275| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 83: 1278| [45] ["... Huh?"]
 84: 1286| [47] [Watase]
 85: 1289| [45] ["Your greatest fear is the chance that I'll attack you guys 'again' once I get my memories back, right?"]
 86: 1350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1353| [45] ["...!"]
 88: 1361| [47] [Watase]
 89: 1364| [45] ["So this is just a precaution..."]
 90: 1372| [47] [Watase]
 91: 1375| [45] ["If I try to attack you as soon as I get my memories back, then shoot me down. Don't hesitate."]
 92: 1401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1404| [45] ["Wha... What!?"]
 94: 1412| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1415| [45] ["It sounds like my old self is a rather untrustworthy son of a bitch."]
 96: 1423| [47] [Watase]
 97: 1426| [45] ["But the current me..."]
 98: 1431| [45] [... is probably different. Watase believed that.]
 99: 1436| [45] [But nothing he ever said right now could convince them of that. So he had to express himself through actions rather than words.]
100: 1444| [47] [Watase]
101: 1447| [45] ["... Please. This is the only way I can show you my sincerity."]
102: 1455| [47] [Watase]
103: 1458| [45] ["I'd rather die than kill you guys."]
104: 1484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
105: 1487| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi...!"]
106: 1492| [45] [The earnesty of his plea seemed to finally draw a hint of trust out of Natsuhiko.]
107: 1515| [45] [Natsuhiko timidly stretched his hand out--]
108: 1526| [45] [--and took the gun.]
