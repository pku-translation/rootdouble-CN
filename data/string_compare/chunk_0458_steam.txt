  0:   64| [45] [--Salyu stayed in a hotel on her first day in Rokumei City.]
  1:   69| [45] [There, she received an informative lecture on the usage of ARMS and various points of caution relating to her new life.]
  2:   74| [45] [The next morning, Dr. Tenkawa took her from the hotel to the school.]
  3:  112| [45] [The circumstances were unclear, but according to the professor, Rokumei Academy was the only school that would admit Salyu.]
  4:  117| [45] [It was a little disheartening to stand in front of the school. Dr. Tenkawa had accompanied her all the way to the school gate, but Salyu was on her own from there on.]
  5:  166| [47] [Salyu]
  6:  167| [45] [(I don't know if this will go well...)]
  7:  172| [45] [As Salyu nervously waited in front of the classroom, she was addressed by the homeroom teacher who greeted her earlier.]
  8:  177| [47] [Ena]
  9:  180| [45] ["Indeed she is. Now then, Ms. Sannomiya, please come in~"]
 10:  185| [45] [Salyu fired herself up and entered the classroom as instructed.]
 11:  311| [47] [Ena]
 12:  314| [45] ["Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself now."]
 13:  319| [47] [Salyu]
 14:  322| [45] ["Louise Yui Sannomiya."]
 15:  327| [45] [--And thus, she somehow managed to handle the hurdle of introducing herself.]
 16:  370| [45] [But Salyu was afraid of the crowd of students in the classroom.]
 17:  440| [45] [And once homeroom ended--]
 18:  532| [47] [Mashiro]
 19:  535| [45] ["Hey, bonjour! Mademoiselle Louise?"]
 20:  540| [45] [An energetic girl called out to her.]
 21:  546| [45] [The sudden voice startled Salyu.]
 22:  551| [45] [It was "Mashiro Toba". She said she wanted to be Salyu's friend.]
 23:  556| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  557| [45] [(... Really? I hope she's not plotting anything.)]
 25:  608| [45] [Salyu sank into paranoia for a second before suddenly realizing something important:%Nthis girl seemed to be that "friend of Natsuhiko's" that the professor mentioned.]
 26:  613| [45] [Natsuhiko himself was nearby. In that case, Salyu thought it'd be best for her to make friends with them.]
 27:  618| [45] [Once Salyu agreed to be their friend, Mashiro jumped for joy.]
 28:  626| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  629| [45] ["Now, then, what should we call you?"]
 30:  637| [47] [Mashiro]
 31:  640| [45] ["Oh, I know! 'Salyu'. How's that!?"]
 32:  725| [45] [Salyu nodded honestly to that suggestion.]
 33:  730| [47] [Salyu]
 34:  733| [45] ["It's certainly a cute name... And it has a deep meaning."]
 35:  759| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  762| [45] ["Huh?"]
 37:  767| [47] [Salyu]
 38:  770| [45] ["'Salut' is French for 'hi'."]
 39:  775| [47] [Salyu]
 40:  778| [45] ["A salutation. The beginning of communication."]
 41:  783| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  786| [45] ["It's like an encouraging boost to my perseverance."]
 43:  812| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  815| [45] ["Your perseverance? In regards to communication?"]
 45:  820| [47] [Salyu]
 46:  823| [45] ["Yes. I want to be friends with you guys."]
 47:  828| [47] [Salyu]
 48:  831| [45] ["But to be honest, I'm not good at that sort of thing."]
 49:  857| [47] [Mashiro]
 50:  860| [45] ["What are you talking about? We're getting through to each other right now, aren't we!?"]
 51:  865| [47] [Salyu]
 52:  868| [45] ["... Are we?"]
 53:  894| [47] [Mashiro]
 54:  897| [45] ["We are. Aren't we, Natsuhiko?"]
 55:  923| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 56:  926| [45] ["Hmm... Yeah, I guess so."]
 57:  931| [45] [Salyu secretly rejoiced at their words.]
 58:  936| [47] [Salyu]
 59:  937| [45] [(Perfect first contact... I'm already friends with these two.)]
 60:  942| [45] [That good feeling heralded the start of Salyu's new life.]
 61:  950| [47] [Salyu]
 62:  953| [45] ["Hmm... well, I don't see why not."]
 63:  958| [47] [Salyu]
 64:  959| [45] [(Actually... it's a rather beautiful nickname.)]
 65:  964| [45] ["Salyu" was pronounced like "Salut", which was French for "hi".]
 66:  969| [47] [Salyu]
 67:  970| [45] [(A salutation. The beginning of communication... It's like an encouraging boost to my perseverance.)]
 68:  975| [47] [Salyu]
 69:  976| [45] [(I feel like my first contact with them went by pretty well too.)]
 70:  981| [45] [Salyu was secretly full of joy.]
 71:  986| [45] [And thus began her new life.]
 72: 1082| [45] [--But the day's lessons ended before she really had any good opportunities to have a nice and slow conversation with them.]
 73: 1149| [45] [After the PRC field trip, Salyu had Dr. Tenkawa pick her up.]
 74: 1160| [45] [She waited by the side of the building for a while and eventually, the professor's car approached and stopped.]
 75: 1192| [47] [Miyoko]
 76: 1195| [45] ["Good work today, Yui."]
 77: 1200| [47] [Salyu]
 78: 1203| [45] ["Ah, Professor."]
 79: 1229| [47] [Miyoko]
 80: 1232| [45] ["How was your first day at school?"]
 81: 1237| [47] [Salyu]
 82: 1240| [45] ["Mmm, I'm tired... but I did establish contact with Natsuhiko and Mashiro."]
 83: 1248| [47] [Miyoko]
 84: 1251| [45] ["Good. Just as planned. Were you able to get along with them?"]
 85: 1256| [47] [Salyu]
 86: 1259| [45] ["Quite. We're already friends now."]
 87: 1282| [47] [Miyoko]
 88: 1283| [45] ["..."]
 89: 1288| [47] [Alice]
 90: 1291| [45] ["Kyuu~n..."]
 91: 1296| [45] [Suddenly, ARMS cried anxiously.]
 92: 1301| [47] [Salyu]
 93: 1304| [45] ["Professor, you're feeling anxious? Why?"]
 94: 1330| [47] [Miyoko]
 95: 1333| [45] ["N-no, it's just your imagination..."]
 96: 1338| [47] [Salyu]
 97: 1341| [45] ["?"]
 98: 1346| [45] [Perhaps even ARMS was capable of making a misjudgment.]
 99: 1351| [45] [The professor didn't seem to have anything to be anxious about, in any case.]
100: 1377| [47] [Miyoko]
101: 1380| [45] ["Anyway, starting from today, you'll be living at my house. Let's head over there."]
102: 1388| [47] [Miyoko]
103: 1391| [45] ["I'm fairly sure that not even that boy will object..."]
104: 1396| [47] [Salyu]
105: 1399| [45] ["Understood."]
106: 1470| [45] [But once they had gone to the Tenkawa residence and reunited with Natsuhiko and Mashiro--]
107: 1558| [45] [Natsuhiko objected to Salyu moving in.]
108: 1563| [47] [Salyu]
109: 1564| [45] [(That's strange... Nobody told me to expect this development.)]
110: 1569| [47] [Salyu]
111: 1570| [45] [(But I thought we were already friends. I haven't even touched on the phantom subject.)]
112: 1575| [45] [But the professor quickly departed, leaving the confused Salyu to her own devices.]
113: 1598| [47] [Salyu]
114: 1601| [45] ["Is it a bother for me to live in this house?"]
115: 1606| [47] [Salyu]
116: 1609| [45] ["This isn't what the professor said would happen. She said you guys wouldn't object."]
117: 1635| [47] [Natsuhiko]
118: 1638| [45] ["...!"]
119: 1643| [45] [Salyu twitched in fear when she saw that expression on Natsuhiko's face.]
120: 1648| [47] [Salyu]
121: 1649| [45] [(Even someone like me can understand that expression...)]
122: 1654| [45] [Natsuhiko was mad. And Salyu had a feeling she knew to whom that anger was directed.]
123: 1659| [47] [Salyu]
124: 1660| [45] [(It can't be... Am I... a nuisance...?)]
125: 1711| [45] [The thought saddened her.]
126: 1716| [45] [The happiness she had finally gained had suddenly withered.]
127: 1795| [45] [In a desperate effort to open her heart to Natsuhiko even just a little, she even tried talking to him about her role, but--]
128: 1800| [47] [Salyu]
129: 1803| [45] ["I was sent here to protect you, after all."]
130: 1829| [47] [Natsuhiko]
131: 1832| [45] ["Huh...? You... protect me?"]
132: 1916| [45] [--as she looked at the confused Natsuhiko, Salyu thought to herself.]
133: 1921| [47] [Salyu]
134: 1922| [45] [(Did I not explain sufficiently? Maybe I need to give more details.)]
135: 1927| [47] [Salyu]
136: 1930| [45] ["... Basically, it's my duty to protect you."]
137: 1935| [47] [Salyu]
138: 1938| [45] ["I'm not doing it unwillingly. I want to."]
139: 1964| [47] [Natsuhiko]
140: 1967| [45] ["Huh...? Wh-why?"]
141: 1972| [47] [Salyu]
142: 1975| [45] ["... Don't know. Just am."]
143: 2001| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2004| [45] ["Y-you just are?"]
145: 2009| [47] [Salyu]
146: 2012| [45] ["But I really do want to protect you."]
147: 2038| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2041| [45] ["I-I see. Hahah... Thanks."]
149: 2046| [45] [Natsuhiko laughed dryly. It confused Salyu.]
150: 2051| [47] [Salyu]
151: 2052| [45] [(... It's not like I said anything funny.)]
152: 2078| [47] [Natsuhiko]
153: 2081| [45] ["Well, anyway... I'm not so weak that I need a girl to protect me."]
154: 2107| [47] [Natsuhiko]
155: 2110| [45] ["How about we head back?"]
156: 2115| [47] [Salyu]
157: 2118| [45] ["... Mm."]
158: 2123| [45] [Despite Salyu's sincere efforts to talk to him, Natsuhiko's reaction was unclear.]
159: 2128| [45] [Salyu had a hard time understanding anything that was on his mind.]
160: 2136| [45] [Natsuhiko only stared blankly. He didn't seem happy at all.]
161: 2141| [47] [Salyu]
162: 2142| [45] [(He really isn't accepting me...)]
163: 2147| [47] [Salyu]
164: 2148| [45] [(Why does he have to be so cruel to me? I've done nothing wrong...)]
165: 2153| [45] [Salyu couldn't understand a thing that was on Natsuhiko's mind.]
166: 2225| [45] [--And thus, the first day of Salyu's new life came to an anxious end.]
167: 2230| [45] [She was wondering if things could get worse from there, but--]
168: 2334| [45] [Starting the next day, things took a turn for the better.]
169: 2339| [45] [She went shopping with Natsuhiko and Mashiro and opened her heart to them a little bit...]
170: 2344| [45] [And after Natsuhiko asked her about how they had met at the scene of the accident two days prior, Salyu gathered the courage to tell him about her weakness.]
171: 2349| [47] [Salyu]
172: 2352| [45] ["... To be honest, I'm very poor at understanding the nuances of people's emotions and facial expressions."]
173: 2357| [47] [Salyu]
174: 2360| [45] ["It's thanks to this thing that I can finally communicate properly with people."]
175: 2426| [45] [And with that, she showed ARMS to Natsuhiko.]
176: 2468| [47] [Salyu]
177: 2471| [45] ["That's why I was uneasy about adapting to a new life. But with ARMS, I think I can somehow manage."]
178: 2497| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2500| [45] ["... So that's how it was."]
180: 2551| [45] [Natsuhiko fell silent at Salyu's words for a few moments before timidly speaking up.]
181: 2577| [47] [Natsuhiko]
182: 2580| [45] ["Say, Salyu..."]
183: 2585| [47] [Salyu]
184: 2588| [45] ["What?"]
185: 2614| [47] [Natsuhiko]
186: 2617| [45] ["Umm, well... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for always acting so hostile towards you."]
187: 2622| [47] [Salyu]
188: 2625| [45] ["... Mm."]
189: 2711| [45] [When Salyu nodded awkwardly, Mashiro spoke up beside her.]
190: 2737| [47] [Mashiro]
191: 2740| [45] ["Hmm, that's great. We've cleared up all those misunderstandings. So now we can begin our friendship anew, right?"]
192: 2766| [47] [Natsuhiko]
193: 2769| [45] ["Hey... don't say stuff like that. You ruined the mood."]
194: 2774| [45] [Despite what Natsuhiko said, Salyu was deeply moved by one of the words Mashiro had said.]
195: 2779| [47] [Salyu]
196: 2782| [45] ["Friendship... such a lovely word."]
197: 2823| [47] [Natsuhiko & Mashiro]
198: 2826| [45] ["Huh?"]
199: 2831| [47] [Salyu]
200: 2834| [45] ["Natsuhiko. Mashiro. Let me ask. Are we friends?"]
201: 2860| [47] [Natsuhiko]
202: 2863| [45] ["Huh? I-I guess..."]
203: 2889| [47] [Mashiro]
204: 2892| [45] ["Of course we are, Salyu! Didn't we say that when we first met too?"]
205: 2903| [47] [Salyu]
206: 2906| [45] ["..."]
207: 2911| [45] [Salyu felt her heart pound.]
208: 2916| [45] [She was happy to hear Mashiro's straightforward reply.]
209: 2924| [45] [It was still an awkwardly stilted conversation-- but it didn't feel unpleasant at all.]
210: 2968| [47] [Salyu]
211: 2969| [45] [(I've learned something... The key to good communication might be honesty.)]
212: 2974| [47] [Salyu]
213: 2975| [45] [(You should open up your heart and come in contact with others, even if they seem scary.)]
214: 2980| [45] [That was an epiphany to Salyu.]
215: 3053| [45] [And that night, Mashiro threw a welcome party for Salyu.]
216: 3058| [47] [Mashiro]
217: 3061| [45] ["Okay, thanks for waiting!"]
218: 3112| [47] [Natsuhiko]
219: 3115| [45] ["W-whoaaah~!!"]
220: 3189| [47] [Salyu]
221: 3192| [45] ["... Magnificent."]
222: 3197| [45] [The food was very delicious, but above all else, it was Mashiro's consideration that delighted Salyu.]
223: 3281| [47] [Salyu]
224: 3284| [45] ["... Um, Mashiro. Thank you for making all this magnificent food."]
225: 3310| [47] [Mashiro]
226: 3313| [45] ["Nah, nah, it's no trouble at all. I like doing this."]
227: 3339| [47] [Mashiro]
228: 3342| [45] ["Besides, delicious food really does bring people closer together."]
229: 3347| [47] [Salyu]
230: 3350| [45] ["Agreed."]
231: 3355| [45] [Salyu and Mashiro smiled at each other.]
232: 3360| [47] [Salyu]
233: 3361| [45] [(Odd... I feel relaxed when I'm with Mashiro.)]
234: 3366| [45] [She had never felt that way with anyone else besides Dr. Tenkawa.]
235: 3371| [45] [When she tried to think of why she felt that way with Mashiro too, Salyu quickly found the reason.]
236: 3376| [47] [Salyu]
237: 3377| [45] [(I know... It's because Mashiro's gentle and she's not two-faced.)]
238: 3382| [47] [Salyu]
239: 3385| [45] ["Mashiro."]
240: 3411| [47] [Mashiro]
241: 3414| [45] ["Hmm?"]
242: 3419| [47] [Salyu]
243: 3422| [45] ["I love you, Mashiro."]
244: 3448| [47] [Mashiro]
245: 3451| [45] ["Huh!? I-is that a confession?"]
246: 3456| [47] [Salyu]
247: 3459| [45] ["I tried expressing my feelings honestly. Did I do bad?"]
248: 3485| [47] [Mashiro]
249: 3488| [45] ["No, no, not at all! I love you too, Salyu."]
250: 3499| [45] [When Mashiro said that, Alice cried "kyukkyuu".]
251: 3504| [45] [A cry denoting an amicable emotion-- Salyu thought to herself as she heard that.]
252: 3509| [47] [Salyu]
253: 3510| [45] [(Alice's judgment largely matches Mashiro's words.)]
254: 3515| [47] [Salyu]
255: 3516| [45] [(Everything she says seems to be genuine.)]
256: 3521| [45] [Salyu placed her utmost trust in Alice.]
257: 3526| [45] [And going by Alice's judgment, Salyu thought she could place unconditional trust in Mashiro as well.]
258: 3534| [47] [Salyu]
259: 3535| [45] [(She's gentle and she doesn't hide behind a mask... Her speech and conduct match almost perfectly with Alice's judgment.)]
260: 3540| [47] [Salyu]
261: 3541| [45] [(Everything she says seems to be genuine.)]
262: 3546| [45] [Even though Salyu couldn't understand the minds of others, she felt like she could believe Mashiro unconditionally.]
263: 3642| [45] [Afterwards, they all talked about novels and had a fun time.]
264: 3727| [45] [Once Mashiro went home, Salyu tried asking Natsuhiko a question.]
265: 3732| [47] [Salyu]
266: 3735| [45] ["--It looked to me like everyone had fun today. Did you have fun, Natsuhiko?"]
267: 3761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
268: 3764| [45] ["Huh? W-well, of course. Did you have a bad time, Salyu?"]
269: 3769| [47] [Salyu]
270: 3772| [45] ["... No."]
271: 3777| [47] [Salyu]
272: 3780| [45] ["I had a lot of fun too."]
273: 3803| [45] [When Salyu said that with a smile, Natsuhiko smiled back.]
274: 3808| [45] [If only days like this could continue forever... That's what Salyu wished.]
275: 3886| [45] [--But that peace did not last long.]
276: 3891| [45] [The next night, Natsuhiko and Mashiro got into a fight, even though Salyu had thought they were getting along.]
277: 3973| [47] [Mashiro]
278: 3976| [45] ["I can't count on you for anything anymore, Natsuhiko! Goodbye!"]
279: 3985| [47] [Natsuhiko]
280: 3988| [45] ["H-hey, wait a second, Mashiro!"]
281: 3993| [45] [And the next day--]
282: 4087| [45] [Salyu herself got into a fight with Natsuhiko.]
283: 4092| [47] [Salyu]
284: 4095| [45] ["If you don't believe Mashiro, then why don't you just leave her alone?"]
285: 4103| [47] [Natsuhiko]
286: 4106| [45] ["Hey... don't you think you're being a little too cold?"]
287: 4132| [47] [Natsuhiko]
288: 4135| [45] ["You're not gonna make any friends like that."]
289: 4155| [47] [Salyu]
290: 4158| [45] ["..."]
291: 4163| [45] [Those words gouged out Salyu's heart.]
292: 4168| [45] [She had never expected one of her first ever friends to say that to her.]
293: 4173| [47] [Salyu]
294: 4174| [45] [(Ah, but... if I talk to him honestly, then maybe...)]
295: 4179| [45] [Once she got that idea, Salyu talked once more about her peculiar trait.]
296: 4184| [45] [About the dysfunctional part of her brain.]
297: 4189| [45] [And how as a result, she couldn't understand other people's feelings in the slightest--]
298: 4212| [47] [Salyu]
299: 4215| [45] ["I came to Japan, met all of you, and had fun, but... at times, I've also been confused, and also scared."]
300: 4220| [47] [Salyu]
301: 4223| [45] ["Perhaps I really wasn't meant to interact with other people."]
302: 4228| [45] [Salyu spoke on the verge of tears-- but Natsuhiko replied in a subdued voice.]
303: 4254| [47] [Natsuhiko]
304: 4257| [45] ["... Don't tell yourself you weren't meant to interact with other people."]
305: 4265| [47] [Natsuhiko]
306: 4268| [45] ["It's true that we can't understand other people's feelings."]
307: 4276| [47] [Natsuhiko]
308: 4279| [45] ["When I say we can't understand other people's feelings, I don't just mean you and me, Salyu. Nobody truly can."]
309: 4284| [47] [Salyu]
310: 4287| [45] ["Huh...!?"]
311: 4292| [47] [Salyu]
312: 4295| [45] ["It's not just me... but everyone?"]
313: 4321| [47] [Natsuhiko]
314: 4324| [45] ["That's right. But don't you think... we should still try our best to understand each other regardless?"]
315: 4332| [47] [Natsuhiko]
316: 4335| [45] ["... You don't need a full understanding of what's on other people's minds. But as long as you keep striving for it... In other words, as long as you keep other people in consideration..."]
317: 4343| [47] [Natsuhiko]
318: 4346| [45] ["Then I'm sure things will turn out for the best. Both for you and for those you interact with..."]
319: 4354| [47] [Natsuhiko]
320: 4357| [45] ["And unless you afford that kindness to others, nobody will be kind to you, will they?"]
321: 4408| [45] [--Those words reverberated in Salyu's mind.]
322: 4413| [47] [Salyu]
323: 4414| [45] [(I see. If everyone's the same way... then I'm just wasting my time worrying about it alone.)]
324: 4419| [47] [Salyu]
325: 4420| [45] [(Perhaps Natsuhiko has the same sort of worries I do inside.)]
326: 4425| [47] [Salyu]
327: 4426| [45] [(He overcame those worries to say all that...)]
328: 4431| [47] [Salyu]
329: 4432| [45] [(... Is this what it means to sympathize with someone??)]
330: 4516| [47] [Salyu]
331: 4519| [45] ["... Natsuhiko."]
332: 4545| [47] [Natsuhiko]
333: 4548| [45] ["Hmm?"]
334: 4553| [47] [Salyu]
335: 4556| [45] ["Were you sympathizing with me?"]
336: 4582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
337: 4585| [45] ["Yeah, in my own way."]
338: 4590| [45] [Natsuhiko responded clearly.]
339: 4601| [45] [Alice's reaction showed that his words were the truth as well.]
340: 4606| [47] [Salyu]
341: 4607| [45] [(So Natsuhiko and I really are the same...!)]
342: 4612| [45] [--For the first time, Salyu felt like she understood Natsuhiko's mind.]
343: 4620| [45] [At that time, Salyu felt like she gained at least a slight understanding of Natsuhiko's incomprehensible boyish mind.]
344: 4625| [47] [Salyu]
345: 4626| [45] [(Then I need to respond... by trying to sympathize with Natsuhiko too.)]
346: 4673| [45] [Salyu reconciled with Natsuhiko and the two of them decided to search for Mashiro together.]
347: 4706| [47] [Salyu]
348: 4709| [45] ["--Let's calm down and think about a way to find her. I'll help."]
349: 4735| [47] [Natsuhiko]
350: 4738| [45] ["Yeah!"]
351: 4806| [45] [They regrouped with Mashiro in front of the melancholic city gate--]
352: 4863| [45] [They searched for terrorists and trespassed into the PRC.]
353: 4923| [45] [And as a result of a misunderstanding there, they became a target for the security department,]
354: 4980| [45] [and thus they spent the night at a karaoke box.]
355: 5023| [45] [Salyu's life began to take a huge change.]
356: 5028| [45] [She couldn't recommend Natsuhiko and Mashiro stepping into danger, but in the corner of her mind, she enjoyed it.]
357: 5033| [47] [Salyu]
358: 5034| [45] [(... It's kind of like an adventure...)]
359: 5039| [47] [Salyu]
360: 5040| [45] [(It might possibly contradict my role, but I think I might like this sort of thing.)]
361: 5098| [45] [--The adventure continued to the next day.]
362: 5146| [45] [After they encountered the PRC explosion, they realized that the enemy's real target was LABO's nuclear reactor--]
363: 5203| [45] [And they confronted the terrorists at the ruined factory.]
364: 5253| [45] [They suffered a temporary defeat, but once they woke up from being knocked out, the three kids talked.]
365: 5258| [45] [Natsuhiko decided to head to LABO to prevent the terrorist plot.]
366: 5263| [45] [And so Salyu and Mashiro chose to cooperate with him as well.]
367: 5359| [47] [Natsuhiko]
368: 5362| [45] ["Aagh, geez... How can you two be so stubborn...!?"]
369: 5370| [47] [Mashiro]
370: 5373| [45] ["I don't want to hear it from you, Natsuhiko. The three of us just have the same idea in mind."]
371: 5378| [47] [Salyu]
372: 5381| [45] ["Total agreement."]
373: 5419| [45] [And then the kids smiled at each other.]
374: 5424| [45] [They eventually sorted out their story.]
375: 5450| [47] [Natsuhiko]
376: 5453| [45] ["... Okay, then. Ready, guys?"]
377: 5458| [47] [Salyu]
378: 5461| [45] ["Roger."]
379: 5487| [47] [Mashiro]
380: 5490| [45] ["Mmm, I'm ready to go when you are."]
381: 5516| [47] [Natsuhiko]
382: 5519| [45] ["Let's go, to protect the city...!"]
383: 5524| [45] [Salyu nodded and broke off into a dash.]
384: 5529| [45] [Alongside the two precious friends that fate had brought to her in that city.]
385: 5657| [45] [--Salyu and the others walked on the overpass leading to LABO.]
386: 5663| [45] [The three of them strove along the long distance.]
387: 5714| [45] [The Summer Triangle shone up high in the night sky as if to guide them--]
388: 5720| [45] [Those three lights seemed to symbolize the three of them--]
389: 5726| [47] [Salyu]
390: 5727| [45] [(No... perhaps I haven't yet joined those stars.)]
391: 5733| [45] [There was one other friend living in the minds of Natsuhiko and Mashiro.]
392: 5739| [45] [The girl who died nine years ago, Yuuri Kotono.]
393: 5745| [45] [For some reason, whenever she thought of that girl, even Salyu felt nostalgic and heartbroken.]
394: 5751| [47] [Salyu]
395: 5752| [45] [(... It's too late now, but I wish I knew more about her.)]
396: 5758| [47] [Salyu]
397: 5759| [45] [(Because the more I learn about Natsuhiko and Mashiro, the more my affection for them grows.)]
398: 5765| [47] [Salyu]
399: 5766| [45] [(I guess I'll ask them after this incident's over.)]
400: 5772| [45] [She would ask them about their memories of the friend she'd never meet--]
401: 6006| [45] [--As Salyu's feelings for Natsuhiko, Mashiro, and Yuuri intensify within her--]
402: 6011| [45] [A new memory rises up from the innermost depths of her mind...]
