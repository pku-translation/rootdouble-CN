  2:   61| [45] [----]
  3:   66| [45] [--]
  4:  115| [45] [--Natsuhiko and Yuuri returned to reality.]
  5:  120| [45] [The first thing Natsuhiko saw...]
  6:  159| [45] [... was Jun, slowly falling down with the engine cutter still in hand.]
  7:  176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  8:  179| [45] ["Jun!"]
  9:  205| [45] [Natsuhiko promptly caught Jun by her hand.]
 10:  210| [45] [An intense shock ran through his body and pain ran through his wounds-- and yet he still did not let go.]
 11:  215| [45] [But his body wasn't the only thing in pain.]
 12:  317| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  320| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
 14:  325| [45] [Pain ran through his head again just like what happened when he had erased the Subject N inside of Ukita.]
 15:  368| [45] [He was also struck with that bizarre discomfort that seemed like his brain was being shaken.]
 16:  373| [45] [The pain and discomfort were clearly more intense this time.]
 17:  399| [47] [Yuuri]
 18:  402| [45] ["H-Hikorin? Don't tell me it's happening ag--"]
 19:  488| [45] [Yuuri raised her voice when she noticed something wrong with Natsuhiko-- but he promptly replied with telepathy.]
 20:  502| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  505| [45] [{Yuuri, please don't bring that up now!}]
 22:  531| [47] [Yuuri]
 23:  534| [45] ["!?"]
 24:  542| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 25:  545| [45] [{Just as I feared, it looks like my brain takes damage each time I come in contact with Subject N.}]
 26:  553| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  556| [45] [{But please don't say that out loud here. It'll just make everyone worry. It won't improve our fortunes at all.}]
 28:  564| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 29:  567| [45] [{So please, let's keep this a secret.}]
 30:  590| [45] [Yuuri looked at Natsuhiko in worry... but she eventually replied with telepathy.]
 31:  613| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  616| [45] [{... Okay. But... please, don't force yourself...}]
 33:  621| [45] [Natsuhiko nodded at those words.]
 34:  720| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  721| [45] [(... Don't force myself, huh...)]
 36:  726| [45] [He appreciated the sentiment, but there was no way he could take Yuuri up on those words.]
 37:  731| [45] [No matter how much damage his brain took, he had to keep fighting Subject N until everyone was free from malice.]
 38:  736| [45] [In the same way that Watase had tried to save everyone no matter how much damage his body took.]
 39:  824| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  825| [45] [(Hahah...! Now isn't that exciting?)]
 41:  830| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 42:  831| [45] [(Will my brain crumble first, or will I erase all of Subject N's malice first...? It's a battle of wits.)]
 43:  836| [45] [A smile of bravado formed on Natsuhiko's lips.]
 44:  852| [45] [Ena and Ukita called out to him as he waited for his headache to subside.]
 45:  893| [47] [Ena]
 46:  896| [45] ["... What's wrong, Mr. Tenkawa?"]
 47:  904| [47] [Ukita]
 48:  907| [45] ["D-do your wounds hurt?"]
 49:  915| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  918| [45] ["Yeah, a little... but Jun's more important now."]
 51:  979| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 52:  982| [45] ["Jun, are you okay? Jun?"]
 53:  987| [45] [After Natsuhiko called her name, Jun eventually groaned.]
 54:  995| [47] [Jun]
 55:  998| [45] ["... Mmm."]
 56: 1032| [47] [Jun]
 57: 1035| [45] ["... Huh, Natsuhiko? Yuuri...?"]
 58: 1040| [45] [With vacant eyes, Jun looked at each person in the shelter one by one--]
 59: 1045| [45] [And then, as if realizing something, she gasped.]
 60: 1071| [47] [Jun]
 61: 1074| [45] ["Wh... what have I done...?"]
 62: 1082| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1085| [45] ["Jun, are you fully conscious now?"]
 64: 1111| [47] [Jun]
 65: 1114| [45] ["Y-yeah... but..."]
 66: 1140| [47] [Jun]
 67: 1143| [45] ["That's odd... I was completely bonkers just a moment ago, wasn't I?"]
 68: 1151| [47] [Jun]
 69: 1154| [45] ["Did I just suddenly go back to normal or something...?"]
 70: 1159| [45] [Natsuhiko was relieved to hear those words from Jun.]
 71: 1167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1170| [45] ["That's fine, then. The you right now is the original you."]
 73: 1196| [47] [Jun]
 74: 1199| [45] ["The original me...?"]
 75: 1207| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 76: 1210| [45] ["Long story short, there's something in this facility that's caused people to become aggressive and paranoid, much like you were until just now..."]
 77: 1236| [47] [Jun]
 78: 1239| [45] ["Huh... Why's that?"]
 79: 1296| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 80: 1299| [45] ["That girl you found in front of the cargo lift-- she was was a powerful Communicator."]
 81: 1307| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 82: 1310| [45] ["She had the power to change the minds of those around her into ones full of malice."]
 83: 1318| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1321| [45] ["And because of that, everyone inside the facility went crazy."]
 85: 1354| [47] [Jun]
 86: 1357| [45] ["No way... BC has that sort of power...?"]
 87: 1365| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1368| [45] ["It does. Though do I realize how unbelievable it is."]
 89: 1373| [45] [Jun looked a bit dubious for a while, but--]
 90: 1399| [47] [Jun]
 91: 1402| [45] ["... Judging by what happened to me, I guess I have to believe it, huh..."]
 92: 1428| [47] [Jun]
 93: 1431| [45] ["Wait, did Mr. Ukita go crazy for the same reason?"]
 94: 1458| [47] [Ukita]
 95: 1461| [45] ["Yeah... But having said that, I don't expect you to forgive me for attacking you."]
 96: 1466| [45] [Ukita and Jun looked at each other awkwardly.]
 97: 1471| [45] [A little while later, Jun politely bowed her head.]
 98: 1503| [47] [Jun]
 99: 1506| [45] ["No... I should be the one to apologize. I chased you around with an engine cutter and said extremely rude things..."]
100: 1532| [47] [Ukita]
101: 1535| [45] ["No, it's okay... I deserved at least that much disparagement."]
102: 1540| [45] [It seemed that the discord between the two of them was settled for now.]
103: 1599| [45] [Ena took a deep breath and whispered to Natsuhiko.]
104: 1625| [47] [Ena]
105: 1628| [45] ["Thanks for trusting me, Mr. Tenkawa. Looks like you were able to tie things up."]
106: 1636| [47] [Natsuhiko]
107: 1639| [45] ["No... it's all thanks to you, Professor."]
108: 1665| [47] [Yuuri]
109: 1668| [45] ["It was a really big help that you weren't infected with malice, Ms. Ena."]
110: 1673| [45] [Natsuhiko and Yuuri bowed their heads in gratitude.]
111: 1699| [47] [Ena]
112: 1702| [45] ["Don't be foolish, you two. It's too early to celebrate, you know?"]
113: 1710| [47] [Natsuhiko]
114: 1713| [45] ["... Huh?"]
115: 1739| [47] [Ena]
116: 1742| [45] ["Judging by what we saw of Ms. Moribe, those infected with malice aren't aware of it themselves, right?"]
117: 1750| [47] [Ena]
118: 1753| [45] ["In that case, you can't be entirely sure that I'm not infected with malice, can you?"]
119: 1776| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 1779| [45] ["!?"]
121: 1815| [45] [Once Natsuhiko heard that, he promptly stood between Ena and Yuuri.]
122: 1844| [45] [But Ena just placed her gun on the floor and spoke with a smile.]
123: 1884| [47] [Ena]
124: 1887| [45] ["Don't panic. I'm probably not infected. But I still want you to check my mind just in case."]
125: 1895| [47] [Natsuhiko]
126: 1898| [45] ["You're serious? You're telling us to peek into your mind even though there's not a shred of evidence that you've been infected with malice?"]
127: 1903| [45] [He certainly felt guilty about doing something like that.]
128: 1908| [45] [But Ena tried to persuade him.]
129: 1934| [47] [Ena]
130: 1937| [45] ["Mr. Tenkawa, I understand why you don't like the idea. You've never liked the idea of using BC abilities in the first place, have you?"]
131: 1945| [47] [Natsuhiko]
132: 1948| [45] ["Huh...?"]
133: 1974| [47] [Ena]
134: 1977| [45] ["The reason you've been unable to manifest you BC abilities despite your Rank S Aptitude is because you've been rejecting them yourself."]
135: 1985| [47] [Ena]
136: 1988| [45] ["You've avoided trespassing into other people's minds this whole time, haven't you?"]
137: 1996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
138: 1999| [45] ["... I have."]
139: 2004| [45] [Now that he thought about it, Ena was exactly right.]
140: 2009| [45] [The manifestation of BC abilities was greatly affected by the user's "will". And that was why Natsuhiko's BC abilities had never flourished.]
141: 2017| [47] [Ena]
142: 2020| [45] ["But listen, Mr. Tenkawa. Now you can use BC at will. And that's because you believe that you need it right now."]
143: 2028| [47] [Natsuhiko]
144: 2031| [45] ["But... I don't believe that I need to peek into your mind now, Professor."]
145: 2057| [47] [Ena]
146: 2060| [45] ["No, you do. That's the only way I can completely gain your trust."]
147: 2068| [47] [Ena]
148: 2071| [45] ["After all, you and the others see me as suspicious, don't you?"]
149: 2079| [47] [Natsuhiko]
150: 2082| [45] ["..."]
151: 2105| [45] [Ena smiled wryly as Natsuhiko found himself at a loss for an answer.]
152: 2131| [47] [Ena]
153: 2134| [45] ["It's only natural. I've closed my heart to everybody and said nothing but lies."]
154: 2142| [47] [Ena]
155: 2145| [45] ["So much so that nothing I say really carries any weight anymore..."]
156: 2171| [47] [Ena]
157: 2174| [45] ["If you peek into my mind, I believe you'll be able to understand all of the thoughts behind my actions."]
158: 2179| [45] [Ena placed her hand on Natsuhiko's shoulder.]
159: 2205| [47] [Ena]
160: 2208| [45] ["... Memories don't tell lies. So dive into my mind and experience my life vicariously through them."]
161: 2216| [47] [Ena]
162: 2219| [45] ["I'm sure that you'll come to trust me if you do..."]
163: 2224| [45] [Indeed, that probably would help them understand her feelings.]
164: 2275| [45] [And allow them to learn Ena's true identity and the reason her heart was closed as well.]
165: 2280| [47] [Natsuhiko]
166: 2281| [45] [(But what should I do...? If I do go through with memory access, how exactly do I go about it?)]
167: 2286| [45] [What he needed to confirm was "Ena's true identity" and "what motivated her to mobilize in LABO today", as well as "whether or not she was infected with malice".]
168: 2291| [47] [Natsuhiko]
169: 2292| [45] [(Should I look in detail, or just do a quick check...?)]
170: 2297| [47] [Natsuhiko]
171: 2298| [45] [(I think it's best to keep exposure of other people's minds to a minimum, but...)]
172: 2382| [45] [That's what he thought for a second, but then another thought suddenly welled up in his gut.]
173: 2387| [47] [Natsuhiko]
174: 2388| [45] [(No... I really should learn about Prof. Tsubakiyama in detail. That seems to be what she wants too, after all...)]
175: 2393| [45] [And with that thought in mind, Natsuhiko declared to Ena.]
176: 2401| [47] [Natsuhiko]
177: 2404| [45] ["Understood... If you insist, I shall go ahead and peek through your memory, Professor."]
178: 2412| [47] [Natsuhiko]
179: 2415| [45] ["Please allow me to experience your life."]
180: 2420| [45] [And as Natsuhiko said that, Yuuri nodded beside him.]
181: 2447| [47] [Yuuri]
182: 2450| [45] ["Please allow me to do so as well. I want to believe you from the bottom of my heart, Professor..."]
183: 2455| [45] [Those words brought a gentle smile to the teacher's face.]
184: 2487| [47] [Ena]
185: 2490| [45] ["... Thanks, you two."]
186: 2516| [47] [Ena]
187: 2519| [45] ["I'll open my heart for real this time... And remember, what you see in my head is the truth of this country."]
188: 2524| [45] [And as Ena gave them that veiled warning, the kids walked up to her--]
189: 2536| [47] [Ena]
190: 2539| [45] ["Don't panic. I'm probably not infected. But I still want you to check my mind just in case."]
191: 2547| [47] [Natsuhiko]
192: 2550| [45] ["Just in case...?"]
193: 2576| [47] [Ena]
194: 2579| [45] ["Yes. Besides, doesn't it bother you kids how you don't know my true identity?"]
195: 2587| [47] [Natsuhiko]
196: 2590| [45] ["...!"]
197: 2595| [45] [Her true identity did indeed bother him.]
198: 2600| [45] [Ena said she was a member of something that was like a police, so it probably had something to do with that--]
199: 2651| [47] [Natsuhiko]
200: 2652| [45] [(What do I do...? How should I go about doing memory access this time around?)]
201: 2657| [45] [For now, what he needed to confirm was "Ena's true identity" and "what motivated her to mobilize in LABO today".]
202: 2662| [45] [As well as "whether or not she was infected with malice".]
203: 2667| [47] [Natsuhiko]
204: 2668| [45] [(Should I look in detail, or just do a quick check...?)]
205: 2673| [47] [Natsuhiko]
206: 2674| [45] [(I get the feeling I should just do a quick check, but...)]
207: 2758| [45] [That's what he thought for a second, but then another thought suddenly welled up in his gut.]
208: 2763| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 2764| [45] [(... No... I want to know about Prof. Tsubakiyama in detail.)]
210: 2769| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 2770| [45] [(There are too many mysteries about her, and besides...)]
212: 2775| [45] [He wanted to know more about who Ena was inside.]
213: 2783| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 2786| [45] ["... Understood. Allow me to peek into your memories, Professor."]
215: 2794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
216: 2797| [45] ["But it's not like I'm peeking because I doubt you or anything."]
217: 2824| [47] [Yuuri]
218: 2827| [45] ["Th-that's right. It's just so we can believe you from the bottoms of our hearts."]
219: 2832| [45] [Ena smiled at Natsuhiko's and Yuuri's words.]
220: 2864| [47] [Ena]
221: 2867| [45] ["... Thanks, you two."]
222: 2893| [47] [Ena]
223: 2896| [45] ["I'll open my heart for real this time... And remember, what you see in my head is the truth of this country."]
224: 2901| [45] [And as Ena gave them that veiled warning, the kids walked up to her--]
225: 2910| [47] [Natsuhiko]
226: 2911| [45] [(... Well, there's only a low probability of malice infection... so yeah, let's just do a quick check.)]
227: 2916| [45] [Natsuhiko focused on Ena and answered.]
228: 2924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
229: 2927| [45] ["... Okay. Allow me to just make a quick check."]
230: 2953| [47] [Ena]
231: 2956| [45] ["That's fine. It's better to have safety nets rather than rely on unconditional trust alone."]
232: 2963| [45] [And as Ena said that with a smile, the kids walked up to her--]
233: 3021| [45] [--and activated Senses Sympathy.]
