  0:   64| [45] [--Salyu and the others headed to LABO to stop the terrorist plot.]
  1:   69| [45] [But by the time they got there--]
  2:   74| [45] [It was already too late.]
  3:  189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  4:  192| [45] ["Wha!?"]
  5:  258| [47] [Mashiro]
  6:  261| [45] ["Kyaah!"]
  7:  291| [47] [Salyu]
  8:  294| [45] ["Ghh...!"]
  9:  356| [45] [--They missed the window of opportunity to stop the terrorist plot... by just a short amount of time.]
 10:  503| [45] [After they had descended to the basement floors of the blazing building, they searched for an exit and Dr. Tenkawa.]
 11:  508| [45] [But along the way, they ran into the terrorists--]
 12:  604| [47] [Salyu]
 13:  607| [45] ["Natsuhiko! Mashiro! Run!"]
 14:  612| [45] [Salyu promptly yelled.]
 15:  653| [47] [Mashiro]
 16:  656| [45] ["Salyu!?"]
 17:  661| [47] [Salyu]
 18:  664| [45] ["I'll get rid of him! The other one's fainted, so I can manage one-on-one combat!"]
 19:  690| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 20:  693| [45] ["Then let me help--!"]
 21:  698| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  701| [45] ["No, Natsuhiko, you guys will only drag me down!%NI can't deal with a hostage situation if they get you!"]
 23:  724| [47] [Salyu]
 24:  727| [45] ["You guys go find an exit! If you find one, contact me through telepathy!"]
 25:  732| [45] [Salyu had judged that to be the most logical course of action.]
 26:  827| [45] [But after Natsuhiko and Mashiro had fled and Salyu had knocked down the two terrorists, a new terrorist appeared.]
 27:  838| [45] [Salyu immediately dropkicked him, but the force of the impact merely shattered the enemy's faceplate.]
 28:  843| [45] [The third terrorist threw off his protection suit and spoke.]
 29:  914| [47] [Watase]
 30:  917| [45] ["... You again, huh."]
 31:  922| [47] [Salyu]
 32:  925| [45] ["... So we meet again."]
 33:  930| [45] [He was the man who had knocked Salyu out last night in the ruined factory.]
 34:  956| [47] [Watase]
 35:  959| [45] ["... Just a word of warning. Get out."]
 36:  967| [47] [Watase]
 37:  970| [45] ["Or the bulkheads will shut and trap your ass in here. The fires will get worse and you could even burn to death."]
 38:  978| [47] [Watase]
 39:  981| [45] ["Seems to me like you're trying to thwart our plan out of some childish sense of justice, but--"]
 40:  989| [47] [Watase]
 41:  992| [45] ["What good is fighting me if it means putting your body in such extreme danger?"]
 42:  997| [47] [Salyu]
 43: 1000| [45] ["...!"]
 44: 1005| [45] [Now he mentioned it, what -would- be the purpose of fighting this man?]
 45: 1010| [45] [That was already well beyond the scope of Salyu's role.]
 46: 1015| [47] [Salyu]
 47: 1016| [45] [(Why am I going so far to--)]
 48: 1094| [45] [Her thoughts were interrupted by a gunshot.]
 49: 1099| [47] [Salyu]
 50: 1102| [45] ["!!"]
 51: 1167| [45] [Her arm felt like it was on fire.]
 52: 1172| [47] [Salyu]
 53: 1173| [45] [(Crap...!)]
 54: 1178| [45] [When Salyu turned around in shock, she spotted one of the terrorists that she had flung away pointing his gun at her.]
 55: 1186| [47] [Watase]
 56: 1189| [45] ["Dumbass! The hell are you doing!? Shooting at a child--!?"]
 57: 1194| [47] [Dojima]
 58: 1197| [45] ["The hell are YOU doing!? There's no time to be standing around, is there!?"]
 59: 1202| [45] [The terrorists started quarreling.]
 60: 1213| [45] [Salyu took that opportunity to get out of there.]
 61: 1218| [47] [Salyu]
 62: 1219| [45] [(I can't win against guns! I need a weapon of my own...!)]
 63: 1279| [45] [With that thought in mind, she searched for Natsuhiko and Mashiro.]
 64: 1346| [45] [They found each other at opposite sides of a wrecked emergency staircase.]
 65: 1351| [45] [Salyu spoke as the other two worried about her.]
 66: 1356| [47] [Salyu]
 67: 1359| [45] ["The enemy has exceptional physical strength and unknown numbers... Our odds don't look good."]
 68: 1473| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 69: 1476| [45] ["Okay, Salyu, then come down here! Let's escape together!"]
 70: 1481| [47] [Salyu]
 71: 1484| [45] ["No, I can't climb down with this arm. I think it'd be difficult for you guys to climb up too."]
 72: 1489| [47] [Salyu]
 73: 1492| [45] ["So let's split up and escape separately."]
 74: 1518| [47] [Mashiro]
 75: 1521| [45] ["No! Will you be okay by yourself, Salyu!?"]
 76: 1526| [47] [Salyu]
 77: 1529| [45] ["I will. But there's no time to speak my reasoning."]
 78: 1534| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1537| [45] ["So let's use BC."]
 80: 1542| [45] [Salyu said that, hoping that they would use empathy on her.]
 81: 1547| [45] [She calmed down her mind and thought of the message she wanted to send them.]
 82: 1552| [47] [Salyu]
 83: 1553| [45] [(I've finally found life interesting for once. I don't want it to end like this.)]
 84: 1558| [47] [Salyu]
 85: 1559| [45] [(I truly enjoyed these past six days.)]
 86: 1564| [47] [Salyu]
 87: 1565| [45] [(... These are my true feelings. What I've always wanted to tell you all.)]
 88: 1570| [45] [--Even though Salyu was by no means an eloquent speaker, she was able to express herself honestly if she used pure emotions.]
 89: 1575| [45] [It appeared that they had received her message.]
 90: 1583| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 91: 1586| [45] ["... Okay! Leave these two to me!"]
 92: 1612| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1615| [45] ["Promise me one more thing! That we'll all live long enough to meet again on the outside!"]
 94: 1620| [47] [Salyu]
 95: 1623| [45] ["... Promise."]
 96: 1678| [45] [And on that note, Salyu left.]
 97: 1739| [45] [Blood seeped endlessly from the wound on her upper arm.]
 98: 1744| [47] [Salyu]
 99: 1745| [45] [(My brachial vein's damaged... I need to treat it immediately.)]
100: 1806| [45] [She set a trap along the connecting passageway to prevent the terrorists from chasing after her.]
101: 1862| [45] [And in the area at the end of the passageway, she acquired a security card, a disaster prevention manual, and finally, a stapler.]
102: 1867| [47] [Salyu]
103: 1868| [45] [(I can do temporary first aid with this...)]
104: 1873| [45] [Luckily, the bullet had pierced all the way through.]
105: 1878| [45] [Salyu took the stapler to the gunshot wound in her arm-- and stitched it up.]
106: 1890| [47] [Salyu]
107: 1893| [45] ["--!!"]
108: 1905| [45] [She stifled her voice and treated the exit wound as well--]
109: 1917| [47] [Salyu]
110: 1920| [45] ["Gghh--..."]
111: 1925| [47] [Salyu]
112: 1928| [45] ["Haah, haah..."]
113: 1933| [45] [She sank to the floor, breathing roughly.]
114: 1938| [45] [For now, she had averted a medical emergency.]
115: 1943| [47] [Salyu]
116: 1944| [45] [(.... Now, what do I do from here...?)]
117: 1949| [45] [The terrorist's words echoed in her head.]
118: 2027| [47] [Watase]
119: 2030| [45] ["... Just a word of warning. Get out."]
120: 2038| [47] [Watase]
121: 2041| [45] ["What good is fighting me if it means putting your body in such extreme danger?"]
122: 2099| [45] [--She very well could do what he said and run away.]
123: 2104| [45] [But if the terrorists' goal was to destroy the town in its entirety with a nuclear meltdown, then running away was pretty much pointless.]
124: 2109| [47] [Salyu]
125: 2110| [45] [(... I can't just run away.)]
126: 2115| [47] [Salyu]
127: 2116| [45] [(If we don't prevent the meltdown...)]
128: 2121| [47] [Salyu]
129: 2122| [45] [(If we don't stop them...!)]
130: 2127| [45] [The city would be destroyed.]
131: 2132| [45] [Atomic dust would rain on Natsuhiko, Mashiro, Dr. Tenkawa, and everyone else.]
132: 2137| [45] [There was only one way to stop it.]
133: 2142| [47] [Salyu]
134: 2143| [45] [(... I won't run.)]
135: 2148| [47] [Salyu]
136: 2149| [45] [(What I need to do now is not to run...!)]
137: 2154| [45] [--But to fight.]
138: 2159| [45] [To defeat the terrorists and put an end to their plan.]
139: 2164| [47] [Salyu]
140: 2167| [45] ["Because my role..."]
141: 2172| [47] [Salyu]
142: 2175| [45] ["is to protect Natsuhiko and the others."]
143: 2180| [45] [A faint smile rose to Salyu's lips.]
144: 2191| [45] [With courage welling in her heart, she began to walk once more.]
