  0:   60| [45] [--It was a memory of one day ago--]
  1:   65| [45] [Of when Jun had been sent out on that dispatch right after Natsuhiko and his friends had told her there could be terrorists out there.]
  2:   99| [47] [Operator]
  3:  102| [45] ["An explosion and fire have broken out at the Rokumei City Parapsychology Research Center at 7-2 Nishi-machi."]
  4:  107| [47] [Operator]
  5:  110| [45] ["The report was called in by the Rokumei City Security Department. The cause of the explosion is currently unknown. It's possible an explosive was involved."]
  6:  115| [47] [Operator]
  7:  118| [45] ["Firefighting squads and the elite rescue squad are to hurry to the scene and conduct firefighting and rescue efforts."]
  8:  182| [47] [Jun]
  9:  185| [45] ["Whoa...!"]
 10:  190| [45] [Jun found herself stunned when the PRC finally came into view.]
 11:  195| [45] [The power of that explosion had been no laughing matter.]
 12:  203| [45] [Glass had scattered all over the place, and part of the building had been destroyed.]
 13:  208| [47] [Jun]
 14:  209| [45] [(No gas explosion or anything like that could have done this much damage...!)]
 15:  293| [45] [She recalled the terrorists that Natsuhiko and her friends had told her about just a few minutes ago.]
 16:  311| [45] [Just then, Watase began handing down orders to all of Team A.]
 17:  347| [47] [Watase]
 18:  350| [45] ["We don't know the full situation, so it's too dangerous to go blindly rushing in! Take care of directing the evacuation first!"]
 19:  355| [47] [Jun]
 20:  356| [45] [(Huh!? Directing the evacuation!?)]
 21:  364| [47] [Jun]
 22:  367| [45] ["H... hold on, Captain! What if survivors are still around!?"]
 23:  393| [47] [Watase]
 24:  396| [45] ["No backtalk, rookie! Just follow my orders!"]
 25:  419| [47] [Jun]
 26:  422| [45] ["!!"]
 27:  427| [47] [Jun]
 28:  428| [45] [(The hell's his problem!? Someone needs to get it into his head that he's not a goddamn dictator!)]
 29:  433| [47] [Jun]
 30:  434| [45] [(Our job is to save lives!)]
 31:  439| [47] [Jun]
 32:  440| [45] [(I'm sure the rescue worker who saved me would have always put that first no matter what the dispatch--!)]
 33:  466| [47] [Kazami]
 34:  469| [45] ["Ah, Moribe! Where are you going!?"]
 35:  495| [47] [Watase]
 36:  498| [45] ["Dumbass! Don't go acting on your own!"]
 37:  511| [45] [Jun ignored their calls and ran towards the building.]
 38:  519| [45] [But just as she tried to enter the facility by herself--]
 39:  551| [45] [Something exploded in the building, sending something flying out of it towards Jun.]
 40:  567| [45] [She looked up and realized it was a steel desk bigger than her.]
 41:  572| [47] [Jun]
 42:  573| [45] [(O-oh crap!!)]
 43:  578| [45] [--I can't get away in time!]
 44:  583| [45] [Just as she thought that, a voice called out to her--]
 45:  591| [47] [???]
 46:  594| [45] ["Moribe!"]
 47:  672| [45] [Jun then felt something push her out of the way one second before the desk was due to hit her.]
 48:  677| [45] [When she came to her senses, she realized Watase was on top of her, shielding her with his body.]
 49:  685| [47] [Jun]
 50:  688| [45] ["Ah... C-Captain...?"]
 51:  722| [47] [Watase]
 52:  725| [45] ["Idiot, what did I tell you!?"]
 53:  733| [47] [Jun]
 54:  736| [45] ["I-I'm sorry..."]
 55:  762| [47] [Watase]
 56:  765| [45] ["Well, whatever. Anyway, are you okay!?"]
 57:  773| [47] [Jun]
 58:  776| [45] ["Huh...?"]
 59:  802| [47] [Watase]
 60:  805| [45] ["What's wrong? You're not hurt, are you!?"]
 61:  810| [47] [Jun]
 62:  811| [45] ["..."]
 63:  837| [47] [Watase]
 64:  840| [45] ["... Hey, you gonna keep staring at my face or are you going to say something?"]
 65:  848| [47] [Jun]
 66:  851| [45] ["Sorry, it's just-- I'm a bit surprised you're worried about me, that's all."]
 67:  877| [47] [Watase]
 68:  880| [45] ["Of course I'm worried about you, idiot. As your superior, that's my job."]
 69:  885| [45] [However, she felt a bit awkward hearing that from the Captain, seeing how she didn't get along with him so great.]
 70:  890| [45] [Jun's flustered state of mind was interrupted by Watase rapidly springing to his feet.]
 71:  916| [47] [Watase]
 72:  919| [45] ["Moribe, on your feet! Don't forget we still have a mission to do!"]
 73:  927| [47] [Jun]
 74:  930| [45] ["Y-yes, sir!"]
 75:  943| [45] [Jun quickly took Watase's hand and stood up.]
 76:  948| [45] [When she did, she found herself faced with an unusually stern glare from Watase.]
 77:  956| [47] [Watase]
 78:  959| [45] ["... Listen up, Moribe, and don't forget what I'm about to tell you."]
 79:  967| [47] [Watase]
 80:  970| [45] ["We rescue workers are by no means heroes. We're ordinary people."]
 81:  978| [47] [Watase]
 82:  981| [45] ["If you die, that's it. End of the line."]
 83:  989| [47] [Watase]
 84:  992| [45] ["So you have to prioritize your own survival when you're on the job."]
 85: 1000| [47] [Watase]
 86: 1003| [45] ["The only times we rescue workers can act recklessly is when we're absolutely sure we'll survive."]
 87: 1011| [47] [Watase]
 88: 1014| [45] ["Got it? Make sure you always keep that in mind."]
 89: 1022| [47] [Jun]
 90: 1025| [45] ["Y... yes sir..."]
 91: 1030| [45] [Kazami ran over to them at that moment.]
 92: 1063| [47] [Kazami]
 93: 1066| [45] ["--Captain, Moribe, are you both all right!?"]
 94: 1120| [47] [Watase]
 95: 1123| [45] ["Tachibana, this happened because you were negligent in your supervision duties! Keep a tighter grip on the rookie, got it!?"]
 96: 1149| [47] [Kazami]
 97: 1152| [45] ["Sir, my sincerest apologies, sir!"]
 98: 1178| [47] [Watase]
 99: 1181| [45] ["I'm leaving Moribe in your hands. I'll give orders to Dojima and Hiyama."]
100: 1197| [45] [And with that, Watase quickly dashed off.]
101: 1308| [45] [Jun stared at him with a long gaze.]
102: 1313| [47] [Jun]
103: 1314| [45] [(So in the end, he may be a hardass, but the Captain sure is amazing... I don't even hold a candle to him as I stand now.)]
104: 1319| [45] [But he was a world apart from the image of a hero that Jun had concocted in her mind.]
105: 1324| [45] [To Jun, a "hero" was someone who could do anything they set their heart on even without the skill or experience.]
106: 1329| [47] [Jun]
107: 1330| [45] [(But... in reality, the heart alone can only accomplish so much...)]
108: 1335| [45] [Her failure to realize that fact had almost cost Jun her life just now.]
109: 1340| [47] [Jun]
110: 1341| [45] [(Tch... I've still got a long way to go. The captain's right to call me a rookie.)]
111: 1346| [47] [Jun]
112: 1347| [45] [(Then I've got to learn as much as I can from him so I can stand on my own as soon as possible!)]
113: 1454| [47] [Kazami]
114: 1457| [45] ["--Moribe, we need to get going too."]
115: 1465| [47] [Jun]
116: 1468| [45] ["Yes!"]
117: 1474| [45] [Jun nodded, then chased after Watase with Kazami.]
