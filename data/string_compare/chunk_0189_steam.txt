  1:   71| [45] [--For now, they took the bus and got off in front of the Parapsychology Research Center.]
  2:  171| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:  174| [45] ["Is this place being targeted...?"]
  4:  179| [45] [In spite of their misgivings, the area was quite peaceful.]
  5:  184| [45] [Mashiro stepped up to the building and tried to go inside, but--]
  6:  210| [47] [Mashiro]
  7:  213| [45] ["Huh...? It's locked."]
  8:  239| [47] [Salyu]
  9:  242| [45] ["Is it normally open?"]
 10:  268| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  271| [45] ["I think so... Should we check another day?"]
 12:  279| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  282| [45] ["No, we came all this way. So let's go look for a staff member or someone."]
 14:  290| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 15:  293| [45] ["It's such a huge research facility, so I'm sure there's at least someone around."]
 16:  319| [47] [Mashiro]
 17:  322| [45] ["I want to hear their story at least. It would actually be a relief if they did get objectionable literature too."]
 18:  398| [45] [They walked around the building's circumference as they spoke.]
 19:  409| [45] [Perimeter security was sparse; there was not a single guard to be seen.]
 20:  414| [45] [Furthermore, the building's back entrance--]
 21:  457| [47] [Salyu]
 22:  460| [45] ["Ah... this door isn't locked."]
 23:  468| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  471| [45] ["Huh?"]
 25:  476| [45] [Just as Salyu said, the rear entrance was unlocked.]
 26:  484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 27:  487| [45] ["Security's way too sloppy here... Isn't that a little worrying?"]
 28:  513| [47] [Mashiro]
 29:  516| [45] ["Wait, it could be the tracks a terrorist left after breaking in...!"]
 30:  524| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  527| [45] ["!!"]
 32:  553| [47] [Mashiro]
 33:  556| [45] ["W-what do we do!? Should we report it to the police?"]
 34:  564| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 35:  567| [45] ["No, that would probably be too hasty... They'd probably just laugh it off, anyway."]
 36:  572| [45] [Mashiro considered Natsuhiko's statement for a second before continuing.]
 37:  598| [47] [Mashiro]
 38:  601| [45] ["Then... how about we go inside for a bit and check?"]
 39:  609| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  612| [45] ["Would that be okay?"]
 41:  638| [47] [Salyu]
 42:  641| [45] ["I wouldn't recommend it. But if anything happens, I'll protect you two."]
 43:  667| [47] [Mashiro]
 44:  670| [45] ["Ooh... you're such a lovable girl, you."]
 45:  675| [45] [Salyu said that word again.]
 46:  683| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 47:  686| [45] ["'Protect' us, huh... I appreciate the thought, but you shouldn't do something so dangerous."]
 48:  691| [45] [There was no way he could expect such a small girl to protect him.]
 49:  696| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 50:  697| [45] [(If anything happens, I should be the one to protect Salyu and not the other way around.)]
 51:  702| [45] [And with that thought, Natsuhiko trespassed into the building from the back entrance alongside the girls.]
 52:  809| [45] [As they passed through the corridor, they quickly came upon a wide room.]
 53:  873| [45] [It was the same office-like space they had visited during the field trip.]
 54:  878| [45] [The room was quiet. Or rather--]
 55:  904| [47] [Salyu]
 56:  907| [45] ["Too quiet..."]
 57:  915| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 58:  918| [45] ["Yeah, it's like there's nobody here."]
 59:  987| [47] [Mashiro]
 60:  990| [45] ["Do you think the whole facility is taking today off?"]
 61:  995| [45] [Something seemed odd about that suggestion.]
 62: 1000| [45] [This was a facility that published many research results year round.]
 63: 1008| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 64: 1011| [45] ["There has to be at least someone around. Let's just look a little."]
 65: 1037| [47] [Mashiro]
 66: 1040| [45] ["Y-yeah."]
 67: 1045| [45] [The three of them nervously walked around the facility.]
 68: 1148| [45] [--However--]
 69: 1153| [45] [No matter how much they searched, they found neither hide nor hair of a single person.]
 70: 1211| [45] [For the time being, they returned to the first room and spoke amongst themselves.]
 71: 1219| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 72: 1222| [45] ["What...? Seriously? Nobody came at all?"]
 73: 1248| [47] [Mashiro]
 74: 1251| [45] ["Yeah, kinda strange, isn't it...?"]
 75: 1256| [45] [Salyu nodded and muttered softly.]
 76: 1325| [47] [Salyu]
 77: 1328| [45] ["That's not all that's strange."]
 78: 1336| [47] [Salyu]
 79: 1339| [45] ["This facility supposedly conducts various sorts of research, but there's a striking lack of research equipment."]
 80: 1347| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 81: 1350| [45] ["Huh?"]
 82: 1376| [47] [Mashiro]
 83: 1379| [45] ["Ah... you're right."]
 84: 1384| [45] [She did make a good point.]
 85: 1389| [45] [There were several office-like rooms, but there were next to no actual experimental devices to be seen.]
 86: 1397| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 87: 1400| [45] ["Now that you mention it, I got the impression that a lot of the rooms were empty or for storage..."]
 88: 1426| [47] [Mashiro]
 89: 1429| [45] ["Several rooms were locked. So maybe those were the experimental rooms?"]
 90: 1455| [47] [Salyu]
 91: 1458| [45] ["No, judging by the circumstances--"]
 92: 1463| [45] [Just as Salyu said that,]
 93: 1574| [45] [they suddenly heard a noise from outside the room.]
