  0:   10| [55] [âˆšDouble Chapter 6]
  1:   21| [45] [And so-- Natsuhiko came to his decision.]
  2:   26| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  3:   27| [45] [(I'll stay...)]
  4:   32| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:   33| [45] [(I'll stay with Watase and Mr. Ukita...!)]
  6:   38| [45] [He could understand their determination, and it didn't seem like anyone could convince them otherwise anyway.]
  7:  131| [45] [So Natsuhiko sent telepathy to Watase.]
  8:  136| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  139| [45] [{Watase... don't say anything, just listen.}]
 10:  165| [47] [Watase]
 11:  168| [45] ["!?"]
 12:  176| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 13:  179| [45] [{I'll stay down here too. Let's allow the girls to escape.}]
 14:  240| [47] [Watase]
 15:  243| [45] ["..."]
 16:  273| [45] [Watase glanced at Natsuhiko.]
 17:  278| [45] [As if to ask "You okay with that?"]
 18:  283| [45] [Natsuhiko gritted his teeth.]
 19:  288| [45] [... Of course he wasn't okay with that.]
 20:  293| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 21:  294| [45] [(I don't want to do it either...!)]
 22:  299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 23:  300| [45] [(Of course I don't want to die...!)]
 24:  368| [45] [But Natsuhiko had made a promise.]
 25:  373| [45] [To get Yuuri out of there no matter what.]
 26:  455| [45] [He made a vow to himself:]
 27:  460| [45] [That no matter what happened from here on out, he'd protect Mashiro and Salyu.]
 28:  477| [45] [--He didn't want to go back on his word.]
 29:  482| [45] [Natsuhiko had been protected by everyone else this entire time--]
 30:  487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 31:  488| [45] [(So this is the least I can do to repay that debt...)]
 32:  493| [45] [With that thought, Natsuhiko smiled back at Watase.]
 33:  548| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  551| [45] [{... It's okay. There's no other way.}]
 35:  559| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 36:  562| [45] [{The problem is that even if I say I'm going to stay behind, Yuuri and the others won't accept it--}]
 37:  570| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 38:  573| [45] [{So we have to take emergency measures. Please knock out Yuuri, Mashiro, and Salyu for me.}]
 39:  581| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 40:  584| [45] [{And then somehow persuade Ms. Tachibana and the others to carry them outside.}]
 41:  678| [47] [Watase]
 42:  681| [45] ["...!"]
 43:  704| [45] [Watase fell silent and said nothing.]
 44:  727| [45] [But eventually, he nodded resolutely.]
 45:  735| [47] [Watase]
 46:  738| [45] ["... Got it."]
 47:  824| [45] [When he heard that whisper, Natsuhiko sent the same sort of telepathy to Ukita.]
 48:  850| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 49:  853| [45] [{Mr. Ukita, I'll stay down here too.}]
 50:  914| [47] [Ukita]
 51:  917| [45] ["Wha..."]
 52:  925| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53:  928| [45] [{Watase's going to knock out Yuuri, Mashiro, and Salyu. And then he'll get Ms. Tachibana to carry them.}]
 54:  969| [47] [Ukita]
 55:  972| [45] ["B-but then you--"]
 56: 1005| [45] [And then, as if triggered by Ukita's voice,]
 57: 1103| [45] [Watase jumped at Salyu.]
 58: 1144| [47] [Salyu]
 59: 1147| [45] ["!?"]
 60: 1152| [45] [Salyu's body stiffened for a second.]
 61: 1190| [45] [But before she could ready herself, Watase hit her in the neck with a knifehand strike.]
 62: 1251| [47] [Salyu]
 63: 1254| [45] ["Ghh!"]
 64: 1266| [45] [Salyu groaned and fell on the spot.]
 65: 1274| [47] [Kazami]
 66: 1277| [45] ["Wha-!?"]
 67: 1285| [47] [Jun]
 68: 1288| [45] ["What are you doing, Captain!?"]
 69: 1293| [45] [Kazami and Jun shouted in shock.]
 70: 1342| [45] [But without stopping, Watase wrapped behind Mashiro and squeezed her neck.]
 71: 1415| [47] [Mashiro]
 72: 1418| [45] ["...!"]
 73: 1456| [45] [She fell unconscious all too easily.]
 74: 1490| [45] [Everyone stared in wide-eyed surprise at Watase's abrupt actions.]
 75: 1523| [47] [Ena]
 76: 1526| [45] ["C-Captain Kasasagi!? Don't tell me the malice relapsed--!?"]
 77: 1531| [45] [Ena covered Yuuri in confusion.]
 78: 1672| [45] [Yuuri looked at Natsuhiko and shouted.]
 79: 1705| [47] [Yuuri]
 80: 1708| [45] ["Hikorin, that means we'll have to go back one more time and--!"]
 81: 1713| [45] [When he heard those words--]
 82: 1771| [45] [Natsuhiko shook his head and used telepathy.]
 83: 1779| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 84: 1782| [45] [{Yuuri, Watase hasn't gone mad... I told him to do this.}]
 85: 1806| [47] [Yuuri]
 86: 1809| [45] [{Huh!?}]
 87: 1817| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 88: 1820| [45] [{We've come to our decision.}]
 89: 1828| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 90: 1831| [45] [{Watase, Mr. Ukita, and I will be the ones to stay down here.}]
 91: 1839| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 92: 1842| [45] [{We'll have Ms. Tachibana carry Salyu and Mashiro...}]
 93: 1866| [47] [Yuuri]
 94: 1869| [45] [{No... no!}]
 95: 1893| [47] [Yuuri]
 96: 1896| [45] [{Don't do it, Hikorin! We can't let ourselves get separated after all we've been through to get back together--!}]
 97: 1901| [45] [Yuuri's telepathy...]
 98: 1906| [45] [... was filled with her emotions.]
 99: 1911| [45] [Her grief. Her concern. And her desperation.]
100: 1916| [45] [Natsuhiko smiled and gave his answer.]
101: 1924| [47] [Natsuhiko]
102: 1927| [45] [{... Sorry, Yuuri.}]
103: 1935| [47] [Natsuhiko]
104: 1938| [45] [{Thank you so much for everything you've done.}]
105: 1946| [47] [Natsuhiko]
106: 1949| [45] [{Send my regards to Mashiro, Salyu, and Mom for me.}]
107: 1991| [47] [Yuuri]
108: 1994| [45] [{Hikorin! No, no, no, no! Stop!}]
109: 1999| [45] [But in spite of Yuuri's desperate telepathy--]
110: 2004| [45] [Natsuhiko used Senses Sympathy on her.]
111: 2063| [47] [Yuuri]
112: 2066| [45] [{!!}]
113: 2214| [45] [And he blew away her memory of the "present".]
114: 2219| [45] [In the same way he once did to knock out Watase.]
115: 2227| [47] [Yuuri]
116: 2230| [45] [{Hiko... rin...!}]
117: 2235| [45] [And with that final thought--]
118: 2240| [45] [Yuuri fainted.]
119: 2298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
120: 2299| [45] ["..."]
121: 2305| [45] [When Natsuhiko returned to reality, he saw Yuuri slowly falling to the floor.]
122: 2341| [45] [Ena gasped and caught her.]
123: 2387| [45] [Watase used that opportunity to take his gun out of his pocket--]
124: 2398| [45] [And pointed it at Kazami and the others.]
125: 2409| [47] [Kazami]
126: 2412| [45] ["... What is the meaning of this, Captain?"]
127: 2417| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase.]
128: 2422| [45] [Watase looked her back in the eye and answered.]
129: 2440| [47] [Watase]
130: 2443| [45] ["There's no time to argue, so we had to take extreme measures--"]
131: 2451| [47] [Watase]
132: 2454| [45] ["But we've come to our decision."]
133: 2462| [47] [Watase]
134: 2465| [45] ["Natsuhiko, the old man, and I will stay down here."]
135: 2473| [47] [Jun]
136: 2476| [45] ["Wha... Don't just decide things on your own like that!"]
137: 2484| [47] [Ena]
138: 2487| [45] ["That's right, I can't let a student of mine get caught up in--"]
139: 2495| [47] [Watase]
140: 2498| [45] ["I just said there's no time to argue!"]
141: 2503| [47] [Jun & Ena]
142: 2506| [45] ["!"]
143: 2511| [45] [Ena and the others trembled at Watase's angry shout.]
144: 2519| [47] [Watase]
145: 2522| [45] ["... We'll stay in the control room and open the bulkheads."]
146: 2530| [47] [Watase]
147: 2533| [45] ["Kazami, Moribe, Teach, you guys take Yuuri and the others outside."]
148: 2538| [45] [Watase spoke with a stern voice.]
149: 2553| [45] [But Kazami couldn't keep quiet.]
150: 2561| [47] [Kazami]
151: 2564| [45] ["You think you can stop me with that thing?"]
152: 2572| [47] [Kazami]
153: 2575| [45] ["Are you going to shoot me?"]
154: 2593| [47] [Watase]
155: 2596| [45] ["I will."]
156: 2604| [47] [Watase]
157: 2607| [45] ["I'm no longer a rescue worker, see."]
158: 2612| [45] [Kazami's expression warped at those words.]
159: 2620| [47] [Kazami]
160: 2623| [45] ["... Watase!"]
161: 2629| [45] [Right when she tried to rush over at him--]
162: 2764| [45] [Watase pulled the trigger.]
163: 2772| [47] [Kazami]
164: 2775| [45] ["..."]
165: 2780| [45] [The bullet landed by her feet. Kazami stopped.]
166: 2785| [45] [Watase continued.]
167: 2793| [47] [Watase]
168: 2796| [45] ["... Understand? I have no qualms pulling the trigger on this life-stealing tool."]
169: 2804| [47] [Watase]
170: 2807| [45] ["I've long lost the right to be called your squadmate."]
171: 2812| [47] [Kazami]
172: 2813| [45] ["..."]
173: 2821| [47] [Watase]
174: 2824| [45] ["But still... let me give one last order."]
175: 2832| [47] [Watase]
176: 2835| [45] ["Tachibana. Moribe. Rescue these three survivors and get them out of here."]
177: 2843| [47] [Watase]
178: 2846| [45] ["You two are rescue workers. It's your mission to save lives."]
179: 2854| [47] [Jun]
180: 2857| [45] ["Captain..."]
181: 2862| [45] [Jun spoke tearfully.]
182: 2867| [45] [Eventually, Kazami nodded bitterly.]
183: 2875| [47] [Kazami]
184: 2878| [45] ["... Understood."]
185: 2886| [47] [Kazami]
186: 2889| [45] ["We'll carry out our mission...!"]
187: 2897| [47] [Watase]
188: 2900| [45] ["... Thank you, Kazami."]
189: 2905| [45] [As Watase squeezed out his voice, his face warped in bitter pain.]
190: 2963| [45] [He lowered his gun and addressed everyone.]
191: 2971| [47] [Watase]
192: 2974| [45] ["Now then, Kazami, Moribe, Teach..."]
193: 2982| [47] [Watase]
194: 2985| [45] ["We'll open the bulkheads in exactly three minutes. Get out of here immediately."]
195: 3018| [47] [Kazami]
196: 3021| [45] ["Roger..."]
197: 3035| [45] [Kazami muttered and then shouldered Yuuri.]
198: 3040| [45] [Jun took Mashiro and Ena took Salyu.]
199: 3045| [45] [Before they left the control room, the three turned around and spoke.]
200: 3104| [47] [Kazami]
201: 3107| [45] ["... Let's meet again outside for sure."]
202: 3133| [47] [Jun]
203: 3136| [45] ["Captain, Natsuhiko, Mr. Ukita... Don't die on us, okay?"]
204: 3162| [47] [Ena]
205: 3165| [45] ["I'll never forgive you if any of you three die!"]
206: 3183| [45] [And with those words, the women left the room.]
207: 3188| [45] [The men left behind sighed heavily.]
208: 3215| [47] [Watase]
209: 3218| [45] ["Don't die, huh... Now that's a tall order."]
210: 3226| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3229| [45] ["Well, if they didn't believe in the possibility that we'd survive, I don't think we could've gotten them out of here."]
212: 3256| [47] [Ukita]
213: 3259| [45] ["Indeed..."]
214: 3285| [47] [Watase]
215: 3288| [45] ["Well, whatever. Let's focus on what we need to do first."]
216: 3293| [45] [Natsuhiko and Ukita nodded at Watase's words.]
217: 3379| [45] [They then stood in front of Brain Cell's control terminals.]
218: 3384| [45] [They watched the clock and waited for the time to open the bulkheads--]
219: 3453| [47] [Watase]
220: 3456| [45] ["... Okay, now! Open the bulkheads!"]
221: 3464| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3467| [45] ["Yeah!"]
223: 3538| [45] [At Watase's signal, they operated Brain Cell.]
224: 3549| [45] [They stole root authority, canceled the Case N declaration, and opened the bulkheads.]
225: 3554| [45] [They had no means of checking if Yuuri and the others had escaped, but--]
226: 3597| [47] [Ukita]
227: 3600| [45] ["Mmm, they're probably safe..."]
228: 3608| [47] [Ukita]
229: 3611| [45] ["I'm sure they were all able to escape."]
230: 3616| [45] [Natsuhiko and the others believed in that.]
231: 3624| [47] [Natsuhiko]
232: 3627| [45] ["... So at the very least, the girls are safe."]
233: 3653| [47] [Watase]
234: 3656| [45] ["Yeah. We've fulfilled our minimum duty."]
235: 3682| [47] [Ukita]
236: 3685| [45] ["Takes some of the load off my shoulders when I think about it like that."]
237: 3690| [45] [They laughed faintly.]
238: 3695| [45] [Their facial expressions were blurred with resignation.]
239: 3700| [47] [Natsuhiko]
240: 3701| [45] [(We just wait for the explosion now, huh...)]
241: 3706| [45] [Naturally, their chances of survival looked hopeless.]
242: 3711| [45] [That was for sure, no matter what Kazami and the others said.]
243: 3719| [47] [Natsuhiko]
244: 3722| [45] ["... Watase, what time is it?"]
245: 3750| [47] [Watase]
246: 3753| [45] ["Hmm? It's 6:06."]
247: 3761| [47] [Natsuhiko]
248: 3764| [45] ["... Only ten minutes until detonation, huh...?"]
249: 3769| [45] [The moment he muttered that--]
250: 3874| [45] [Natsuhiko was struck by an intense fear.]
251: 3879| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 3880| [45] [(In ten minutes, I'll be erased from this world...!)]
253: 3885| [47] [Natsuhiko]
254: 3886| [45] [(I'll be blown to bits before I can feel any pain, buried deep beneath this pitch black earth...!)]
255: 3891| [45] [He could no longer escape to the outside world.]
256: 3966| [45] [He would never see Yuuri, Mashiro, Salyu, or his mother again.]
257: 4081| [45] [Once the realization of that truth crushed his mind--]
258: 4086| [45] [Watase and Ukita spoke up.]
259: 4154| [47] [Watase]
260: 4157| [45] ["--Now then, guess we should look for a way to survive."]
261: 4183| [47] [Ukita]
262: 4186| [45] ["Indeed."]
263: 4194| [47] [Natsuhiko]
264: 4197| [45] ["... Huh?"]
265: 4208| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't believe what he saw.]
266: 4213| [45] [But they kept speaking as if it were only natural.]
267: 4239| [47] [Watase]
268: 4242| [45] ["To survive, we should secure a place in this facility that the explosions can't reach."]
269: 4250| [47] [Watase]
270: 4253| [45] ["And explosions basically spread up and out."]
271: 4279| [47] [Ukita]
272: 4282| [45] ["Right, so the explosion will rise from Area Zero to Area N, so--"]
273: 4308| [47] [Watase]
274: 4311| [45] ["Let's keep all the Area N gates closed except for the one leading to Area 2. That way, the explosion will head towards Area 2 first."]
275: 4319| [47] [Watase]
276: 4322| [45] ["Which would make Area 5 on the opposite end relatively safer."]
277: 4348| [47] [Ukita]
278: 4351| [45] ["Indeed. Furthermore, the shelter's protective walls should increase any likelihood of survival."]
279: 4377| [47] [Watase]
280: 4380| [45] ["Right, so let's get to work on the double and--"]
281: 4388| [47] [Natsuhiko]
282: 4391| [45] ["Wh-what are you talking about...!?"]
283: 4396| [45] [Natsuhiko could no longer keep himself from interrupting their discussion.]
284: 4404| [47] [Natsuhiko]
285: 4407| [45] ["The tetryl bomb's powerful enough to blow all of LABO away in its entirety, isn't it!?"]
286: 4415| [47] [Natsuhiko]
287: 4418| [45] ["Do you seriously think that little trick can guarantee survival!?"]
288: 4444| [47] [Watase]
289: 4447| [45] ["I don't want to sit back and do nothing."]
290: 4473| [47] [Watase]
291: 4476| [45] ["And besides... it'll increase your chances of survival, won't it?"]
292: 4484| [47] [Natsuhiko]
293: 4487| [45] ["What!?"]
294: 4513| [47] [Ukita]
295: 4516| [45] ["That's right. Natsuhiko, we need to get you to as safe a place as possible."]
296: 4542| [47] [Ukita]
297: 4545| [45] ["And the shelter is indeed probably the best place there is."]
298: 4571| [47] [Watase]
299: 4574| [45] ["It's in the next area. Can you move there on your own?"]
300: 4582| [47] [Natsuhiko]
301: 4585| [45] ["On my own...!?"]
302: 4593| [47] [Natsuhiko]
303: 4596| [45] ["Wh-what about you...!?"]
304: 4622| [47] [Watase]
305: 4625| [45] ["... What are you, stupid? Don't you know?"]
306: 4630| [45] [Watase spoke with a wry smile on his face.]
307: 4656| [47] [Watase]
308: 4659| [45] ["To let the explosion loose towards Area 2, we need to open the security gate..."]
309: 4667| [47] [Watase]
310: 4670| [45] ["Which means the two of us can't go to the shelter."]
311: 4678| [47] [Watase]
312: 4681| [45] ["Those security gates close automatically after a while, remember?"]
313: 4707| [47] [Watase]
314: 4710| [45] ["So to open the gates for the connecting passageway from Area N to Area 2--"]
315: 4718| [47] [Watase]
316: 4721| [45] ["We have to open the gates ourselves in time with the explosion."]
317: 4744| [47] [Natsuhiko]
318: 4747| [45] ["!!"]
319: 4752| [45] [Natsuhiko gasped at those words.]
320: 4757| [45] [But Ukita calmly nodded in complete understanding.]
321: 4783| [47] [Ukita]
322: 4786| [45] ["The connecting passageway has two security gates. So that's one for each of us. Perfect."]
323: 4794| [47] [Natsuhiko]
324: 4797| [45] ["You can't be serious...!"]
325: 4823| [47] [Watase]
326: 4826| [45] ["Understand? Then hurry up and go."]
327: 4852| [47] [Ukita]
328: 4855| [45] ["I'm sorry, but there really is no time to argue anymore."]
329: 4860| [45] [Watase and Ukita smiled.]
330: 4865| [45] [As if they had known from the start that it'd end like this and that Natsuhiko would react that way.]
331: 4887| [47] [Natsuhiko]
332: 4890| [45] ["Watase... Mr. Ukita...!"]
333: 4895| [45] [Natsuhiko's voice quivered as he muttered their names.]
334: 4900| [45] [Watase looked at him and spoke with a wry smirk.]
335: 4926| [47] [Watase]
336: 4929| [45] ["... You're such an idiot, Natsuhiko. What are you crying for?"]
337: 4937| [47] [Watase]
338: 4940| [45] ["There's not a single reason you should be crying for us, is there?"]
339: 4966| [47] [Ukita]
340: 4969| [45] ["Exactly... We're terrorists. You're a victim. No matter what sort of abuse we take, there's no sense in crying over it for us."]
341: 4977| [47] [Natsuhiko]
342: 4980| [45] ["But...!"]
343: 4985| [45] [Natsuhiko stopped. He said no more.]
344: 4990| [45] [Eventually, Watase looked at him and muttered.]
345: 5016| [47] [Watase]
346: 5019| [45] ["... Now go, Natskuhiko. Time's almost up."]
347: 5045| [47] [Ukita]
348: 5048| [45] ["Hurry. If you don't reach the shelter, then it will all have been for nothing."]
349: 5053| [45] [At those words, Natsuhiko cast his head down--]
350: 5061| [47] [Natsuhiko]
351: 5064| [45] ["... Goodbye, you guys."]
352: 5102| [45] [And with that answer, he rushed out of the control room.]
353: 5210| [45] [As he made his way to the Area 5 shelter--]
354: 5223| [45] [--tears formed in Natsuhiko's eyes.]
355: 5231| [47] [Natsuhiko]
356: 5234| [45] ["Dammit... goddammit...!"]
357: 5239| [45] [He once thought of them as enemies he had to defeat.]
358: 5244| [45] [But the tears wouldn't end, no matter how much he wiped them.]
359: 5295| [45] [--There was no guarantee that Natsuhiko would survive, even with Watase's and Ukita's fatal wager.]
360: 5300| [45] [So there was no reason for them to make that wager in the first place.]
361: 5305| [45] [But perhaps that was their way to atone.]
362: 5310| [47] [Natsuhiko]
363: 5311| [45] [(But still...!)]
364: 5316| [47] [Natsuhiko]
365: 5317| [45] [(Still, that's just...!)]
366: 5322| [45] [His entire body ached from the wounds Watase had inflicted on him.]
367: 5327| [45] [But what hurt the most was his heart.]
368: 5393| [45] [--Natsuhiko arrived at the shelter.]
369: 5406| [45] [He sat on the ground and thought to himself.]
370: 5487| [47] [Natsuhiko]
371: 5488| [45] [(Tell me, Watase... We were supposed to be partners whose lives were in the same boat, weren't we?)]
372: 5493| [47] [Natsuhiko]
373: 5494| [45] [(So why do I have to survive when you have to die...?)]
374: 5499| [47] [Natsuhiko]
375: 5500| [45] [(We promised that everyone would get out alive, together... That included both you and Mr. Ukita too...!)]
376: 5505| [45] [But this was Watase's final wish.]
377: 5510| [45] [So as his partner, Natsuhiko wanted to respect his will.]
378: 5615| [45] [With that thought in mind, Natsuhiko covered his face with his hands, and--]
379: 5621| [45] [When he saw that--]
380: 5629| [47] [Natsuhiko]
381: 5632| [45] ["... Fine, I get it! I'll go!"]
382: 5637| [45] [Natsuhiko declared that to Watase and Ukita.]
383: 5645| [47] [Natsuhiko]
384: 5648| [45] ["But just so you know, you're not getting any of my gratitude, okay!?"]
385: 5656| [47] [Natsuhiko]
386: 5659| [45] ["At best, all you're doing is taking responsibility for what you've done!"]
387: 5685| [47] [Watase]
388: 5688| [45] ["Haah... so you berate me to the very end, huh?"]
389: 5714| [47] [Ukita]
390: 5717| [45] ["Well, what's wrong with that? He's got every right to berate us with whatever abusive language he wants."]
391: 5722| [45] [The two of them completely turned aside Natsuhiko's words.]
392: 5727| [45] [Natsuhiko really had nothing more he could say.]
393: 5732| [45] [Eventually, Watase looked at him and muttered.]
394: 5758| [47] [Watase]
395: 5761| [45] ["... So long, Communicator."]
396: 5766| [45] [At those words, Natsuhiko cast his head down--]
397: 5774| [47] [Natsuhiko]
398: 5777| [45] ["... So long, terrorists."]
399: 5782| [45] [And with that answer, he rushed out of the control room.]
400: 5890| [45] [As he made his way to the Area 5 shelter--]
401: 5903| [45] [--tears formed in Natsuhiko's eyes.]
402: 5911| [47] [Natsuhiko]
403: 5914| [45] ["Dammit, why...!"]
404: 5919| [45] [He thought he wouldn't have a single tear to shed for Watase and Ukita.]
405: 5924| [45] [But the tears wouldn't end, no matter how much he wiped them.]
406: 5929| [45] [--There was no guarantee that Natsuhiko would survive, even with Watase's and Ukita's fatal wager.]
407: 5934| [45] [So there was no reason for them to make that wager in the first place.]
408: 5939| [45] [But perhaps that was their way to atone.]
409: 5990| [47] [Natsuhiko]
410: 5991| [45] [(But still...!)]
411: 5996| [47] [Natsuhiko]
412: 5997| [45] [(Still, that's just...!)]
413: 6002| [45] [His entire body ached from the wounds Watase had inflicted on him.]
414: 6007| [45] [But what hurt the most was his heart.]
415: 6073| [45] [--Natsuhiko arrived at the shelter.]
416: 6086| [45] [He sat on the ground and thought to himself.]
417: 6167| [47] [Natsuhiko]
418: 6168| [45] [(At the very last moment, we ended up with another confrontation...)]
419: 6173| [45] [But regardless, he felt he had come to understand Watase just a little.]
420: 6178| [45] [That realization made Natsuhiko incredibly irritated and unbearably sad.]
421: 6183| [47] [Natsuhiko]
422: 6184| [45] [(... It's too late to do anything, and it's not like I'm happy about it or anything...)]
423: 6189| [47] [Natsuhiko]
424: 6190| [45] [(But still, to the very end...)]
425: 6195| [47] [Natsuhiko]
426: 6196| [45] [(He was my partner.)]
427: 6301| [45] [Then, just as a smile formed on Natsuhiko's lips--]
428: 6328| [45] [he heard a thunderous roar off in the distance.]
429: 6363| [45] [Roars and tremors approached through the floor.]
430: 6368| [45] [He could feel an intense force and extreme heat rushing through the facility.]
431: 6373| [45] [From Area 2, to Area 3, and through Area 4--]
432: 6378| [45] [All the way to Area 5, where Natsuhiko was.]
433: 6383| [47] [Natsuhiko]
434: 6384| [45] ["..."]
435: 6389| [45] [Natsuhiko yielded himself to the thunderous roar--]
436: 6405| [45] [And softly shut his eyes.]
437: 6637| [85] [ã€€%Nã€€%N]
438: 6640| [45] [âˆšD Normal Ending #2 [Salvation from the Root]]
439: 6643| [85] [ã€€]
440: 6646| [45] [The result of the three at fault remaining in LABO.]
441: 6649| [85] [ã€€]
442: 6652| [45] [You may be able to avert this fate by making a decision that ties to another possibility at the SSS input just before this ending.]
443: 6655| [85] [ã€€]
444: 6658| [45] [Otherwise, by looking into Ukita's, Jun's, Ena's, and Salyu's memories in more depth with the RAM System, the information energy in LABO can be raised to extremely high concentrations.]
445: 6661| [45] [Doing so can perhaps unlock even more fates.]
