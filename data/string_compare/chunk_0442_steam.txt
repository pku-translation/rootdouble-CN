  0:   95| [45] [--In the short time after Natsuhiko had called for Kazami through the PA, but before she arrived--]
  1:  100| [45] [Mashiro looked at Natsuhiko and Yuuri and secretly thought to herself.]
  2:  105| [47] [Mashiro]
  3:  106| [45] [(... I'm such a bad girl...)]
  4:  141| [45] [Her best friend whom she hadn't seen in nine years was right in front of her,]
  5:  216| [45] [almost snuggling up next to Natsuhiko.]
  6:  221| [45] [Mashiro sighed softly enough that nobody would notice.]
  7:  226| [47] [Mashiro]
  8:  227| [45] [(I've got such a pitch black mind... I'm the complete opposite of my name...)]
  9:  232| [45] [The name "Mashiro" was given to her by her mother who had wanted to raise a girl as pure as the color white.]
 10:  237| [45] [But Mashiro was now tormented by the feelings her mother had placed into her name.]
 11:  242| [45] [--Mashiro was surprised from the bottom of her heart to have learned that Yuuri was alive.]
 12:  247| [45] [Her surprise soon turned into happiness.]
 13:  252| [45] [But even so, for a split second, she had another thought:]
 14:  257| [45] ["If Yuuri's alive, then I don't have a chance... She's going to take Natsuhiko away."]
 15:  337| [45] [--She had that thought even though Yuuri was a precious friend to her.]
 16:  342| [45] [Even though Yuuri had gone to LABO instead of her, and wasted nine years of her life.]
 17:  347| [47] [Mashiro]
 18:  348| [45] [(I'm the worst...!)]
 19:  353| [47] [Mashiro]
 20:  354| [45] [(People's lives and livelihoods are at stake here, and I have the audacity to think about love...?)]
 21:  359| [45] [Even if it was for just a second, she really could not forgive herself for feeling bitter about her best friend's survival.]
 22:  427| [45] [And now that she had learned of Yuuri's devotion and love, she couldn't just ignore it.]
 23:  432| [45] [There was no possible way for her to ignore Yuuri's feelings and enjoy her own romance with Natsuhiko.]
 24:  437| [47] [Mashiro]
 25:  438| [45] [(... I guess I really should back out, then.)]
 26:  443| [47] [Mashiro]
 27:  444| [45] [(I'll watch over the two of them like I always have...)]
 28:  449| [45] [Once Mashiro had that thought, Yuuri glanced her way.]
 29:  472| [47] [Mashiro]
 30:  475| [45] ["!"]
 31:  501| [47] [Yuuri]
 32:  504| [45] ["...? What's wrong, Mashiron?"]
 33:  509| [47] [Mashiro]
 34:  512| [45] ["N-no, it's nothing."]
 35:  517| [47] [Mashiro]
 36:  520| [45] ["I was just thinking that Ms. Tachibana's really taking her time getting here, huh?"]
 37:  555| [45] [She tried to smooth things over and look away.]
 38:  560| [45] [But she still felt Yuuri's gaze upon her.]
 39:  565| [47] [Mashiro]
 40:  566| [45] [(Please don't look, Yuuri...)]
 41:  571| [47] [Mashiro]
 42:  572| [45] [(You're the last person I can reveal these feelings to...!)]
 43:  577| [45] [With that thought in mind, she tried to close her heart, but then--]
 44:  582| [45] [Yuuri's voice echoed in her head.]
 45:  639| [85] [{M-Mashiron... could it be...}]
 46:  640| [86] [Yuuri]
 47:  641| [86] [{M-Mashiron... could it be...}]
 48:  656| [85] [{That you thought I was going to take Hikorin away from you...?}]
 49:  657| [86] [Yuuri]
 50:  658| [86] [{That you thought I was going to take Hikorin away from you...?}]
 51:  701| [47] [Mashiro]
 52:  702| [45] [(!?)]
 53:  707| [45] [Mashiro gasped and asked back with telepathy.]
 54:  732| [47] [Mashiro]
 55:  735| [45] [{Yuuri, no way... You read my mind?}]
 56:  740| [47] [Yuuri]
 57:  743| [45] [{... No, I didn't.}]
 58:  748| [47] [Yuuri]
 59:  751| [45] [{I just thought that if I were you, I'd be feeling the same thing...}]
 60:  756| [47] [Yuuri]
 61:  759| [45] [{I was thinking I'd back out too.}]
 62:  764| [47] [Mashiro]
 63:  767| [45] [{Huh...?}]
 64:  772| [45] [Noticing the sorrow in Yuuri's expression, Mashiro bit her lip.]
 65:  777| [45] [Yuuri looked at Mashiro and continued.]
 66:  800| [47] [Yuuri]
 67:  803| [45] [{But Mashiron... that's not good for either of us.}]
 68:  808| [47] [Yuuri]
 69:  811| [45] [{We can't keep on thinking that it's okay to make sacrifices for the sake of others.}]
 70:  816| [47] [Mashiro]
 71:  819| [45] [{Wh-why?}]
 72:  824| [47] [Mashiro]
 73:  827| [45] [{You've sacrificed your life for Natsuhiko, haven't you?}]
 74:  850| [47] [Yuuri]
 75:  853| [45] [{That's exactly why.}]
 76:  858| [47] [Yuuri]
 77:  861| [45] [{Mashiron, you see, I've lived my life thinking it would be okay to make sacrifices if it made everyone else happy.}]
 78:  884| [47] [Yuuri]
 79:  887| [45] [{But today... I've gradually begun to notice something.}]
 80:  892| [47] [Yuuri]
 81:  895| [45] [{That way of thinking just leads to everyone losing lots of things.}]
 82:  900| [47] [Mashiro]
 83:  903| [45] [{...}]
 84:  926| [47] [Yuuri]
 85:  929| [45] [{Mashiron, you've always loved Hikorin, haven't you...? Are you going to abandon those feelings?}]
 86:  934| [47] [Yuuri]
 87:  937| [45] [{That won't make me happy at all!}]
 88:  942| [47] [Mashiro]
 89:  945| [45] [{... Yuuri.}]
 90:  950| [45] [Mashiro's chest tightened as she heard Yuuri's mental voice.]
 91:  955| [45] [Mashiro knew. Yuuri wasn't just saying that to be nice. She was really thinking about Mashiro from the bottom of her heart.]
 92:  960| [45] [It was true. If Mashiro backed out now, she would have wasted nine years of her life thinking about Natsuhiko.]
 93:  965| [47] [Mashiro]
 94:  966| [45] [(But if I backed out...)]
 95:  971| [47] [Mashiro]
 96:  972| [45] [(Would Yuuri be able to have a proper romance with Natsuhiko...?)]
 97:  977| [45] [--Of course not.]
 98:  982| [45] [Just a minute ago, Mashiro was thinking about how she wouldn't have been able to, either.]
 99:  987| [45] [No matter how far apart they were, no matter how different their environments were,%NMashiro and Yuuri had still lived with similar thoughts.]
100:  992| [45] [If either of them backed out, it would cause tension between them and fundamentally change how they could act around Natsuhiko.]
101:  997| [45] [And in the end, it could leave everyone unhappy.]
102: 1002| [47] [Mashiro]
103: 1003| [45] [(Then for everyone to be happy...!)]
104: 1008| [45] [Mashiro looked at Yuuri and sent her telepathy.]
105: 1013| [45] [She mustered up the courage to give her near decade-long friend a decisive declaration.]
106: 1019| [47] [Mashiro]
107: 1022| [45] [{... Hey, Yuuri.}]
108: 1045| [47] [Yuuri]
109: 1048| [45] [{Wh-what?}]
110: 1053| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1056| [45] [{In that case, let's fight over Natsuhiko, fair and square.}]
112: 1061| [45] [It was Mashiro's first clear declaration of rivalry with Yuuri.]
113: 1066| [45] [Yuuri's face shined at the sound of those words.]
114: 1095| [47] [Yuuri]
115: 1098| [45] [{Sure!}]
116: 1121| [47] [Yuuri]
117: 1124| [45] [{Ah, but... even if you say we're gonna fight... I don't think I can win against you, Mashiron...}]
118: 1129| [47] [Mashiro]
119: 1132| [45] [{Well, the feeling's mutual.}]
120: 1155| [47] [Yuuri]
121: 1158| [45] [{R-really?}]
122: 1163| [47] [Mashiro]
123: 1166| [45] [{Well, yeah, really. I know I told you this when we first met, but--}]
124: 1171| [47] [Mashiro]
125: 1174| [45] [{You're so gosh-darn cute, Yuuri.}]
126: 1179| [47] [Mashiro]
127: 1182| [45] [{You're like a doll, and you're super gentle too. I've always admired you.}]
128: 1205| [47] [Yuuri]
129: 1208| [45] [{--}]
130: 1213| [45] [Yuuri's face turned bright red at those words.]
131: 1236| [47] [Yuuri]
132: 1239| [45] [{Th-thank you, Mashiron... In that case, I'll be confident and give it my best.}]
133: 1244| [47] [Mashiro]
134: 1247| [45] [{Good. That's exactly what I want to hear.}]
135: 1252| [45] [The two of them smiled at each other.]
136: 1302| [45] [They then glanced at Natsuhiko as he stared at the surveillance monitor.]
137: 1307| [47] [Mashiro]
138: 1310| [45] [{Good grief... How come two beautiful girls like us gotta fight over such a plain guy like him?}]
139: 1360| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 1363| [45] [{Teehee, I know, right?}]
141: 1368| [47] [Mashiro]
142: 1371| [45] [{Well, he doesn't seem all that reliable on his own... so how about we help him out until everyone can escape?}]
143: 1394| [47] [Yuuri]
144: 1397| [45] [{So we're calling a truce until we get out of here, then?}]
145: 1402| [47] [Mashiro]
146: 1405| [45] [{No, Yuuri. Not a truce. An alliance.}]
147: 1410| [45] [Mashiro answered Yuuri with a smile.]
148: 1482| [45] [--Mashiro felt the darkness filling her mind quietly dissipate.]
149: 1487| [45] [She realized that she had been waiting forever for this day.]
150: 1492| [45] [The day she could find herself in the cliched, yet healthy youthful situation of fighting with the friend she loved over the boy they both loved.]
151: 1497| [45] [And she was sure that if she gave it her very best, without holding back for her best friend--]
152: 1502| [45] [Then even if her love were to crumble, it would crumble without a single regret.]
153: 1563| [47] [Mashiro]
154: 1566| [45] [{... Thank you, Yuuri...}]
155: 1571| [47] [Mashiro]
156: 1574| [45] [{I'm so glad to be your friend.}]
157: 1579| [45] [And with those final words, their time that had been frozen for nine years--]
158: 1584| [45] [Began to move once again.]
