  1:  152| [45] [--In the darkness of the blackout--]
  2:  160| [45] [Natsuhiko, Yuuri, Mashiro, and Ena supported each other as they headed to Area N.]
  3:  165| [45] [As they walked, Natsuhiko told everyone about the epiphany he'd just had.]
  4:  174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  5:  177| [45] ["... Subject N was Ms. Tachibana's little sister."]
  6:  185| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  7:  188| [45] ["They used the same trick they did with Yuuri to fake her death and confine her in LABO."]
  8:  196| [47] [Natsuhiko]
  9:  199| [45] ["It was most likely after the apartment complex gas explosion on April 7, nine years ago..."]
 10:  225| [47] [Mashiro]
 11:  228| [45] ["No way..."]
 12:  254| [47] [Yuuri]
 13:  257| [45] ["That's just... too cruel...!"]
 14:  262| [45] [They spoke with quivering voices.]
 15:  288| [47] [Ena]
 16:  291| [45] ["Then Ms. Tachibana's trying to pass judgment on Q's members... for causing Subject N's death?"]
 17:  299| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 18:  302| [45] ["Yes... or perhaps she simply wants revenge."]
 19:  328| [47] [Ena]
 20:  331| [45] ["Revenge? We're talking about Ms. Tachibana here--"]
 21:  339| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 22:  342| [45] ["Ms. Tachibana's been driven to insanity with intense malice, just as much as Watase was when he shot me."]
 23:  350| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 24:  353| [45] ["The reason why her symptoms didn't manifest for a while was probably because she had no clear target of hatred."]
 25:  361| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 26:  364| [45] ["Or she could also have been holding it back through sheer force of will."]
 27:  557| [45] [But Kazami now knew exactly whom to hate.]
 28:  562| [45] [She even rationalized her intent to murder with the justification that it was "to protect Watase's name" and "to avenge her sister".]
 29:  567| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 30:  568| [45] [(Ms. Tachibana intends to kill Watase and Mr. Ukita...)]
 31:  626| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 32:  627| [45] [(But even malice infection won't completely erase someone's original personality. Even Watase had shown signs of his original self.)]
 33:  660| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 34:  661| [45] [(If Ms. Tachibana, a woman who put her life on the line to -save lives-, were to kill someone, what would happen next--!?)]
 35:  701| [45] [Natsuhiko was struck with an intense unease.]
 36:  706| [45] [They needed to stop Kazami. But how?]
 37:  711| [45] [She had stolen Ena's gun, leaving Natsuhiko's gun their only weapon.]
 38:  783| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 39:  784| [45] [(If I'm correct, there are only two bullets left... but what can do with those?)]
 40:  789| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 41:  790| [45] [(What can we even do with this gun!?)]
 42:  795| [45] [As Natsuhiko touched the gun slung on his belt, Ena sighed and muttered aloud.]
 43:  859| [47] [Ena]
 44:  862| [45] ["Mr. Tenkawa, do you think you can erase Ms. Tachibana's malice?"]
 45:  870| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 46:  873| [45] ["... I think it'd be difficult. She's a completely different case from everyone else."]
 47: 1000| [45] [None of the others' whose malice he had erased had been Communicators.]
 48: 1090| [45] [But Kazami was a Communicator.]
 49: 1096| [45] [She was Subject N's older sister, and through WX particle-induced genetic mutation, she had likely become a Rank S Aptitude Communicator.]
 50: 1164| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 51: 1167| [45] ["The next time I try to repair Ms. Tachibana's memories via Senses Sympathy--"]
 52: 1175| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 53: 1178| [45] ["She could very well manipulate my own memories before I finish."]
 54: 1204| [47] [Mashiro]
 55: 1207| [45] ["Th-then in the worst case scenario..."]
 56: 1233| [47] [Mashiro]
 57: 1236| [45] ["She could erase your memory the very moment you use Senses Sympathy!?"]
 58: 1244| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 59: 1247| [45] ["... I can't deny that possibility."]
 60: 1252| [45] [Actually, that possibility was rather high.]
 61: 1257| [45] [An even worse case scenario was that the shock of memory erasure could damage his brain itself.]
 62: 1262| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 63: 1263| [45] [(If my brain were to get damaged--)]
 64: 1268| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 65: 1269| [45] [(Couldn't that make memory recovery impossible even if I bring Yuuri along!?)]
 66: 1274| [45] [That was to say nothing of the accumulated mental damage his repeated confrontations with Nagisa had wrought.]
 67: 1279| [45] [Ever since he got hit with Kazami's telepathy attack, his head had been aching continuously.]
 68: 1284| [45] [Could his next confrontation with Nagisa bring his mind and spirit to their final limits?]
 69: 1289| [45] [As Natsuhiko fell into despair, Yuuri spoke up beside him.]
 70: 1315| [47] [Yuuri]
 71: 1318| [45] ["But there's still hope."]
 72: 1344| [47] [Ena]
 73: 1347| [45] ["Hope?"]
 74: 1373| [47] [Yuuri]
 75: 1376| [45] ["Unlike me and Hikorin, Ms. Tachibana hasn't done proper BC practice."]
 76: 1384| [47] [Yuuri]
 77: 1387| [45] ["That means she's not necessarily able to use Senses Sympathy at will, you know?"]
 78: 1395| [47] [Yuuri]
 79: 1398| [45] ["Once you dive into Lieutenant Tachibana's brain, if you can erase N--"]
 80: 1424| [47] [Yuuri]
 81: 1427| [45] ["--No, if you can erase -Nagisa- within an exceptionally short amount of time, that should spell victory for us."]
 82: 1453| [47] [Mashiro]
 83: 1456| [45] ["C-can you do it, Natsuhiko...?"]
 84: 1461| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 85: 1462| [45] ["..."]
 86: 1467| [45] [Natsuhiko couldn't answer.]
 87: 1472| [45] [Because that didn't seem like hope at all, but rather nothing more than wishful thinking.]
 88: 1498| [47] [Ena]
 89: 1501| [45] ["I see... In that case..."]
 90: 1529| [47] [Ena]
 91: 1532| [45] ["I guess that means I'll have to be the one to do something, then."]
 92: 1540| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 93: 1543| [45] ["Huh? --Ah!!"]
 94: 1548| [45] [The moment Natsuhiko asked for clarification,]
 95: 1655| [45] [Ena reached for Natsuhiko's belt and snatched his gun.]
 96: 1663| [47] [Natsuhiko]
 97: 1666| [45] ["Wh-what are you doing, Professor!?"]
 98: 1692| [47] [Ena]
 99: 1695| [45] ["If there's a problem you Communicators can't handle, then it's up to us ordinary people to take matters into our own hands."]
100: 1703| [47] [Ena]
101: 1706| [45] ["That's how we at the ESP Bureau have always operated."]
102: 1733| [47] [Mashiro]
103: 1736| [45] ["Wait... Ms. Ena, you don't mean!?"]
104: 1768| [47] [Ena]
105: 1771| [45] ["I'll try to persuade Ms. Tachibana myself. But if that doesn't work--"]
106: 1797| [47] [Ena]
107: 1800| [45] ["I'll shoot to kill."]
108: 1823| [47] [Natsuhiko]
109: 1826| [45] ["...!"]
110: 1852| [47] [Mashiro]
111: 1855| [45] ["No, don't, Ms. Ena...!"]
112: 1863| [47] [Mashiro]
113: 1866| [45] ["Ms. Ena, you said you wanted to -protect- Communicators, didn't you!?"]
114: 1874| [47] [Mashiro]
115: 1877| [45] ["Ms. Tachibana's a Communicator herself! How can you just kill her!?"]
116: 1882| [45] [Ena solemnly replied to Mashiro's plea.]
117: 1908| [47] [Ena]
118: 1911| [45] ["... You kids know exactly how, don't you?"]
119: 1919| [47] [Ena]
120: 1922| [45] ["September 16, sixteen years ago. This city was set aflame. All because of a single,%NN-ified Communicator."]
121: 1930| [47] [Ena]
122: 1933| [45] ["She triggered the mass pandemonium."]
123: 1959| [47] [Ena]
124: 1962| [45] ["And right now, Ms. Tachibana is extremely close to becoming the next Communicator A."]
125: 1970| [47] [Ena]
126: 1973| [45] ["And there's no way I can stand back and watch that happen. I'm a member of the ESP Bureau."]
127: 1978| [45] [Ena grasped the gun tightly. Her eyes were no longer those of a teacher.]
128: 2004| [47] [Ena]
129: 2007| [45] ["I'm sorry... It's too late for me to turn back."]
130: 2033| [47] [Ena]
131: 2036| [45] ["Farewell, my students. Our time together was short, but it's been fun."]
132: 2041| [45] [And with that--]
133: 2079| [45] [Ena rushed towards Area N.]
134: 2087| [47] [Natsuhiko]
135: 2090| [45] ["Professor! Professor, please wait!"]
136: 2095| [45] [Ena wouldn't stop no matter how much Natsuhiko yelled. His screams faded into the darkness.]
137: 2121| [47] [Mashiro]
138: 2124| [45] ["L-let's chase after her, guys!"]
139: 2150| [47] [Yuuri]
140: 2153| [45] ["Yeah!"]
141: 2158| [45] [Yuuri supported Mashiro and Natsuhiko, and the three of them ran.]
142: 2215| [45] [With each step they took, pain ran through the gunshot wounds all over their bodies.]
143: 2220| [45] [The wounds the malice-infected Watase had inflicted.]
144: 2225| [45] [Natsuhiko no longer knew what was right.]
145: 2230| [47] [Natsuhiko]
146: 2231| [45] [(But still--)]
147: 2236| [47] [Natsuhiko]
148: 2237| [45] [(There has to be a route that leads to everyone's survival! There just has to be!)]
149: 2243| [45] [With that conviction in mind, the three Communicators ran.]
150: 2293| [45] [Eventually, they saw the gate to Area N.]
151: 2298| [47] [Natsuhiko]
152: 2299| [45] [(Please don't die on me--!)]
153: 2304| [45] [As Natsuhiko pleaded that thought, the gate opened.]
154: 2414| [45] [--And beyond that gate, they saw--]
155: 2538| [47] [Natsuhiko]
156: 2541| [45] ["!!"]
157: 2555| [45] [Kazami pointing a gun.]
158: 2561| [45] [At a fallen, but uninjured Ukita.]
159: 2567| [45] [It seemed Watase had pushed him away just a second before Kazami had fired.]
160: 2573| [45] [In front of the two men stood Jun, covering them.]
161: 2579| [45] [Beside her was Salyu, standing at the ready.]
162: 2585| [45] [And finally-- beside them was Ena, pointing yet another gun.]
163: 2593| [47] [Ena]
164: 2596| [45] ["Stop this immediately, Ms. Tachibana...!"]
165: 2604| [47] [Ena]
166: 2607| [45] ["This isn't some empty threat this time! Put your gun down right now, or I'll shoot!"]
167: 2616| [47] [Kazami]
168: 2619| [45] ["... Ms. Tsubakiyama... Could you please not interfere just this once?"]
169: 2627| [47] [Kazami]
170: 2630| [45] ["I only want to kill those two. That's all."]
171: 2638| [47] [Kazami]
172: 2641| [45] ["Just Mr. Ukita and Watase. Once I kill those two and avenge my sister--"]
173: 2649| [47] [Kazami]
174: 2652| [45] ["I'll put an end to myself personally."]
175: 2674| [47] [Natsuhiko]
176: 2677| [45] ["!!"]
177: 2682| [45] [The atmosphere froze at those words.]
178: 2691| [47] [Jun]
179: 2694| [45] ["Stop this, Sis! Don't kill them! Don't kill yourself!"]
180: 2703| [47] [Watase]
181: 2706| [45] ["Hold on, Moribe."]
182: 2714| [47] [Watase]
183: 2717| [45] ["I don't care if I die. I deserve as much for my crimes..."]
184: 2726| [47] [Jun]
185: 2729| [45] ["Captain!?"]
186: 2738| [47] [Watase]
187: 2741| [45] ["But Kazami, spare the old man, will you? And this goes without saying, but--"]
188: 2749| [47] [Watase]
189: 2752| [45] ["Don't you dare die, either."]
190: 2758| [45] [After hearing those words, Ukita smiled in self-derision.]
191: 2766| [47] [Ukita]
192: 2769| [45] ["No, if you're going to kill someone, then kill me too... That's my atonement."]
193: 2777| [47] [Ukita]
194: 2780| [45] ["Regardless of my motives, I've caused several victims to--"]
195: 2786| [45] [Salyu interrupted Ukita.]
196: 2794| [47] [Salyu]
197: 2797| [45] ["Kazami Tachibana, let me just say that there's no time."]
198: 2805| [47] [Salyu]
199: 2808| [45] ["If you waste too much time here, I'll take you down myself."]
200: 2814| [47] [Kazami]
201: 2815| [45] ["..."]
202: 2820| [45] [Kazami glared at Watase without so much as a glance to Salyu.]
203: 2866| [45] [The wills of six people clashed.]
204: 2916| [47] [Natsuhiko]
205: 2917| [45] [(Wh... what should I do!?)]
206: 2949| [45] [If this situation were left as it was, then Watase would surely die.]
207: 2981| [45] [Which would naturally make his deal with Yuuri null and void, setting her free.]
208: 3077| [47] [Natsuhiko]
209: 3078| [45] [(But then Ms. Tachibana and Mr. Ukita would die too...!)]
210: 3083| [47] [Natsuhiko]
211: 3084| [45] [(Do I abandon three people to save Yuuri!?)]
212: 3142| [45] [There was no way he could do that.]
213: 3174| [47] [Natsuhiko]
214: 3175| [45] [(Then there really is no other option besides erasing Ms. Tachibana's malice...!)]
215: 3180| [45] [And only Natsuhiko could do it.]
216: 3238| [45] [Only he could use Senses Sympathy on Kazami at that distance.]
217: 3243| [45] [But could he erase her malice?]
218: 3248| [45] [If Nagisa were to defeat Natsuhiko, then it would mean the end of everything.]
219: 3253| [47] [Natsuhiko]
220: 3254| [45] [(... The more time it takes, the more dangerous it'll be...)]
221: 3259| [47] [Natsuhiko]
222: 3260| [45] [(It'll be a big enough risk just searching through Ms. Tachibana's memory for Subject N.)]
223: 3265| [47] [Natsuhiko]
224: 3266| [45] [(In that case... what if I just indiscriminately erase all of Ms. Tachibana's memory...!?)]
225: 3271| [45] [That was a measure that Natsuhiko had forbidden himself from taking.]
226: 3393| [45] [It would indeed be the safer alternative. He had done the same to Watase before.]
227: 3398| [45] [But then Kazami would fall victim to amnesia.]
228: 3450| [45] [The moment that thought crossed Natsuhiko's mind--]
229: 3455| [45] [A voice echoed in his head again.]
230: 3513| [85] [{Save her!}]
231: 3514| [86] [???]
232: 3515| [86] [{Save her!}]
233: 3561| [47] [Natsuhiko]
234: 3564| [45] ["!!"]
235: 3569| [45] [--It was the telepathy Natsuhiko had sent eight hours ago.]
236: 3627| [85] [{Save her!}]
237: 3628| [86] [???]
238: 3629| [86] [{Save her!}]
239: 3657| [45] [The message he had sent to Watase to make him save Yuuri from the flames surrounding her.]
240: 3715| [85] [{Save her!}]
241: 3716| [86] [???]
242: 3717| [86] [{Save her!}]
243: 3745| [45] [The information energy of that message had lingered and now, once again, had returned to Natsuhiko.]
244: 3750| [45] [As if to back up his decision.]
245: 3755| [45] [It was probably just a mere coincidence, but he still felt as if somebody were giving him that command.]
246: 3881| [47] [Natsuhiko]
247: 3882| [45] [(Ghh...!)]
248: 3887| [45] [When he looked around, it appeared that only Natsuhiko had heard that telepathy.]
249: 3892| [47] [Natsuhiko]
250: 3893| [45] [(... You don't have to tell me!)]
251: 3898| [47] [Natsuhiko]
252: 3899| [45] [(There's only one thing I need to do!)]
253: 3906| [45] [And thus-- Natsuhiko made up his mind.]
254: 3951| [47] [Natsuhiko]
255: 3952| [45] [(I have to decide what it is that I need to do!)]
256: 3959| [45] [--Natsuhiko thought, and then--]
257: 3964| [45] [He made up his mind.]
258: 4085| [47] [Natsuhiko]
259: 4088| [45] ["--Yuuri!!"]
260: 4149| [45] [Natsuhiko quickly grasped Yuuri's hand and dove into Kazami's memories.]
