Next, he put the teacher and the learner in separate rooms and had the teacher ask the learner questions through an intercom. The experimenter instructed the teacher to send stronger and stronger electric shocks to the learner for each incorrectly answered question. Whenever a teacher became hesitant, the experimenter firmly insisted they continue, and thus, for the most part, the teachers calmly ended up administering electric shocks at even fatal voltages...\nSince loss of life wasn't a goal in the experiment, though, the test subjects assigned the role of learners were simply planted actors.

It is a process that everybody goes through, yet nobody knows the specifics even to this day.\nHalfway through the 20th century, the mainstream theory of infant language acquisition was that infants learned by imitating how their parents spoke with other adults. Thus, there were some attempts to interpret the linguistic structures of infant babbling, but the results were fruitless. Not even adults speak consistently with perfect grammar. Furthermore, discovering the linguistic structures of languages is a difficult task for adults as well. In contrast, American linguist Avram Noam Chomsky proposed that perhaps humans were innately born with the fundamental knowledge systems for language speaking. He inspired a new school of thought on linguistics, putting the focus not on the words said, but on the ability to form said words.\nLinguistics, cognitive science, structuralism, neuroscience...

According to that hypothesis, inspection of the IGF2R gene would allow for the screening of so-called \"espers\" who possessed extra-sensory perception. Many scholars brushed off the theory as mere quackery, but the plausibility of ESP's existence began to spread by mouth throughout the town.\nAnd in February 2014, Alice Enflamme, age 18 at the time, underwent a genetic test on the basis of the theory.

    "developer_comment": "The release of energy from the decay, fusion, or fission of an atomic nucleus. Since nuclear fission in particular generates vast amounts of energy from small amounts of fuel, nuclear power generation is used today as a source of electricity.\nUranium is the typical example of an element that easily undergoes nuclear fission. By hitting a uranium atom with a neutron, the atom emits heat energy as it splits into two and emits free neutrons of its own. A nuclear reactor uses this property to chain the reactions of multiple uranium fissions consecutively. The vast heat energy generates steam which turns the turbines of a power generator, thereby generating electrical energy.\nHowever, even the correct usage of nuclear power produces radiation and radioactive waste. Thus, nuclear power plants must be prepared in the event of a meltdown, where radioactive waste can contaminate the soil and create victims. In that regard, nuclear power isn't an unconditionally welcomed technology, but perhaps a \"necessary evil\" to allow people to live comfortably--\nat least, that's the thought that's taken root in a considerable amount of people.\nIt has been over a hundred years after German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen had discovered the type of radiation known as the X-ray in 1895. A time longer than the lives of most humans, but little more than a fleeting moment in the scale of human history.\nShould we rid ourselves of nuclear power or control it...? The humans living today may perhaps be at the crossroads of that decision.",

While calculations of information entropy are certainly analogous to those of the thermodynamic sort, this hypothesis was audacious enough to shoehorn the information theory definition of entropy into an elementary particle, and was thus initially ignored.\nFor starters, the suggestion of information-energy equivalence is nothing else but the suggestion that information can be changed into energy. Roughly speaking, this hypothesis would not only explain the accelerating expansion of the universe, but also supernatural phenomena known from time immemorial like extrasensory perception.\nThe scientific community at the time laughed it off as a thought experiment like Maxwell's demon.\nBut their laughter froze after the Andresy Witch Hunt. After the occurrence of that incident, the informational field hypothesis was extensively revisited, and came to be considered the key to solving the mysteries of BC as many scientists try to find experimental counter-evidence.\nMany scientists still find it hard to accept this fifth force. Defining it officially as a fifth force would crumble the standard model of physics that had previously explained everything with four fundamental forces of nature. Thus, a huge paradigm shift could occur, redefining what common sense once thought impossible to be possible.\nThe day the \"informational field hypothesis\" officially becomes the \"informational field theory\" will be the day humanity opens up a door to a new world.",

Speed is often known in relative terms, and it is hard to tell for sure exactly how fast you are moving. Even when you measure an object's speed, you merely measure its speed in relation to the ground-- This is an example of Galileo Galilei's principle of relativity. Does the earth move, or does the sun move? It is difficult to know for sure, which is why the geocentric model pervaded for so long before Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model.\nBut in 1905, a certain Albert Einstein discovered that the speed of light remained constant regardless of the frame of reference (principle of invariant light speed), and based on the aforementioned principle of relativity, he announced the \"special principle of relativity\" and its matching special theory of relativity. The \"special\" refers to how it only applies to a \"special\" coordinate system (called an inertial coordinate system) that accounts only for the inertia working on an object, and not the gravity working on it. The addition of accounting for gravity is called the general theory of relativity. The theory of relativity refers to both special and general forms. E=mc^2, the mass-energy equivalence formula used in the special theory of relativity, is said to be one of the most beautiful formulas on earth and is known by many.\n\"E\" is energy, \"m\" is mass, and \"c\" is the speed of light in a vacuum.\nMiyoko Tenkawa has her own unique ideas about this formula:\n\"An enormous release of energy requires an equivalently large loss of mass\"--\nadapting this idea to her own circumstances, she thinks that \"a large success requires an equivalently large sacrifice\". To clear a path for her beloved son's future, she had to abandon even their mutual trust and familial bond in order to devote herself to research...

Never again would he allow her to go through that awful experience--\nAs he renewed his determination, sleepiness overcame him.\nIt was the day of Yuuri Kotono's yearly rendezvous.\nAs she watched the boy's sleeping face, she thought back to the events of the previous year. She pondered about the year to come. It was just once a year, but it was a blessing for her-- that was what she had set her heart on.\nIt was the day of her \"death anniversary\" as well.\nIt was the day Mashiro Toba felt the most melancholic each year.\nYearly hospital examinations normally took half a day, but for some reason, Natsuhiko's took an entire day. And it was Yuuri's death anniversary as well... So it had become a habit of Mashiro's to look at the night sky on this day. There she'd see the Summer Triangle. Hikoboshi, Altair of Aquila, the eagle. Orihime, Vega of Lyra, the harp. And finally, Deneb of Cygnus, the swan. It was said that the wings of the kasasagi were what allowed Hikoboshi and Orihime their yearly rendezouvs.\nWhy couldn't it have been the wings of the swan? Mashiro pondered that question.\n\nSeptember 16, 2029.\nWatase Kasasagi's sleep was interrupted by a nightmare, and for no particular reason, he looked out the window to the night sky. It was not yet the ideal time to see it, but the Winter Triangle was there nonetheless. Betelgeuse of Orion, the hunter. Procyon of Canis Minor, the small dog. And finally, Sirius of Canis Major, the big dog. What connected Betelgeuse, Procyon, and Sirius were AD, Rokumei City, LABO... and BC. The lifesaving Sirius now had to become a hound that hunted BC. Meticulous preparation was necessary for that hunt, but he swore he would succeed...\nHe surrendered himself to dark emotions and softly closed his eyes.\nOn the decisive day, one year later, the Kasasagi would finally move.\nSolely to bring Orihime and Hikoboshi together again--",

We as humans each see an entire world that others can't. Or perhaps we couldn't, until now that is. Because now, it's all made possible by the existence of BC.\nMiyoko Tenkawa, the physicist who first proposed the informational field hypothesis, stated that the true form of the human consciousness is the M particles that have copied the information on the brain. In that case, everything inside the skull is another world. While all people live in the same world, each person has their own different world that nobody else can understand.\nBC therefore allows for communication between parallel worlds, which means BC still has much potential left to uncover.\nThe worlds in other people's heads aren't the only worlds that we can't perceive. Take Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation. The omnipresent, human-intervening Third Man factor... These could all possibly be explained by BC.\nIf we put empathy to practical use, we could perceive unknown parallel worlds and paranormal existences... no, perhaps we could even communicate with those things.\nI know this might sound crazy. But think about it. Just 20 years ago, even BC was laughed off as crazy talk--\n\nObserving parallel worlds and communicating with unknown existences...\nPerhaps BC does indeed have that sort of power.\nIn any case, if those things were to hypothetically exist, then perhaps only the most exceptionally powerful of Rank S Aptitude Communicators could reach the level necessary to contact them.\nIt would require the emission of tremendous amounts of information energy to even transcend the \"boundaries\" of the world.

In other words, the \"spirit\" lies within these particles.\n\nM particles (M fermions)\nA new type of fermi particle that takes on BC energy interactions. Since these particles form human thought, they are named M for Mind. Two of the fundamental interactions, the strong force and the weak force, do not affect these particles. These particles require high levels of energy to remain stable. While they may be safe inside the treasure trove of information that is the brain, M particles immediately decay into W particles after leaving the brain. This is why ordinary people cannot relay thoughts without using an intermediary like speech or writing. Only Communicators can use BC to convert W particles into M particles intracerebrally.\n\nW particles (W fermions)\nA new type of fermi particle even smaller than the tiny neutrino. With a low-energy state, W particles are unaffected by gravitational, strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, and thus have yet to be discovered. The W stands for Wanderer as W particles drift through the air without information. While W particles cannot reproduce information by themselves, a Communicator can load them with information similar to \"human mental activity\" like consciousness, intentions, or thoughts, converting the W particles into high-energy state M particles (otherwise, WX particles). In this state, they are now affected by electromagnetic forces.\n\nb particles (b boson)\nBosonic particles that transmit BC energy (information volume). The \"informational field hypothesis\" proposed the existence of such particles, but just like gravitons, they have not yet been observed. One of the components of the hypothesis that cannot escape the limitations of a hypothesis. Incidentally, the fundamental process of BC energy generation uses the internal heat energy of the body. The existence of high metabolism heavy eaters who stay thin (Communicator and non-Communicator alike) can perhaps partially be explained due to this property.\n\nWX particles\nArtificially amplified W particles. The X stands for eXtreme. These particles have surpassed the energy threshold for becoming M particles, but lack any information meaningful to humans, which is where the distinction is drawn. When a Communicator uses WX particles to produce M particles, the resulting particles take longer to decay than if they had used W particles instead. In effect, a WX particle-rich environment increases effective BC range. However, WX particles have been proven to be harmful to the body, and thus extended exposure to fixed amounts can cause brain dysfunction, genetic disorders, and cancer, while acute exposure can cause sensory abnormalities, nausea, and hazy consciousness.",

Evacuation mode unlocks the doors to all rooms as well as the security gates that usually automatically relock after a certain period of time. However, the retina authentication for the elevator from Area N to Area Zero remains locked.\n\nA Case N is declared when Subject N is improperly taken outside of Area N or Area 5. The security gates lock and the bulkheads to the surface shut, preventing Subject N's escape. Researchers and staff members promptly administer AD and are generally instructed to remain on standby until outside help arrives.\n\nNine years ago, during the \"Subject N escape incident\", a fire-triggered evacuation mode and a Case N were declared one after the other, causing the security gates to temporarily open for only a short period of time before relocking. Furthermore, the bulkheads shut, preventing escape to the surface.\nBut since at that time, there was a way to open the bulkheads from the outside, Miyoko managed to narrowly escape the flames and bring Natsuhiko and Yuuri to safety.\nThat event was fortunate in itself, but one person saw the security feature Miyoko used to be dangerous. This person was Ryoken Kashiwagi, then senior fellow.\nKashiwagi hypothesized that the ability to open the bulkheads from the outside meant that had the Case N happened during not a simple evacuation mode, but a \"meltdown\" instead,\nthat is, had a malfunction caused the WX amplifier to go haywire, then Subject N could have utilized the amplified WX particles to invoke Senses Sympathy on someone outside to manipulate them to open the bulkheads and allow her to escape. Fearing this worst-case scenario, Kashiwagi amended the security measures so that in the event of a simultaneous meltdown and Case N, nobody on the inside (or obviously the outside for that matter) could open the bulkheads until \"Brain Cell\" confirmed the neutralization of the \"meltdown\" and opened up the bulkheads automatically. Thus, Subject N's escape would be prevented, though at the potential sacrifice of the researchers and staff members who didn't escape in time.\nWas the motivation for enacting such a drastic security measure the cowardly fear of exposing the truth behind LABO, or was it a modest sense of justice to protect the general public from potential danger...?

    "developer_comment": "A general term referring to alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, neutron rays, and other particle beams and electromagnetic waves.\nRadioactive materials have unstable structures and thus decay over time. Radiation is the emission of energy or particles after such decay.\nExamples of radiation include alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, and neutron rays, each with their own degrees of penetrating power and effects on the human body. In terms of penetrating power,\ngamma > neutron > beta > alpha.\n\nAlpha rays can be stopped with a thin sheet of paper, thus there is no need to fear alpha radiation exposure as long as it is not internal. In contrast, beta rays are stopped by things such as aluminum; Neutron rays by water, boron, and carbon; Gamma rays require steel or lead... And thus the difficulty of radiation shielding varies greatly between these types.\nIn terms of harm to human bodies,\nalpha > neutron > beta > gamma.\n\nNeutron rays rank highly dangerous in both categories. The neutron bomb uses neutron radiation, which is why sci-fi writers often prefix the names of fictional weapons with the word \"neutron\".\nRadioactive material decays at a fixed probability over a given length of time. Thus, the time it takes for a particular proportion of a given material to decay is approximately constant. The length of time it takes for half of a material to decay is called the material's half-life. Half of a radioactive material decaying means the material's danger to humans has been reduced to a half. Thus, the half-life of a radioactive material is one criterion in deciding how to handle it.\nFor example, Iodine-131 (I-131) has a half-life of approximately 8 days.\nCesium-137 (Cs-137) has a half-life of approximately 30 years. Some nuclides don't reach their half-life for thousands or millions of years. Also, it's incorrect to assume that since half of Iodine-131 decays in 8 days that all of it decays in 16 days. At 8 days, you have 1/2, at 16 days, you have 1/4, at 24 days, you have 1/8, and so on...

However, since it only counts the number, and not the strength of the events, it cannot measure the amount of radiation energy, and tends to overestimate actual radiation dosage (to account for measurement error). The Geiger counter is relatively cheap and aimed at personal ownership.\nA scintillation counter measures radiation energy based on the pulses of visible light released by a scintillator in response to radiation. An ionization chamber survey meter calculates radiation dosage by the amount of ions generated from radiation passing through a hermetically sealed containers of gas. Nuclear power facilities and monitoring posts at every prefecture measure radiation dosage periodically, even outside of crises.

Generating heat from electricity is easy, but generating electricity from heat is difficult.This fundamental property of energy is explained by the second law of thermodynamics. As long as no work is added to a system, this law is absolute.\nNow, suppose we have a demon. What separates this demon from humans is that it can perceive the movement of particles. Let us put him (or her?) in charge of a box. This box has two sides sectioned off by a wall with a small door. One side contains a gas at a uniform temperature. When the demon notices a fast particle moving toward the door from that side, he opens the door. He keeps herding these fast particles onto one side. The movement of the fast particles generates heat. So without adding any changes to the system, the demon has divided a body of uniform temperature into a warm side and a cool side. This action contradicts the second law of thermodynamics.\nThis thought experiment was proposed by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and is known as Maxwell's demon.\nIt's easy to just say that the demon doesn't exist. However, unless you can prove that the demon doesn't exist, you cannot dismiss the thought experiment as illogical. The demon's existence is, shall we say, a devil's proof. But the devil is in the details.\nFor nearly 150 long years, Maxwell's demon had tormented physicists, but eventually it was confirmed that the observation and screening of particles was impossible without the consumption of energy, thus reconciling the demon's contradiction with the second law.\nIn 2010, a joint research team from the University of Tokyo and Chuo University successfully produced energy using observational information alone, thus converting information into energy.

For example, the Tokyo Fire Department has Hyper Rescue and the Kyoto Fire Department has Super Command Rescue.\nHyper Rescue did especially remarkable work after the 2004 Niigata Chuetsu earthquake, and thus the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications revised the aforementioned ordinance in 2006. Above the classification of special rescue squad, elite rescue squad and special elite rescue squad were established, providing nationwide rescue preparedness in the face of disasters.\nElite rescue squads are deployed in large-scale disasters and are often called Super Rescue while special elite rescue squads are deployed in even more serious NBC disasters and are often called Hyper Rescue.\nThe Rokumei City Fire Department Special Elite Rescue Squad Sirius is at this highest level.",

There were 118 deaths and 232 injuries. The suspects caught red-handed by the police were members of the citizen's group, the \"Anti-BC League\".

The completely N-ified Communicator A escaped from the facility. She used Senses Sympathy on the people she came across on her path, amplifying their malice and causing them to commit acts of violence.\nSome set fires. Others stabbed citizens with knives. One person even attacked a police officer and stole a gun. (It is thought that some of A's memories of her time in France as Alice Enflamme had some influence in their actions.)\nThe situation was thought to have been beyond all help, but the commissioner in charge of A, Jin Tsubakiyama, was able to safely secure her.
